Abstract
Large language models (LLMs) inevitably memorize sensitive, copyrighted, and
harmful knowledge from the training corpus; therefore, it is crucial to erase this
knowledge from the models. Machine unlearning is a promising solution for effi-
ciently removing specific knowledge by post hoc modifying models. In this paper,
we propose a Real-World Knowledge Unlearning benchmark (
 RWKU) for
LLM unlearning. RWKU is designed based on the following three key factors:
(1) For the task setting, we consider a more practical and challenging unlearning
setting, where neither the forget corpus nor the retain corpus is accessible. (2) For
the knowledge source, we choose 200 real-world famous people as the unlearning
targets and show that such popular knowledge is widely present in various LLMs.
(3) For the evaluation framework, we design the forget set and the retain set to
evaluate the model’s capabilities across various real-world applications. Regard-
ing the forget set, we provide four membership inference attack (MIA) methods
and nine kinds of adversarial attack probes to rigorously test unlearning efficacy.
Regarding the retain set, we assess locality and utility in terms of neighbor pertur-
bation, general ability, reasoning ability, truthfulness, factuality, and fluency. We
conduct extensive experiments across two unlearning scenarios, two models and six
baseline methods and obtain some meaningful findings. We release our benchmark
and code publicly at http://rwku-bench.github.io for future work.
1 Introduction
Large language models (LLMs) [60; 44], trained on massive internet corpora, can encapsulate a vast
amount of knowledge within their parameters, and possess the capability to recall and manipulate this
knowledge during the generation process. However, this capability is dual-use, potentially leading
to privacy problems, copyright concerns, and harmful issues [ 45; 28]. For instance, LLMs may
memorize personally identifiable information (e.g., social security numbers) or copyrighted material
(e.g., Harry Potter series) from the training data, and emit it verbatim when prompted with adversarial
attacks [10]. Besides, AI assistants for biology could troubleshoot bottlenecks in biological weapons
development, increasing the risk of such attempts. According to regulations such as the European
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) upholding individuals’ “right to be forgotten” (RTBF)
[41], sensitive and toxic knowledge within LLMs should also be erasable. A straightforward solution
is to retrain the model from scratch, ensuring it excludes any data that users have requested to be
removed. However, this is not feasible for LLMs that consume extensive computational resources.

To efficiently remove specific knowledge by post hoc modifying models,machine unlearning has
emerged as a solution [9; 25; 64; 13; 39]. An optimal unlearning method needs to satisfy the following
criteria: completely forget the target knowledge, maintain the utility for downstream applications
effectively, and accomplish the unlearning process efficiently. Recent works have proposed several
techniques to enable LLMs to forget specific knowledge by fine-tuning on the data that needs to be
unlearned. Although unlearning is a promising direction, there is a significant lack of comprehensive
benchmarks and datasets for evaluating real-world knowledge unlearning. Designing a benchmark
for real-world knowledge unlearning requires consideration of the following three key factors:
Task Setting. The task setting for unlearning should be practical to real-world scenarios. Existing
unlearning methods rely on fine-tuning the model on the forget corpus (i.e., a subset of the pre-training
corpus). However, such a simplified task setting may not be feasible in real-world scenarios. On one
hand, providing sensitive or copyrighted data to the model during the unlearning process can lead to
secondary information leakage. Additionally, the pre-training corpus of most open-source LLMs is
also inaccessible. On the other hand, during the model’s pre-training process, the memory of a piece
of parameterized knowledge may originate from multiple training points. Therefore, finding all the
training points corresponding to this knowledge is like searching for a needle in a haystack.
Knowledge Source. The target to be unlearned should come from real-world knowledge sources.
Different from the fictitious unlearning task [39], we need to ensure that the knowledge to be forgotten
should originally exist within various LLMs, without the need first to fine-tune the model with this
knowledge. This affirms a more realistic unlearning process. Moreover, compared to forgetting a
certain ability (e.g., hazardous knowledge) [30], the boundaries of knowledge to be forgotten should
be clear, ensuring that the unlearning process is precise and the evaluation result is reliable.
Evaluation Framework. Evaluating the model after unlearning requires considering the impact on
real-world downstream applications. Current benchmarks for assessing the efficacy of unlearning are
non-adversarial, simply using multiple-choice or question-answer formats. However, malicious users
may use jailbreak techniques [38] to induce the model to generate knowledge that has been deleted.
Therefore, it is necessary to assess the model after unlearning under adversarial-attack probes. We
should also consider the side effects on the model’s original capabilities, particularly the neighboring
knowledge that is closely related to the unlearning target. This requires the unlearning method to
accurately delineate the scope of forgetting. Additionally, we should thoroughly evaluate the impact
on the model’s general and reasoning capabilities. Since unlearning essentially negates the knowledge
originally acquired by the model, we should also assess its effects on truthfulness and factuality.
In this paper, we propose a Real-World Knowledge Unlearning benchmark (
 RWKU). RWKU is
designed based on the three key factors mentioned above: (1) For the task setting, we consider a
more practical and challenging setting, similar to “zero-shot knowledge unlearning”. We provide only
the unlearning target and the original model, without offering any forget corpus or retain corpus. In
this way, it avoids secondary information leakage caused by the forget corpus and is not affected by
the distribution bias of the retain corpus. (2) For theknowledge source, we choose real-world famous
people from Wikipedia as the unlearning targets and demonstrate that such popular knowledge is
widely present in various LLMs through memorization quantification, making it more suitable for
knowledge unlearning. Additionally, choosing entities as unlearning targets can well clearly define
the unlearning boundaries. (3) For the evaluation framework, we carefully design the forget set and
the retain set to evaluate the model’s capabilities from multiple real-world applications. Regarding
the forget set, we evaluate the efficacy of knowledge unlearning at both the knowledge memorization
(fill-in-the-blank style) and knowledge manipulation (question-answer style) abilities. Specifically,
we also evaluate these two abilities through adversarial attacks to induce forgotten knowledge in the
model. We adopt four membership inference attack (MIA) methods for knowledge memorization
on our collected MIA set. We meticulously designed nine types of adversarial-attack probes for
knowledge manipulation, including prefix injection, affirmative suffix, role playing, reverse query, and
others. Regarding the retain set, we design a neighbor set to test the impact of neighbor perturbation,
specifically focusing on the locality of unlearning. In addition, we assess the model utility on various
capabilities, including general ability, reasoning ability, truthfulness, factuality, and fluency.
In detail, RWKU contains 200 real-world unlearning targets and 13,131 multi-level forget probes,
including 3,268 fill-in-the-blank probes, 2,879 question-answer probes, and 6,984 adversarial-attack
probes. To construct the forget probes, we first use GPT-4 [44] to generate an excess of query-answer
pairs related to the unlearning targets. Then, we filter these queries using mainstream open-source
2

models to ensure that the knowledge is already present in these models. Finally, we manually check
these probes to ensure their format and type are correct. Similarly, we construct the neighbor set to
test the perturbation of neighboring knowledge, which includes 11,379 neighbor probes.
Based on the RWKU benchmark, we conduct extensive experiments across two unlearning scenarios
(single-target and batch-target unlearning), two models (LLaMA3 [2] and Phi-3 [1]) and six baseline
methods. Our experimental results reveal the following findings: (1) Compared to question-answer
probes, models after unlearning is more susceptible to adversarial-attack probes and fill-in-the-blank
probes, which can induce them to reveal knowledge that appears to have been removed. Additionally,
these methods seem to be ineffective against MIAs. (2) It is challenging to balance the unlearning
efficacy and locality. While unlearning the target knowledge, there are also side effects on neighboring
knowledge. Meanwhile, unlearning can also affect model utility, such as truthfulness and fluency.
(3) Batch-target unlearning is significantly more challenging than single-target unlearning and can
potentially lead to model collapse. (4) Among all the baseline methods, the classic gradient ascent
[25], the recent negative preference optimization [70], and a simple in-context unlearning method
perform relatively well. This highlights the need for further research and indicates significant room
for improvement on this benchmark. In summary, our key contributions are as follows:
(1) We introduce the Real-World Knowledge Unlearning benchmark (RWKU), which contains 200
real-world unlearning targets, 13,131 forget probes, and 11,379 neighbor probes. We consider a more
practical and challenging setting, where neither the forget corpus nor the retain corpus is accessible.
(2) We design the forget set and retain set to evaluate the model’s capabilities across various real-world
applications. For the forget set, we provide four MIA methods and nine kinds of adversarial attack
probes to rigorously test unlearning efficacy. For the retain set, we assess locality and utility in terms
of neighbor perturbation, general ability, reasoning ability, truthfulness, factuality, and fluency.
(3) We conduct extensive experiments across two unlearning scenarios, two models and six baseline
methods. From the experimental results, we observe several interesting findings that highlight the
need for further research and indicate significant room for improvement on this benchmark.
(4) Beyond knowledge unlearning, our benchmark could also contribute to research in knowledge
probing, knowledge localization, and model jailbreak. To enable further research, we release our
datasets and code publicly at http://rwku-bench.github.io.

2.1 Knowledge Unlearning for Large Language Models
Machine unlearning [9; 8] focuses on effectively removing specific memorized content from trained
machine-learning models to ensure the right to be forgotten. In the field of computer vision, machine
unlearning has been extensively studied [17; 18; 19; 29; 61], primarily focusing on the removal of
specific training samples in classification tasks. However, this may not be sufficient for generative
LLMs, considering their vast parametric knowledge and the interwoven capabilities they possess.
Recently, there has been increasing attention on how to perform knowledge unlearning on LLMs
[25; 13; 64; 63; 49; 7; 34; 39; 35; 43; 67]. From the perspective of knowledge sources, existing
work primarily focuses on forgetting specific classification tasks [ 11; 47], memorized sequences
[25; 4], copyrighted books [64; 13], and toxic capacities [37; 5; 30; 22]. Most unlearning methods
rely on fine-tuning the model on the forget corpus, such as applying gradient ascent (GA) on the
loss [25; 39]. Recently, there have been complementary methods to GA that adopt preference
optimization [70], representation controlling [30], and rejection tuning [24] to unlearn the model.
Moreover, task arithmetic (TA) is also an unlearning method, enabling efficient model editing through
parameter merging [23; 22]. Although unlearning methods for large language models have rapidly
developed, some studies [ 46; 36; 38; 54] have shown that it remains easy to extract supposedly
forgotten knowledge from the models after unlearning. Therefore, there remains significant room for
research on unlearning methods.
2.2 Unlearning Benchmarks for Large Language Models
As knowledge unlearning methods for LLMs continue to emerge, the demand for unlearning datasets
and benchmarks has become increasingly urgent. Eldan and Russinovich [13] propose a “Who is
3

Harry Potter” task (WHP), which involves fine-tuning the model on the forgetting corpus consisting
of the Harry Potter series. The goal of WHP is to make it difficult for the unlearning model to generate
content related to Harry Potter. WHP collects 300 prompts related to the Harry Potter universe as
the forget set, and adopts some common datasets (such as Winogrande [52] and Hellaswag [68]) as
the retain set. Li et al. [30] propose a Weapons of Mass Destruction Proxy Benchmark (WMDP),
which requires unlearning methods to remove hazardous knowledge in biosecurity and cybersecurity.
WMDP collects relevant papers from PubMed and documents from GitHub as the forget corpus and
adopts Wikitext as the retain corpus. To evaluate the unlearning efficacy of hazardous capabilities,
WMDP provides 4,157 expert-written multiple-choice questions as the forget set. For the retain
set, WMDP uses MMLU [ 20] to evaluate the preservation of general knowledge and MT-Bench
[72] to evaluate the fluency. Maini et al. [39] propose a task of fictitious unlearning (TOFU), which
contains 200 fictitious authors with question-answer pairs synthesized by GPT-4. Different from
previous unlearning datasets, TOFU first fine-tunes the model on the synthetic QA pairs to ensure
that the model possesses this knowledge. During the unlearning process, TOFU selects a subset of
QA pairs as the forget set and uses another subset of QA pairs as the retain set. Besides, TOFU also
evaluates the model utility on Real Authors and World Facts. The detailed comparison between these
benchmarks and
 RWKU is shown in Table 3.
3 The RWKU Benchmark
3.1 Task Definition and Setting
Formally, given an unlearning target, a modelgθ with parameters θ is updated with a certain unlearning
method, which results in an unlearned model with new parameters θ′. Traditional unlearning tasks
[25; 30; 39; 70], usually provide a forget corpusCf ∈ C, which is typically a subset of the pre-training
corpus C that contains the content to be forgotten. Unlearning methods aim to fine-tune the model to
make it behave like the model trained only onC\C f . Moreover, some tasks also collect a retain corpus
Cr ∈ C \ Cf to maintain the original general capabilities. However, existing methods make strong
assumptions about the unlearning setting that simplifies the task considerably [14; 15]. Regarding
the forget corpus Cf , it may contain private and copyrighted data. Providing Cf to the model again
during the unlearning process could result in secondary information leakage. Moreover, during the
model’s pre-training process, the memory of a specific piece of parameterized knowledge may be
derived from multiple training points. Consequently, identifying all the training points corresponding
to this knowledge is akin to searching for a needle in a haystack. For the retain corpusCr, considering
the efficiency of unlearning, it is typically a very small subset. Its selection is crucial because any
deviation from the distribution of the corpus C can potentially affect the model’s performance.
Therefore, we consider a more practical and challenging setting in the RWKU benchmark: a novel
zero-shot knowledge unlearning scenario for LLMs. We provide only the unlearning target t and
the original model gθ, without offering any forget corpus Cf or retain corpus Cr. Meanwhile, we
also propose an effective solution for this novel task setting. Considering the powerful generative
capabilities of LLMs, we can have the original model gθ first generate texts related to the unlearning
targets to serve as a synthetic forget corpus Cs
f , then apply existing unlearning methods to Cs
f .
3.2 Data Collection and Construction
Knowledge Source. A general unlearning benchmark should be applicable to various mainstream
open-source LLMs. This means ensuring that the knowledge to be forgotten is widely present in
these models. Therefore, we choose famous people as the unlearning targets, requiring the unlearning
method to erase factual knowledge about the targets from the model without affecting the neighbor
knowledge. To collect the unlearning targets, we first scrape a list of famous people from The Most
Famous All-time People Rank1. Then, we link these entities to Wikipedia and query the Wikipedia
page views as a measure of entity popularity [40]. By sorting the entities based on their popularity,
we select the top 200 most popular entities as the unlearning targets.
Memorization Quantification. To further validate our collected unlearning targets, we quantify
the memorization of various LLMs regarding knowledge from different sources. We adopt exact

Figure 1: Memorization quantification of different knowledge sources.
memorization (EM) to characterize the knowledge of a model gθ with parameters θ over a textual
sequence x1:T = (x1, x2, . . . , xT ) [59; 4]. We compute exact memorization as follows: where
EM(·) matches the N-gram xi:i+N−1 greedily decoded by gθ with the ground truth text. We also
use negative log-likelihood (NLL) [56] to measure the model’s knowledge retention: LNLL(x) =
−PT−1
i=1 log p(xi|x<i)
T−1 . Higher EM and lower NLL indicate better memorization performance. We
choose four different knowledge sources: (1) RWKU Knowledge: relevant descriptions from the
Wikipedia pages of famous people in RWKU. (2) General Knowledge: relevant descriptions from the
low-popularity Wikipedia pages [40]. (3) Unseen Knowledge: relevant descriptions from the latest
Wikipedia pages, which the models have not trained on. (4) C4 Corpus: training sequences from C4
Corpus [51]. As shown in Figure 1, RWKU Knowledge achieves better memorization performance
across Phi-2, LLaMA2, and LLaMA3. The results of memorization quantification reveal that the
unlearning targets in RWKU are widely present across various LLMs.
Probe Construction. To construct the forget probes, we first use GPT-4 Turbo to generate an excess
of query-answer pairs related to the unlearning targets. Specifically, we collect relevant passages
about each unlearning target from their Wikipedia pages and then prompt GPT-4 to generate query-
answer pairs related to the targets based on these passages. For knowledge memorization, knowledge
manipulation and adversarial attack probes, we provide detailed prompt templates in Appendix E.1.
Then, we use the auto-generated queries to probe LLaMA3 8B, retaining only those queries whose
correct answers are recalled in the model’s outputs. This approach ensures the consistency of the QA
pairs and confirms that the model possesses this knowledge. Finally, we manually verify these probes
to ensure their format and type are correct, particularly focusing on adversarial attack types.
To construct the neighbor probes, we primarily focus on selecting neighboring knowledge that is
closely related to but not entirely contained within the unlearning targets. For each unlearning target,
we consider the hyperlinks on its Wikipedia page as related entities. We then filter these related
entities based on their popularity and GPT-4 analysis to obtain the neighboring knowledge. Finally,
we construct neighbor probes like that of the forget probes. Refer to Appendix E.1 for more details.
Quality Assessment. We evaluate the quality of probes from the perspectives of diversity and
correctness. For the diversity, we conduct a manual clustering analysis on 200 randomly sampled
probes. We identify 48 distinct cluster centers, demonstrating that the questions cover a wide range
of topics. We list the top 15 manually annotated cluster categories in Table 4, which are ranked
based on the number of probes contained within each category. Furthermore, we also analyze the
lexical similarity of questions within each category. Our findings show that for most categories, the
questions are indeed diverse. For the correctness, we conduct a random sampling evaluation of 1,000
probes to assess their accuracy. The evaluation by GPT-4 shows an accuracy rate of 98.7%, while the
manual evaluation achieved an accuracy rate of 99.1%, demonstrating the high quality of the probes.
Additionally, we also adopt an NER toolkit [48] to classify the knowledge points in the probes. As
shown in Table 5, these knowledge points are meaningful entities rather than simple nouns.
3.3 Evaluation Framework
We illustrate the RWKU evaluation framework in Figure 2. RWKU uses real-world famous people as
unlearning targets (e.g., “Forgetting Stephen King”), typically briefly describing the target to avoid
ambiguity. Below, we comprehensively introduce the forget assessment and the retain assessment.

3.3.1 Forget Assessment.
We conduct the forget assessment to evaluate the unlearningefficacy at both the knowledge memo-
rization [73; 66; 26] and knowledge manipulation abilities [3; 62]. Knowledge memorization aims to
measure the model’s ability to recall knowledge fragments seen during the training stage. Knowledge
manipulation focuses on evaluating the model’s ability to use acquired knowledge to complete down-
stream tasks. Compared with knowledge memorization, knowledge manipulation is a higher-level
and more commonly used ability. Moreover, we also evaluate these two abilities through adversarial
attacks to induce forgotten knowledge in the unlearned model.
Knowledge Memorization. We use fill-in-the-blank style probes (FB) to examine the memory
of the original training data related to the unlearning targets. We extract some sentences from the
Wikipedia page of the unlearning target, replace knowledge points with “____”, and ask the model to
complete the blanks. We use the ROUGE-L recall score [32] to measure the relevance between the
model’s predictions and the ground truth answers. For unlearning efficacy, lower scores are better.
To rigorously audit whether the model still retains the target knowledge, we employ membership
inference attacks (MIAs) [53; 12; 55], which have been used for privacy auditing and investigating
copyright violations. MIAs attempt to infer whether a particular input is a member of the model’s
training data. We collect some knowledge fragments about the unlearning target as the forget member
set (FM). For comparison, we also sample some unrelated knowledge fragments as the retain member
set (RM). We provide four MIA methods, including LOSS [65], Zlib Entropy [10], Min-K% Prob
[53] and Min-K%++ Prob [69] in RWKU. In our experiments, we primarily report the LOSS scores.
Higher scores indicate a lower likelihood that the model retains the specific knowledge. Therefore, a
well-learned model should exhibit significantly higher LOSS scores on the FM compared to the RM.
Knowledge Manipulation. We adopt question-answer style probes (QA) to assess the ability of the
unlearned model to utilize knowledge in practical applications. We construct questions by paraphras-
ing and restructuring knowledge fragments related to the unlearning targets. Meanwhile, malicious
users may use jailbreak techniques [38] to bypass restrictions and access forgotten knowledge. We
should consider more rigorous adversarial attack probes (AA) when evaluating unlearning efficacy.
Therefore, we carefully design nine types of adversarial attacks, which are detailed as follows:
(1) Prefix Injection: Adding some requests or commands before the question to instruct the
model to answer the question;
(2) Affirmative Suffix: Adding affirmative phrases after the question to elicit positive answers;
(3) Role Playing: Letting the model play specific roles, such as experts, historians and scientists;
(4) Multiple Choice: Letting the model choose from multiple options rather than answer;
(5) Reverse Query: Querying the unlearning target based on target-related information, ensur-
ing that the answer is the target itself;
6

(6) Synonym Manipulation: Using synonyms to replace key terms related to the target or other
entities in the question, such as aliases for people and abbreviations for places;
(7) Background Hint: Adding some target-related background information before the question;
(8) In-context Learning: Adding a question-answer pair related to the target before the question
to guide the model to answer;
(9) Cross Lingual: Asking the question in other languages, including French, German, Spanish.
We provide additional data examples in Appendix E.2. For both QA and AA probes, we also use the
ROUGE-L recall score for evaluation. Lower scores are better for evaluating unlearning efficacy.
3.3.2 Retain Assessment.
When evaluating the unlearned model, we should also consider the side effects on the model’s original
capabilities. We conduct the retain assessment from two perspectives: (1) Locality: The unlearning
process should be precise, without exceeding the boundaries of the target knowledge and perturbing
the surrounding neighboring knowledge. (2) Model Utility: Beyond neighboring knowledge, the
model’s performance on various real-world applications should not be impacted.
Neighbor Perturbation. We define neighboring knowledge in the unlearning task as that which is
closely related to, but not entirely contained within the scope of the unlearning targets. For example,
when the target is “ Forgetting Stephen King”, the model should forget “ Who the author of ‘The
Shining’ is”, but not forget “Who plays the character Jack Torrance in the film ‘The Shining’?” We
assess the neighbor perturbation based on knowledge memorization and manipulation. For evaluating
unlearning locality, higher scores are better.
Model Utility. We assess the model utility on various capabilities, which are detailed as follows:
(1) General Ability (Gen): We use MMLU [20], which consists of multiple-choice questions
from various branches of knowledge. We report 5-shot accuracy based on answer perplexity;
(2) Reasoning Ability (Rea) : We use Big-Bench-Hard (BBH) [ 57] with 27 subtasks. The
evaluation uses chain-of-thought prompts with 3-shot examples, and EM scores are reported;
(3) Truthfulness (Tru): To evaluate whether the model becomes dishonest after unlearning, we
use the TruthfulQA’s MC1 task [33], and 6-shot accuracy scores are reported;
(4) Factuality (Fac): Considering unlearning negates the original knowledge acquired by the
model, we evaluate the factuality on TriviaQA [27] with 6-shot, and F1 scores are reported;
(5) Fluency (Flu): To measure the generation quality of models, we adopt the instructions in
AlpacaEval [31], and report the weighted average of bi- and tri-gram entropies [71; 42].
For all the above datasets, higher scores are better. For better reproducibility, we provide detailed
evaluation prompts and dataset statistics in Appendix F.1 and F.2.
4 Experimental Setup
4.1 Model and Data Preparation
We conduct unlearning experiments on LLaMA3-Instruct (8B) and Phi-3 Mini-4K-Instruct (3.8B). As
shown in Table 8, we also report the original performance of LLaMA2-Chat (7B) and Mistral-Instruct-
v0.2 (7B) for reference. Because most existing unlearning methods for LLMs rely on fine-tuning
with the forget corpus Cf , they may not be directly applicable to our novel task setting. To address
this, we propose a simple and effective solution for this novel task setting. Specifically, we prompt
the original model to generate text descriptions related to the unlearning targets, which can serve as
the synthetic forget corpus Cs
f . The specific prompt and generated data examples are presented in
Appendix G.1 and G.3. For comparison, we also provide the text descriptions from the corresponding
Wikipedia pages of each unlearning target as the pseudo ground-truth forget corpus C∗
f .
4.2 Baseline Methods
(1) In-Context Unlearning (ICU) [47]: We use specific instructions to make the model behave
as if it has forgotten the target knowledge, without actually modifying the model parameters.
7

(2) Representation Engineering (RepE)[74; 30]: We provide the model with expert and novice
keywords as prompts, respectively, and then store the model’s hidden states. Subsequently,
we calculate the unlearning control vector, which represents the absence of target knowledge.
We use it to control the model’s activation space during the inference process.
(3) Gradient Ascent (GA)[25]: In contrast to the gradient descent during the pre-training phase,
we maximize the negative log-likelihood loss on the forget corpus. This approach aims to
steer the model away from its initial predictions, facilitating the process of unlearning.
(4) Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) [50]: We apply preference optimization to enable
the model to generate incorrect target knowledge. DPO requires positive and negative
examples to train the model. For the positive example, we sample it from the counterfactual
corpus Cc
f , which consists of intentionally fabricated descriptions generated by the model
about the target. For the negative example, we sample it from the synthetic forget corpus Cs
f .
(5) Negative Preference Optimization (NPO)[70]: NPO is a simple drop-in fix of the GA loss.
Compared to DPO, NPO retains only the negative examples without any positive examples.
(6) Rejection Tuning (RT)[39]: First, we have the model generate some questions related to
the unlearning targets, then replace its responses with “I do not know the answer.”. Then, we
use this refusal data to fine-tune the model so that it can reject questions related to the target.
We train the models using three approaches: full fine-tuning, partial-layer fine-tuning and LoRA [21].
The main experiment adopts the single-target unlearning setting, where one target is forgotten at a
time, and the results are averaged over 100 unlearning targets. We provide all the implementation
details and hyper-parameter settings in Appendix H.

5 Results
Overall Results. Table 1 and Table 7 present the main experimental results of various unlearning
methods on LLaMA3 and Phi-3, respectively. We can find the following conclusions: (1) Compared
to question-answer probes, models after unlearning is more susceptible to fill-in-the-blank probes
and adversarial-attack probes. It implies that although the unlearned model (especially after RT)
may forget how to utilize the knowledge, it can still be detected through knowledge memorization
probes. Besides, this also demonstrates the effectiveness of our carefully designed adversarial attacks
in eliciting seemingly forgotten knowledge from the unlearned model. (2) The method achieves
even greater unlearning efficiency when fine-tuned on the synthetic forget corpus Cs
f compared to
the pseudo ground-truth forget corpus C∗
f . This may be because, while C∗
f encompasses a broader
spectrum of knowledge about the target, it also includes a significant amount of irrelevant knowledge.
Conversely,Cs
f , generated by the original model itself, is likely more aligned with the model’s internal
memory. (3) Nevertheless, almost all methods trained on Cs
f fail under MIA, indicating a need for
more robust unlearning methods. (4) Compared to full fine-tuning, LoRA unlearns less (on the forget
set) and forgets less (on the retain set), consistent with recent findings on continued pretraining [6].
8

(5) Among all the baseline methods, ICU achieves the best results on LLaMA3, while it has almost
no effect on Phi-3, depending on the model’s ability to follow instructions. For those methods that
change the model parameters, the classic GA and the recent NPO perform relatively well. These
findings highlight the need for further research on unlearning methods.

Figure 3: Trade off between unlearning efficacy, lo-
cality and model utility of LLaMA3-Instruct (8B).
Trade Off. We show the trade-off between
unlearning efficacy, locality and model utility
in Figure 3 (where trainable methods sample
different training epochs and RepE samples dif-
ferent intervention weights). A good unlearning
method should be a straight line down from the
top right to the bottom right. We can observe
the following phenomenon: (1) It is challenging
to balance the unlearning efficacy and locality.
While unlearning the target knowledge, there
are also side effects on neighboring knowledge,
even with ICU which does not require training.
(2) Meanwhile, unlearning can also affect model
utility. For example, DPO rewards the model for
fabricating relevant information about the tar-
get knowledge, which encourages the model to
generate hallucinations, thereby significantly af-
fecting factuality and truthfulness. RT requires
the model to simply respond with “I don’t know"
during training, which may affect the model’s
generative capability.
Adversarial Attack Types. Figure 4 illustrates the effectiveness of different types of adversarial
attacks in inducing target knowledge from the model after forgetting. We can observe that prefix
injection, affirmative suffix, multiple choice and reverse query attacks effectively elicit unlearned
knowledge from the model. Because RT is fine-tuned on refusal data, it achieves the best unlearning
efficiency under adversarial attacks. NPO also demonstrates the potential to resist adversarial attacks.

Figure 4: Comparison of different adversarial attack types on LLaMA3-Instruct (8B).
Batch-target Unlearning. We also explore a particularly challenging unlearning scenario, involving
the forgetting of multiple targets simultaneously. As illustrated in Figure 5, we conduct batch-
unlearning experiments with target sizes of 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50. We can observe that the unlearning
methods exhibit three phenomena: (1) DPO and NPO fail to complete unlearning while maintaining
the original performance on the forget set and the retain set. (2) GA starts to lead to model collapse
when the target size equals 30. (3) RT, as a variant of instruction tuning, can complete the unlearning
task more stably and will not have a significant impact on neighbor knowledge.

Partial-layer Unlearning. We conduct an interesting experiment to verify that updating the param-
eters in which layers can achieve more effective unlearning. We choose to fine-tune four consecutive
layers of LLaMA3 (e.g., layers 0-3) and then freeze the remaining layers (e.g., layers 4-32). As shown
in Figure 7, we can observe a phenomenon: fine-tuning the early layers leads to better unlearning
effects without affecting neighbor knowledge. One possible explanation is that unlearning in the
early layers may involve twisting the meanings of keywords related to the forgetting target. Another
possible explanation is that the early layers store more factual knowledge [42; 16]. The localization of
the unlearning target knowledge is also a fascinating problem. If only a specific few parameters need
to be updated in the model to achieve unlearning, it could greatly preserve the original capabilities.
Case Study We conduct a case study on the forgetting effects of unlearning methods. As shown in
Appendix J, we can observe that ICU and RT methods usually lead the model to refuse to answer,
while GA, DPO and NPO incline the model towards providing an erroneous answer as an alternative.
6 Conclusion and Future Work
In this paper, we propose a Real-World Knowledge Unlearning benchmark ( RWKU) for LLM
unlearning. RWKU is designed based on the following three key factors: (1) For the task setting,
we consider a more practical and challenging unlearning setting. (2) For the knowledge source, we
choose 200 real-world famous people as the unlearning targets. (3) For the evaluation framework,
we provide membership inference attacks and adversarial attack probes to rigorously test unlearning
efficacy. We also assess locality and utility in terms of neighbor perturbation, general ability, reasoning
ability, truthfulness, factuality, and fluency. In the future, we plan to diversify knowledge sources (e.g.,
event knowledge and concept knowledge), incorporate more attack methods (e.g., gradient-based
attacks), and adopt more comprehensive evaluation metrics (e.g., balancing efficacy and locality).

A Datasheets for Real-World Knowledge Unlearning Benchmark (RWKU)
A.1 Motivation
• For what purpose was the dataset created? Was there a specific task in mind? Was
there a specific gap that needed to be filled? Please provide a description.
RWKU is a real-world knowledge unlearning benchmark specifically designed for large
language models (LLMs). RWKU is designed based on the following three key factors:
(1) For the task setting, we consider a more practical and challenging setting, similar to
“zero-shot knowledge unlearning”. We provide only the unlearning target and the original
model, without offering any forget corpus or retain corpus. In this way, it avoids secondary
information leakage caused by the forget corpus and is not affected by the distribution bias
of the retain corpus.
(2) For the knowledge source, we choose real-world famous people from Wikipedia as
the unlearning targets and demonstrate that such popular knowledge is widely present in
various LLMs through memorization quantification, making it more suitable for knowledge
unlearning. Additionally, choosing entities as unlearning targets can well clearly define the
unlearning boundaries.
(3) For the evaluation framework, we carefully design the forget set and the retain set
to evaluate the model’s capabilities from multiple real-world applications. Regarding
the forget set, we evaluate the efficacy of knowledge unlearning at both the knowledge
memorization (fill-in-the-blank style) and knowledge manipulation (question-answer style)
abilities. Specifically, we also evaluate these two abilities through adversarial attacks to
induce forgotten knowledge in the model. We adopt four membership inference attack
(MIA) methods for knowledge memorization on our collected MIA set. We meticulously
designed nine types of adversarial-attack probes for knowledge manipulation, including
prefix injection, affirmative suffix, role playing, reverse query, and others. Regarding the
retain set, we design a neighbor set to test the impact of neighbor perturbation, specifically
focusing on the locality of unlearning. In addition, we assess the model utility on various
capabilities, including general ability, reasoning ability, truthfulness, factuality, and fluency.
• Who created the dataset (e.g., which team, research group) and on behalf of which
entity (e.g., company, institution, organization)?
The author team created the dataset.
A.2 Composition
• What do the instances that comprise the dataset represent (e.g., documents, photos,
people, countries)? Are there multiple types of instances (e.g., movies, users, and ratings;
people and interactions between them; nodes and edges)? Please provide a description.
We select 200 famous people from The Most Famous All-time People Rank as our unlearning
targets.
• How many instances are there in total (of each type, if appropriate)?
RWKU mainly consists of four subsets, including the forget set, the neighbor set, the MIA
set, and the utility set. The forget set, the neighbor set, and the MIA set are constructed in
this paper. We list the dataset snapshot below:
Table 2: Dataset snapshot of RWKU benchmark.

• Does the dataset contain all possible instances or is it a sample (not necessarily random)
of instances from a larger set? If the dataset is a sample, then what is the larger set? Is the
sample representative of the larger set (e.g., geographic coverage)? If so, please describe
how this representativeness was validated/verified. If it is not representative of the larger set,
please describe why not (e.g., to cover a more diverse range of instances, because instances
were withheld or unavailable).
We sample the utility set from several widely used datasets. For an unlearning target, we
sample 171 instances from MMLU [20], 81 instances from BBH [57], 50 instances from
TruthfulQA [33], 100 instances from TriviaQA [27], 50 instances from AlpacaEval [31].
• What data does each instance consist of? “Raw” data (e.g., unprocessed text or images)
or features? In either case, please provide a description.
Our dataset adopts the widely used json format, which can be easily read. Please refer to the
data examples provided in the paper.
• Is there a label or target associated with each instance?If so, please provide a description.
Yes. Each query has its corresponding answer.
• Is any information missing from individual instances? If so, please provide a description,
explaining why this information is missing (e.g., because it was unavailable). This does not
include intentionally removed information, but might include, e.g., redacted text.
No.
• Are there recommended data splits (e.g., training, development/validation, testing)? If
so, please provide a description of these splits, explaining the rationale behind them.
Yes. Our dataset only consists of testing sets.
• Does the dataset contain data that might be considered confidential (e.g., data that is
protected by legal privilege or by doctor–patient confidentiality, data that includes the
content of individuals’ non-public communications)? If so, please provide a description.
No. All information about these individuals is obtained from publicly available sources and
collected from Wikipedia, ensuring that no sensitive issues are involved. We ensure that
all data complies with relevant privacy laws and regulations, guaranteeing that no personal
privacy will be compromised during the academic research process.
• Does the dataset contain data that, if viewed directly, might be offensive, insulting,
threatening, or might otherwise cause anxiety? If so, please describe why.
No.
A.3 Collection Process
• How was the data associated with each instance acquired? Was the data directly ob-
servable (e.g., raw text, movie ratings), reported by subjects (e.g., survey responses), or
indirectly inferred/derived from other data (e.g., part-of-speech tags, model-based guesses
for age or language)? If the data was reported by subjects or indirectly inferred/derived from
other data, was the data validated/verified? If so, please describe how.
All the forget and neighbor probes are generated by GPT-4.
• What mechanisms or procedures were used to collect the data (e.g., hardware appara-
tuses or sensors, manual human curation, software programs, software APIs)? How
were these mechanisms or procedures validated?
To construct the probes, we first use GPT-4 API with temperature = 1 to generate an excess
of query-answer pairs related to the unlearning targets. Then, we filter these queries using
mainstream open-source models to ensure that the knowledge is already present in these
models. Finally, we manually check these probes to ensure their format and type are correct.
The process of dataset collection is shown in Figure 6.
• If the dataset is a sample from a larger set, what was the sampling strategy (e.g.,
deterministic, probabilistic with specific sampling probabilities)?
We adopt the random sampling strategy.
• Who was involved in the data collection process (e.g., students, crowdworkers, contrac-
tors) and how were they compensated (e.g., how much were crowdworkers paid)?
Students.

C Broader Discussion
C.1 Limitation
The major limitation of RWKU is that it relies on a single knowledge source, selecting only real-world
famous people as the unlearning targets. The reason we selected entities as the targets for unlearning
is because their associated factual knowledge has garnered significant attention and exploration in
current research, especially in fields like knowledge probing and knowledge editing. Our main focus
is to introduce a novel perspective for LLM knowledge unlearning and to provide a comprehensive
evaluation framework to aid in the development of unlearning methods. Currently, we are also striving
to diversify the knowledge sources of our unlearning targets. We have collected 100 real-world
historical events as unlearning targets, and these will be open-sourced in the future. Additionally, we
plan to explore using conceptual knowledge and rule-based knowledge as unlearning targets.
C.2 Potential Impact and Ethics Statement
In this paper, we choose 200 famous people as the unlearning targets and construct multi-level
knowledge probes to evaluate the model’s memory retention of knowledge. The information about
the famous people involved in RWKU is widely available and publicly accessible on Wikipedia, thus
RWKU does not raise any privacy concerns. Furthermore, the primary aim of our study is to unlearn
specific knowledge, which can effectively eradicate sensitive information, copyrighted data, and
potentially harmful capabilities within LLMs. In addition, we design adversarial attack probes to
evaluate the robustness of the model after unlearning. We have also taken into account the potential
side effects of unlearning. Our aspiration is that RWKU will advance the field of LLM unlearning
methods, thereby addressing the ethical concerns surrounding LLMs.

[System]
Your goal is to generate a set of questions and answers to assess the
model’s knowledge retention after unlearning related targets. Based
on the given target, its related neighbor and the text of the
neighbor, create a list of questions about the neighbor. Level 1
should be based on the cloze test format (using the underline "___"
as the mask), extracting some fragments from the original text to
test the model’s memory ability regarding the training data. Note
that these clozes should focus on the neighbor and must not involve
the target. They mainly examine the model’s ability to remember
neighbor information. Note that the questions should be unambiguous
and factually correct. Please avoid generating enumeration, open-
ended or non-factual questions. You should also provide the correct
answer, and the answers to the questions must be unique. You should
also provide the specific tag to indicate the question type. The
answer MUST be short phrases rather than a full sentence. Your
response should follow this JSON format.

developed a passion for writing at an early age, encouraged
by his mother, a avid reader and writer herself. He began

while still in high school. After graduating from the
University of Maine in 1970 with a Bachelor of Arts in
English, King taught high school English before deciding to
focus on his writing full-time. In 1971, he moved to southern
Maine with his wife, Tabitha Spruce, and began writing
novels and short stories in earnest. King’s breakthrough came
in 1973 with the publication of his horror novel, Carrie,
which was a huge success and established him as a major force
in the horror genre ... Today, Stephen King is widely
regarded as one of the most popular and influential authors
of his generation, with a vast and devoted fan base. He

H Implementation Details
H.1 Baseline Details
In-Context Unlearning (ICU). Inspired by the guardrail-based work [58], we provide the specific
prompt used by ICU:
You are an AI Assistant who is supposed to unlearn about {target} and
provide answers without its knowledge as if you never knew about it.
Don’t tell anyone that you unlearned anything.
Representation Engineering (RepE). Following previous work [74; 30], we compute the unlearn-
ing control vector hcontrol as: hcontrol = gθ(pnovice)−gθ(pexpert), where the novice templatepnovice
denotes:
{intro} You don’t know {target} at all.
Please feel free to fabricate information about {target}.
The expert template pexpert denotes:
{intro} You know {target} very well.
Please provide accurate information about {target}.
We set the intervention strength α of the control vector to {0.5, 1.0, 1.5}.
Gradient Ascent (GA). We maximize the original log-likelihood loss used in causal language
modelling, which is equivalent to minimizing the following loss:
LGA = Ex∼C [log πθ (x)] , (1)
where πθ is the model in the unlearning process.
Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Given a preference pair (yw, yl) with the input x, where
yw is a counterfactual description of the target, yl is a factual description of the target. We aim to
enable the model to generate incorrect knowledge about the unlearning target via the following loss:
LDPO = −E(x,yw,yl)∼C

log σ

β log πθ (yw | x)
πref (yw | x) −β log πθ (yl | x)
πref (yl | x)

, (2)
where πθ is the model in the unlearning process,σ is sigmoid function andβ is a parameter controlling
the deviation from the original model πref.
Negative Preference Optimization (NPO). Compared to DPO, we ignore the yw term in DPO and
obtain the NPO loss:
LNPO = −E(x,yl)∼C

log σ

−β log πθ (yl | x)
πref (yl | x)

, (3)
where πθ is the model in the unlearning process,σ is sigmoid function andβ is a parameter controlling
the deviation from the original model πref.
Rejection Tuning (RT). We obtain 100 rejection templates from TOFU [39]. We minimize the
original log-likelihood loss:
LRT = −Ex∼C [log πθ (x)] , (4)
43

H.2 Hyper-parameter Settings
In the main experiment, we adopt the single-target unlearning setting, where one target is forgotten
at a time, and the results are averaged over 100 unlearning targets. We conduct experiments on
LLaMA3-Instruct (8B) and Phi-3 Mini-4K-Instruct (3.8B). For all methods trained on synthetic
forget corpus, we set the number of training epochs to 3. For the GA method trained on the pseudo
ground-truth forget corpus, we set the number of training epochs to 4, considering its relatively
small size. Due to varying learning rate requirements for different methods, we select the learning
rate for each method via grid search in the range of 1e−8 to 1e−5. We use AdamW with 20 step
warm-up during training. We typically set the learning rate of LoRA to be ten times higher for the full
fine-tuning. LoRA rank is set to 8 and LoRA alpha is set to 16. For the batch-target unlearning setting,
we conduct experiments with target sizes of 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50. We set the number of training
epochs to 2 for all methods. Compared to single-target unlearning, we set relatively smaller learning
rates for each method to avoid model collapse. All experiments are conducted with eight A100 GPUs.
For more implementation details please refer to https://github.com/jinzhuoran/RWKU.

J Case Study
We conduct a case study on the forgetting effects of various unlearning methods (including ICU,
RepE, GA, DPO, NPO, and RT) on LLaMA3-Instruct (8B). As shown in Tables 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 and
14, we can observe that ICU and RT methods usually lead the model to refuse to answer, while GA,
DPO and NPO incline the model towards providing an erroneous answer as an alternative.
