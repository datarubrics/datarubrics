Abstract
The latest research on wildfire forecast and backtracking has adopted AI models,
which require a large amount of data from wildfire scenarios to capture fire spread
patterns. This paper explores using cost-effective simulated wildfire scenarios to
train AI models and apply them to the analysis of real-world wildfire. This solution
requires AI models to minimize the Sim2Real gap, a brand-new topic in the fire
spread analysis research community. To investigate the possibility of minimizing
the Sim2Real gap, we collect the Sim2Real-Fire dataset that contains 1M simulated
scenarios with multi-modal environmental information for training AI models.
We prepare 1K real-world wildfire scenarios for testing the AI models. We also
propose a deep transformer, S2R-FireTr, which excels in considering the multi-
modal environmental information for forecasting and backtracking the wildfire.
S2R-FireTr surpasses state-of-the-art methods in real-world wildfire scenarios.
1 Introduction
The frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, such as high temperatures and droughts,
have escalated. This escalation has increased the frequency and scale of forest fires, rendering
fire extinguishing a formidable challenge. An accurate and real-time forest fire spread forecast is
imperative for organizing evacuations and commanding rescue operations. On the other hand, forest
fire backtracking helps identify high-risk ignition areas, assisting people in preventing potential fires.
Extensive studies have been conducted on forest fire spread forecast and backtracking. These studies
have given rise to three categories of methods based on the empirical, physical, or artificial intelligence
(AI) models. The empirical models [1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6; 7] only capture the statistical correlation between
observed fire data in real-world or the energy conservation, without considering the impact of physical
rules like the conductive, convective, and radiative modes of heat transfer on the fire spread. The
physical models [8; 9; 10; 11; 12] rely on the approximate physical rules, including the fluid dynamics,
combustion, and heat transfer, to forecast the forest fire spread. Furthermore, they also consider the
impact of environmental information about vegetation, atmosphere, and topography on fire spread.
The research on the empirical and physical models leads to the emergence of an array of simulators
of forest fire spread like BehavePlus [ 13], FARSITE [1], FIRETEC [14], WRF-SFIRE [12], and

WFDS [9]. Given the environmental details and the current fire area, a simulator can predict the
spread area at any moment. This is also known as the simulation process. However, the existing
simulators fall short of utilizing the historical multi-modal data (e.g., satellite-view images of forest
and spreading fire areas) of fire progression to forecast the future areas of fire spreading. These
simulators also lack backtracking capability, which traces earlier fire states.
AI models [15; 16; 17; 18; 19; 20; 21; 22; 23; 24; 25; 26; 27; 28; 29; 30] can better leverage the
history of fire data to forecast and backtrack the spread of forest fire. Mainly, AI models based
on the deep neural networks [20; 24; 25; 28; 29; 30] perform excellently in forest fire forecast and
backtracking. These models learn the spreading patterns of forest fire from a large amount of data
about the temporal change of the environmental factors and forest fire areas. The environmental
data and the wildfire images are usually captured by remote sensing satellites from real-world
forests. They form the multi-modal data that requires significant labor costs for data collection and
annotation for model training. Moreover, the satellites orbit the Earth rapidly, without continuously
observing a particular forest fire area. During the period without observation by any satellite, the
environmental and fire data are unavailable, contributing to the difficulty of using real-world data
for model training. Though the Gazer satellite can provide temporally complete data, it makes data
collection extraordinarily expensive. Therefore, collecting large-scale and temporally complete data
at a low cost is critical.
The simulation process based on the empirical and physical models can be done quickly without
needing substantial human effort for data collection and annotation. The natural idea is to use the data
generated by the simulator, in chronological or reverse order, to train the forecasting or backtracking
model primarily based on the data-hungry deep network. Given the multi-modal environmental
data of vegetation, atmosphere, and topography, the simulator can generate data on wildfire areas
that change over time. This effectively addresses the problem of missing data due to intermittent
observation by satellite. Besides, people can let the forest fire start at any possible position in the
simulated environment, producing diverse fire-spreading data for model training.
The above manner takes advantage of the empirical, physical, and AI models, using large-scale
simulation data to train the AI-based forecast and backtracking models. However, this manner faces
two problems relevant to the Sim2Real gap. First, as the simulator employs approximate physical
rules to generate simulation data, it introduces simulation errors, resulting in the Sim2Real gap
between simulated and real data. Second, different simulators predict fire changes based on empirical
or physical models. Even with the same environmental conditions, these simulators may yield vastly
different prediction results, further exacerbating the Sim2Real gap. Natural forests’ exceptionally
complex climate and terrain environments make it infeasible to verify whether the results obtained
by different simulators are reliable. This further makes it challenging to eliminate erroneous fire
simulation data. The incorrect simulation results introduce significant noise into model training.
We promote research on minimizing the Sim2Real gap and utilizing the simulation data to train AI
models for the spread forecast and backtracking of wildfires in real-world forests. We collect the
Sim2Real-Fire dataset that contains 1M virtual wildfire scenarios. These scenarios are produced
by widely-used simulators, FARSITE [ 1], WFDS [ 9], and WRF-SFIRE [ 31]. We prepare the
environmental data of vegetation, fuel, topography, weather, and fire areas for each scenario. These
data are in the multi-modal format captured from the satellite’s view. Sim2Real-Fire provides large-
scale data for training the AI-based forecast and backtracking models. We collect 1K worldwide
scenarios of wildfire in the natural forest. We select these real scenarios from publicly available
satellite data. Compared to the existing datasets [ 19; 32; 33; 34; 35; 36], Sim2Real-Fire provides
more large-scale and challenging data for testing the Sim2Real performances of AI models.
We also contribute a Sim2Real model, S2R-FireTr, based on a deep transformer network inspired by
semantic segmentation methods [37; 38], for forest fire spread forecast and backtracking. We train
S2R-FireTr on the simulation data. S2R-FireTr comprehensively captures the correlation between
multi-modal data to alleviate the Sim2Real gap in network training. Moreover, S2R-FireTr can be
trained on temporally incomplete data to enhance its forecast and backtracking capacities during
testing on real-world data. We evaluate S2R-FireTr on the new Sim2Real-Fire dataset, surpassing the
performances of state-of-the-art methods.

2 Sim2Real-Fire Dataset
The Sim2Real-Fire dataset contains wildfire simulation and real-world data. The set includes 1M
and 1K wildfire scenarios. Each scenario is associated with five data modalities of environmental
information, including topography, vegetation, fuel maps, weather data, and satellite images with the
annotated fire regions. We align these modalities spatially and temporally.
2.1 Data Modalities of Environmental Information
Figure 1 shows examples of topography, vegetation, fuel, weather, and satellite data.
Topography Map We follow the format of LANDFIRE [39] to make the topography map. Each
topography map describes the landscape of a region of the United States, Canada, or Mexico from
2013 to 2023. It can be divided into three channels: landscape aspect, elevation, and slope. Aspect is
the azimuth of sloping surfaces across a landscape. The elevation is the land elevation (meters) above
mean sea level. The slope is the change in elevation over a specific area.
Vegetation Map We follow LANDFIRE to collect the vegetation map. Each vegetation map
consists of the channels of existing vegetation type (EVT), existing vegetation cover (EVC), existing
vegetation height (EVH), and existing vegetation type national vegetation classification(EVTNVC).
EVT provides the classification of about 700 types of plants. EVC represents the vertical projection
of a region’s percent live canopy cover. EVH is the average height of the dominant vegetation.
EVTNVC is an existing vegetation-type layer representing the distribution of vegetation groups based
on the USNVC classification.
Fuel Map The fuel map has four channels: surface fuel (SF), canopy fuel (CF), fuel disturbance
(FD), and fuel vegetation (FV). SF represents the fuel distribution of sizes and types. CF contains
information about forest canopy cover, height, and density. FD integrates the individual disturbance
of the burnable vegetation for modeling the fuel transition. FV is an adapted depiction of vegetation
for converting continuous vegetation values into the fuel model.
Weather Data The weather data is tabular, collected from the Remote Automatic Weather Sta-
tion [40]. Each table of weather data contains the temperature, relative humidity, precipitation, wind
speed, wind direction, and cloud cover, which are recorded in the hourly sequence.
3

Satellite Images We use the satellite image sequences of the fire regions, which are captured
by Landsat-8 [41] and Sentinel-2 [ 42] satellites. Landsat-8 carries the Operational Land Imager
and Thermal Infrared Sensor, orbiting the Earth every 99 minutes with a revisit period of 16 days.
Sentinel-2 consists of 2A and 2B, with a revisit period of 10 and 5 days, respectively. Each image has
the mask annotation of the fire regions.
2.2 Simulation Data
We use the simulation data to train and test the forecast and backtracking models. We prepare 1M
virtual wildfire scenarios, each with five data modalities. The satellite image sequence of each
scenario contains about 100 frames of fire spread. We divide these simulation data by 80%/20%
to form the training and testing sets. Below, we introduce how to use the wildfire simulators (i.e.,
FARSITE [1], WFDS [9], and WRF-SFIRE [31]) to produce the virtual scenarios.
Simulators FARSITE relies on the empirical model to simulate wildfires. The input to FARSITE
consists of the topography, vegetation maps, and weather data. Given the above three modalities
of environmental information, FARSITE simulates the fire spread represented by a sequence of
mask annotations. We fuse the mask annotations of fire regions with the satellite images, thus
approximating real-world fire regions with changing boundaries.
WFDS combines numerical methods and physical models to simulate wildfires. It allows tuning the
speed and scope of fire spread by controllable parameters. WFDS can produce satellite images with
fire regions and smoke, which show realism like real-world images.
Like WFDS, WRF-SFIRE takes input as the simulation process’s topography, fuel maps, and weather
data. It outputs detailed information on fire dynamics, including the rate of spread, fire intensity, and
spatial extent hourly. Unlike FARSITE and WFDS, which assume the weather data are independent
of the fire spread, WRF-SFIRE yields weather data that may be significantly affected by the fire
spread, thus facilitating the analysis of fire-weather interactions.
Simulated Masks of Fire RegionsThe simulator outputs a sequence of binary masks to represent
the change of fire regions in each virtual scenario. To enrich the simulation data, we randomly jitter
the initial location of the wildfire and other controllable parameters (e.g., the speed and scope of fire
spread). Given an identical set of multi-modality environmental data (i.e., topography, vegetation,
fuel maps, weather data, and satellite images), we employ the simulator with the jittered parameters
to produce about 200 discrepant sequences of mask annotations.
2.3 Real-world Data
Apart from the masks of fire regions produced by the simulators, we collect 1K real-world wildfire
scenarios from the satellite images. We recruit a group of human annotators to identify and label the
fire regions. Each real-world scenario also has five modalities of environmental information. Each
sequence has 2-10 satellite images. The real-world scenarios are used for model testing.
Data Selection We select the satellite images collected by Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2, fuse the images
of different wavebands, and eliminate the images without clearly observing the fire regions due to
dense clouds or smoke occlusion. We keep the spatial resolution of these fused images to 30 meters to
capture landscapes on the Earth. We convert the fused images into tones close to real images through
pseudo-colorization.
Data Annotation We import the fused satellite images into ArcGIS [43], allowing human annotators
to label the binary masks of the wildfire regions. Each mask is a polygon. Each annotator uses
NV5 GEOSPATIAL software [44] to identify fire areas automatically. We recruit 20 annotators to
manage the labeling task. To guarantee the quality of the annotations, we require three annotators to
cross-check every binary mask. People need to refine a mask disapproved by three annotators.
2.4 Dataset Statistics and Comparison
We list the basic information of different datasets for wildfire analysis in Table 1. The Sim2Real-Fire
dataset contains 1M scenarios of wildfire spreading over the world. It provides five data modalities:
topography, vegetation, fuel, weather, and satellite data. We divide these data modalities into two
groups. The first group contains the topography, vegetation, fuel maps, and satellite images, which

provide the spatial information of the wildfire scenarios. The second group contains sequential
weather data and satellite images to capture the temporal dynamic of wildfire scenarios.
Compared to other datasets, Sim2Real-Fire offers richer environmental information across multiple
modalities. The satellite images in this dataset have a spatial resolution of less than 30 meters for
capturing wildfire scenarios, enabling more precise visualization of surrounding environments and
fire areas. A key advantage of our dataset is its multi-modal hybrid data encompassing both simulated
and real-life wildfire scenarios. The Sim2Real-Fire dataset is the first public dataset designed to
support training forest fire forecast and backtracking models on simulation data and testing them on
real-world data. The simulation data in this dataset was generated using various simulators (empirical,
numerical, and physical models) to produce diverse fire scenarios, addressing the limitations that
relying on a single simulator can introduce biases in model training.
Among the five modalities in the Sim2Real-Fire dataset, the vegetation and fuel maps provide the
category-wise data. The topography map and weather data contain numerical data, which can be
divided into several ranges. We report the proportions of the vegetation and fuel categories in
Figure 2(a–b). The topography and weather data ranges are shown in Figure 2(c–d).

Figure 3: S2R-FireTr forecasts wildfires by predicting future target fire areas based on source fire
areas. (a) During the environment-guided area representation learning, we input the source fire
areas and multi-modal environmental information into the transformer to compute the source area
presentation A. (b) During the time-wise fire area regression, we input the source area presentationA
and the target timestamp into the transformer to compute the target area presentation R for predicting
the target fire areas. “Shifted Later”means that we concatenate the source and target areas to predict
later areas. Source and target areas can be interchanged, creating a pipeline for wildfire backtracking.
H × W indicates the spatial resolution of each image. The translation outputs the target sequence
with T binary masks T ∈ RH×W×T of forest fire areas. T represents the historical or future
changes of the fire areas, temporally, in the forecast or backtracking task. We propose S2R-FireTr to
accomplish the above translation. As illustrated in Figure 3, S2R-FireTr consists of the modules of
Environment-guided Area Representation Learningand Time-wise Fire Area Regression.
Environment-guided Area Representation LearningThe first module of S2R-FireTr (Figure 3(a))
takes input as the source sequence of binary masks S ∈ RH×W×T , which represents the known areas
of forest fire within T timestamps. We employ the satellite images I ∈ RH×W×3×T , the topography,
vegetation, fuel maps P, G, F ∈ RH×W×C, and the weather W ∈ RC×T to learn the source area
representation A ∈ RH×W×C×T for the source sequence S. C indicates the channels.
We employ the dual cross-attention to learn the source area representation A. In Eq. (1), the dual
cross-attention considers the correlation between multi-modal data from the spatial and temporal
perspectives. We compute the query vector q ∈ RH×W×C×T based on the source sequence S. We
compute two sets of key and value vectors, kspatial, vspatial, ktemporal, vtemporal ∈ RH×W×C×T ,
based on the spatial and temporal information of the satellite image sequence I, the topography,
vegetation, fuel maps P, G, F, and the weather W as:
q = SwinEnc(S),
kspatial = SwinEnc([P, G, F, I]), vspatial = SwinEnc([P, G, F, I]),
ktemporal = [SwinEnc(I), MHA(W)], vtemporal = [SwinEnc(I), MHA(W)],
A = softmax(q · kspatial

where [·], SwinEnc, MHA and softmax denote the feature concatenation, the encoder of Swin

The above dual cross-attention comprehensively constructs the correlation between fire areas and
multi-modal spatial-temporal data. During network training, despite the Sim2Real gap between fire
areas of the simulation and real situations, the dual cross-attention can still rely on the correlation
between multi-modal data to learn fire area representations that are more consistent with the natural
environment. It thereby reduces the negative impact of the Sim2Real gap on network training.
Time-wise Fire Area RegressionBased on the source area representation A of the source sequence
S, we use the second module of S2R-FireTr (Figure 3(b)) to compute the target area representation
R ∈ RH×W×C×T of the future/history fire areas. Based on the target area representation R, we
regress the target sequence T ∈ RH×W×T of the forest fire areas in the forecast/backtracking task.
We implement the area regression by a cross-attention. This module regards a set of timestamps
[p(1), ..., p(T)] as the query, the source area representation A as the key and value as:
q = pos([p(1), ..., p(T)]), k = conv(A), v = conv(A), R = softmax( q · k√
W × H ) · v, (2)
where q, k, v ∈ RH×W×C×T represent the query, key, and value vectors.pos means the positional
encoding. We remark that the timestamps [p(1), ..., p(t), ..., p(T)] in Eq. (2), which are used for
computing the query vector q, are unnecessarily continuous. p(t) is the timestamp of the tth frame.
This allows the model to be tested on real-world data, which may be temporally incomplete.
Given the target area representationR, we regress the target sequence of binary masksbT ∈ RH×W×T
as:
bT = SwinDec(R), L = ∥T − bT∥, (3)
where SwinDec means the decoder of Swin Transformer. During the model training phase, we
minimize the difference between the regressed sequences bT and the ground-truth sequences T.

performances on the simulation and real-world data. These
simulators are based on empirical and physical models and
work without a training process. They only rely on the multi-
modal environmental information to predict the fire spread
during the evaluation phase. We evaluate the performances of
these models in terms of AUPRC (Area Under the Precision-
Recall Curve), Intersection over Union (IOU), and F1-score.
We report each metric in percentage (%).

4.1 Performances of Various Models on Forecast and Backtracking Tasks
We compare S2R-FireTr with the commonly used AI models that can be easily adapted to the forecast
and backtracking tasks in Table 2. We train the AI models on the simulation data and test them on
the simulation and real-world data of Sim2Real-Fire. S2R-FireTr better constructs the correlation
between various modalities of data, thus achieving better performance than other methods.
In Table 3, we evaluate the simulators based on various empirical and physical models on the forecast
task. All simulators are assessed on the same real-world data set and given the same environmental
information for a fair comparison. S2R-FireTr remarkably outperforms all of the compared simulators
on the real-world data. This is because S2R-FireTr employs time-wise fire area regression to forecast
better fire areas based on temporally incomplete data in the real world. We provide the forecast and
backtracking results in Figure 4.

In Tables 4 and 6, we evaluate different
modalities of environmental information,
including topography (Topo.), vegetation
(Veg.), fuel (Fuel) maps, weather (Wea.),
and satellite image sequence (Sat.), on AI
models in the forecast and backtracking
tasks. This excludes each data modality
from the model training and testing. Com-
pared to the models with the complete set
of data modalities (Full), the absence of any
modality leads to the performance degra-
dation of all AI models, demonstrating the importance of each modality. We find that S2R-FireTr
outperforms other AI models in every case where a data modality is eliminated. It shows the
robustness of S2R-FireTr.
We also evaluate the impact of each data modality on the simulators (i.e., FARSITE [1], WFDS [9],
and WRF-SFIRE [12]) in the forecast task (see Table 5). Compared to all modalities utilized in
Tables 4, 5 and 6, the absence of each data modality results in a performance degradation of 2∼10%.
It means that all data provided in the Sim2Real-Fire dataset helps analyze wildfires. We remark that
the fuel map is the prerequisite for starting all simulators. Thus, we omit the comparison between the
simulations without the fuel map.
4.3 Ablation Study of S2R-FireTr
We remove one or more critical components of S2R-FireTr (i.e., Environment-guided Area Represen-
tation Learning and Time-wise Fire Area Regression) to study their effectiveness on the forecast and
backtracking tasks in Table 7. Compared to the entire model of S2R-FireTr, the alternatives without

these components, designed for learning correlation between multiple modalities of environmental
information from the temporally incomplete data, remarkably degrade the performances.
In Table 8, we further study the impact of the input and output length of the temporal data (i.e.,
weather and satellite images) on the performance of S2R-FireTr. Excessively long input and output
sequences degrade the performances. It demonstrates that forecasting and backtracking the long-term
wildfire areas are highly challenging tasks. On the other hand, we find that the performance of

S2R-FireTr within six frames is satisfactory. Given that the sequence length of fire areas in real-world
applications is relatively short, we consider the practicability of S2R-FireTr to be solid.
5 Conclusion
This paper introduces the Sim2Real-Fire dataset with 1M simulated scenarios and 1K realistic wildfire
scenarios for training and testing AI models that forecast and backtrack wildfires in the real world.
This dataset is meaningful for the Sim2Real investigation of wildfire forecast and backtracking.
Technically, we contribute a deep transformer, S2R-FireTr, trained on the simulated scenarios. S2R-
FireTr surpasses state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating the potential of minimizing the Sim2Real
gap between the simulated and realistic wildfire scenarios. The sim2Real-Fire dataset is limited as
it only includes wildfire scenarios from certain countries and periods due to the limited budget for
data acquisition in reality. This closed nature reduces the richness of the training data, limiting the
model’s ability to generalize to unknown environmental conditions. To address this, we advocate for
dynamic data acquisition methods to transform the dataset into an open resource. In the future, we
will extend our dataset and method to a broader range of wildfire analysis tasks, where we need to
transfer the fire spread patterns learned from the simulated scenarios to the real world. People can
access our dataset, a video detailing the dataset creation process, relevant documentation, and model
code via https://github.com/TJU-IDVLab/Sim2Real-Fire.
6 Broader Impacts
This paper has several potential positive societal impacts: the proposed Sim2Real-Fire dataset, a
multi-modal dataset with temporal data, is designed to facilitate deep learning models on the relevant
tasks for wildfire analysis. The proposed S2R-FireTr model provides a comprehensive understanding
of the multiple environmental factors influencing forecast and backtracking, thereby enhancing the
accuracy of wildfire prediction. This work has inconspicuous negative societal impacts.
