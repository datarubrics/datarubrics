Specifically, the FCA tool prepares subsets by extracting classes from full real-world image datasets such as ImageNet1K and others listed in Table 1. This process uses the original image data, which is human-generated and manually captured for those public vision datasets, as the raw data foundation. The few-class subsets are derived directly from these image datasets; hence, the modality is image and the data origin is human-generated, not model-generated or unknown. The paper explicitly emphasizes that FCA does not create new image data but subsets existing human-captured image datasets for few-class benchmarking."

These perturbations are generated using a content-level paraphrasing algorithm that uses a Large Language Model (LLM) rewriter (model generated) to restate original human-generated multiple-choice questions (human generated text) sentence-by-sentence to maintain the knowledge while altering irrelevant details, thus creating new test samples per original question. The resulting data consists of paraphrased question texts and variations with format-level perturbations (e.g., option permutations) applied algorithmically. Therefore, the new dataset is composed of text data that is both human generated originally and model generated during paraphrasing to create new knowledge-invariant perturbed question sets derived from original human-authored questions in the MMLU benchmark. These are introduced and described in Section 3.1 under 'Content-level perturbation: knowledge-invariant paraphrasing' and experimentally evaluated in Section 4. The data leveraged (MMLU subsets) are pre-existing, but the perturbed data samples introduced by PertEval are new dataset entries created by the authors. Hence, the new dataset introduced is text modality and has mixed human (original) and model-generated (rewritten perturbations) origin."

The paper presents recommendations for such consent-driven datasets (e.g., Casual Conversations v2 [254]) as example of new datasets collected consensually.

For stereotype bias, it details the designed user prompts with stereotypes over 24 demographic groups and 16 topics, with templates and demographic groups listed and discussed (Section 3 and D.1). For adversarial robustness, it uses the existing AdvGLUE dataset and extends it by generating AdvGLUE++ adversarial texts with specific attack methods on open-source models (Section 4 and E.1-E.2). For out-of-distribution robustness, it creates OOD data via style transformations, recent event QA, and OOD in-context demonstrations, described thoroughly (Section 5 and F). For adversarial demonstration robustness, specific demonstrations with counterfactuals, spurious correlations, and backdoors are designed and their generation methods described (Section 6 and G). For privacy evaluation, it uses the Enron Email dataset and constructs prompts for private information extraction, with detailed setups (Section 7 and H). Machine ethics evaluations use ETHICS and Jiminy Cricket datasets with prompt design explained (Section 8 and I). Fairness evaluations transform the Adult dataset into prompts with sensitive attribute controls, all described in detail (Section 9 and J). The dataset composition, collection, preprocessing, and labeling are explicitly mentioned in Appendix P.2.

Since medical imaging data are derived from human patients, the data are human-generated images captured via medical imaging devices.
