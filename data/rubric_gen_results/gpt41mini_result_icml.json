Atomic structures (nodes and edges) are generated using molecular dynamics simulations with 8000 atoms created via melting-quenching procedures. The energy barriers (EBs), which are regression labels for the nodes, are precisely computed using the Activation-Relaxation Technique nouveau (ARTn), a simulation method. Since the dataset consists of atomic graph structures derived from human-designed molecular dynamics simulations combined with computationally simulated energy barrier labels, the data modality is 'graph,' and the origin is both human generated (initial sample designs and simulations) and model generated (simulated via molecular dynamics and ARTn). This information is explicitly stated in Section 5.1 and Appendix A.5 describing dataset construction and simulation procedures."

The data modality is text because it consists of natural language instructions, model-generated textual completions, and GPT-4 generated textual critiques and scalar preference scores. The dataset is model generated, as the instructions are sampled from various existing high-quality public instruction datasets (which were human-generated originally but are used here as fixed instruction prompts), the completions are generated by a diverse pool of 17 language models (including GPT-4, ChatGPT, Bard, LLaMA variants, etc.), and the feedback annotations (ratings and textual critiques) are generated by GPT-4 itself automatically. There is no indication of new human annotation in the construction of this dataset; instead human-generated origin is only relevant to pre-existing datasets from which instructions are drawn but those instructions are treated as fixed inputs here. Thus, the dataset can be classified as text modality, with model generated origin for the completions, instructions are reused but fixed, and feedback annotations generated by GPT-4, yielding a scalable AI feedback dataset. This is confirmed in Sections 2.2 to 2.4 which describe the data collection pipeline, and in the Abstract and Section 2 summary describing the dataset content."

The paper describes that the trajectories are collected by running policies (random, medium, medium replay) in simulation, with observations including moving distractors. Since the data are collected by running policies in simulated environments and capturing image observations, it is image modality data. It is Human Generated because the trajectories are obtained from policy executions (non-expert or sub-optimal policies) in the environments, i.e., the dataset is collected by human-setup policy executions and environment rendering, not model-generated data.

The simulation of label shifts is done by manipulating label distributions via Dirichlet sampling with fixed source label distributions. No data is generated by models; all are human-generated image data collected in various settings, with simulated shifts created programmatically.

Since the audio is generated by convolving AudioSet sounds with room impulse responses simulated by SoundSpaces 2.0 in virtual environments, the data is model-generated (simulated) rather than human recorded. The text QA pairs are presumably generated programmatically based on ground truth spatial relations."

This synthetic LR dataset is generated by a conditional normalizing flow model trained on pairs of real HR and LR images, using latent space interpolation and additional constraints to generate realistic LR images matching complex degradations found in real-world images. The HR images are from the RealSR dataset (human-captured), and the LR images for unseen degradation levels are model-generated via InterFlow. The resulting paired data (HR and synthesized LR images) form a new dataset introduced by the authors to train SR networks. As images are originally captured by humans and the LR images are then model-generated by the proposed method, both 'Human Generated' and 'Model Generated' are true for the image modality.

The authors create semi-synthetic datasets (denoted as D'') by removing censored instances and then applying various synthetic censoring distributions algorithmically (uniform, exponential, original censoring-based, feature-dependent censoring, and external dataset censorship). Hence, the modality is tabular, the data is human-generated originally, but the censoring and thus final event censoring status and labels in the new datasets are model-generated via algorithmic simulation.

Given the dataset mix includes 3.64M episodes and some comes from simulation, the authors explicitly mention datasets from simulation and real-world collections. Overall, signal/sensor data comprises both human generated (real sensors) and model generated (simulated sensors) data."
