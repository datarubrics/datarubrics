Atomic structures (nodes and edges) are generated using molecular dynamics simulations with 8000 atoms created via melting-quenching procedures. The energy barriers (EBs), which are regression labels for the nodes, are precisely computed using the Activation-Relaxation Technique nouveau (ARTn), a simulation method. Since the dataset consists of atomic graph structures derived from human-designed molecular dynamics simulations combined with computationally simulated energy barrier labels, the data modality is 'graph,' and the origin is both human generated (initial sample designs and simulations) and model generated (simulated via molecular dynamics and ARTn). This information is explicitly stated in Section 5.1 and Appendix A.5 describing dataset construction and simulation procedures."

The data modality is text because it consists of natural language instructions, model-generated textual completions, and GPT-4 generated textual critiques and scalar preference scores. The dataset is model generated, as the instructions are sampled from various existing high-quality public instruction datasets (which were human-generated originally but are used here as fixed instruction prompts), the completions are generated by a diverse pool of 17 language models (including GPT-4, ChatGPT, Bard, LLaMA variants, etc.), and the feedback annotations (ratings and textual critiques) are generated by GPT-4 itself automatically. There is no indication of new human annotation in the construction of this dataset; instead human-generated origin is only relevant to pre-existing datasets from which instructions are drawn but those instructions are treated as fixed inputs here. Thus, the dataset can be classified as text modality, with model generated origin for the completions, instructions are reused but fixed, and feedback annotations generated by GPT-4, yielding a scalable AI feedback dataset. This is confirmed in Sections 2.2 to 2.4 which describe the data collection pipeline, and in the Abstract and Section 2 summary describing the dataset content."

The dataset captures physical variables such as temperature, flue gas concentration, and velocity over time measured at multiple sensor nodes positioned in 3D spatial domains (tunnel fires and pool fires). Thus, the data modality is time series from sensors measuring dynamical physical quantities over time. The data is model generated, as it is produced by physics-based numerical simulation, not human-created or recorded from real experiments. This is clearly described in Section 2.1 (Data collection), Section E.1 (Benchmark details and equations), and also the abstract and introduction where the Prometheus dataset is introduced as simulation data covering 30 or 25 environmental conditions for tunnel and pool fires respectively."

Much of the 3D-text paired data, including captions, QA, dialogues, and task plans, is created via an LLM-assisted pipeline that uses ChatGPT prompted with 3D scene graph information to generate natural language descriptions and instructions. Thus, the textual data is both human and model generated: human involvement is via manual seed tasks, curation, human labeling, and 3D scene graph annotations, while the majority of language pairs are generated by LLMs. This is confirmed in Section 3.3 describing the LLM-assisted 3D-language data generation process and Table 1 which summarizes dataset sizes and modalities."

Since the data are collected by running policies in simulated environments and capturing image observations, it is image modality data. It is Human Generated because the trajectories are obtained from policy executions (non-expert or sub-optimal policies) in the environments, i.e., the dataset is collected by human-setup policy executions and environment rendering, not model-generated data.

This synthetic LR dataset is generated by a conditional normalizing flow model trained on pairs of real HR and LR images, using latent space interpolation and additional constraints to generate realistic LR images matching complex degradations found in real-world images. The HR images are from the RealSR dataset (human-captured), and the LR images for unseen degradation levels are model-generated via InterFlow. The resulting paired data (HR and synthesized LR images) form a new dataset introduced by the authors to train SR networks. As images are originally captured by humans and the LR images are then model-generated by the proposed method, both 'Human Generated' and 'Model Generated' are true for the image modality. The dataset is explicitly described as newly generated synthetic LR images paired with real HR images, clearly introduced by the authors (not pre-existing)."

The authors create semi-synthetic datasets (denoted as D'') by removing censored instances and then applying various synthetic censoring distributions algorithmically (uniform, exponential, original censoring-based, feature-dependent censoring, and external dataset censorship). Hence, the modality is tabular, the data is human-generated originally, but the censoring and thus final event censoring status and labels in the new datasets are model-generated via algorithmic simulation.

However, for the SkinCon and CUB datasets (Appendix A.1 and A.2), the annotations are pre-existing from previous sources or involve dataset preprocessing by the authors rather than direct human labeling from scratch. Hence, for the synthetic dataset, the annotations are not from humans but by an automatic process, but since the question asks about annotation, and the paper only presents synthetic data generation algorithmically, the effective 'annotation' is through an automatic process rather than human annotation. However, because concepts are from the datasets such as SkinCon and CUB where concept annotations were originally made by experts (stated in SkinCon as medical dataset with densely annotated concepts), and given the paper discusses concept annotation time (Appendix C), this implies annotation is by human experts for SkinCon and CUB. But since the instruction is to only consider new datasets introduced in the paper, the synthetic dataset is introduced newly here; it is generated automatically.
