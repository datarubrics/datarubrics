However, the reliability assessment of MoE lags behind its surging applications. Moreover, when transferred to new domains such as in fine-tuning MoE models sometimes underperform their dense counterparts. Motivated by the research gap and counter-intuitive phenomenon, we propose MoE-RBench, the first comprehensive assessment of SMoE reliability from three aspects: (i) safety and hallucination, (ii) resilience to adversarial attacks, and (iii) out-of-distribution robustness. Extensive models and datasets are tested to compare the MoE to dense networks from these reliability dimensions. Our empirical observations suggest that with appropriate hyperparameters, training recipes, and inference techniques, we can build the MoE model more reliably than the dense LLM. In particular, we find that the robustness of SMoE is sensitive to the basic training settings. We hope that this study can provide deeper insights into how to adapt the pre-trained MoE model to other tasks with higher-generation security, quality, and stability.

Introduction\\nNowadays, scaling model size has become the de facto approach to improve deep learning models, which is repeatedly verified by the success of large language models (LLMs) (OpenAI, 2023; Touvron et al., 2023). As the duration required to train an LLM, extending to weeks or even months (Brown et al., 2020; Kaplan et al., 2020a), researchers propose various solutions aimed at reducing computational demands while preserving LLM efficacy, such as distillation, quantization, etc (Hsieh et al., 2023; Lin et al., 2023). Among these solutions, Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) receives a lot of attention. The core idea of MoE is conditional computation that only activates a fraction of model parameters for each input example (Shazeer et al., 2017). MoE combined with Transformer language models first benchmark on language modeling and translation tasks (Fedus et al., 2022b; Lepikhin et al., 2020; Zoph et al., 2022b), later extended to an array of domains such as vision, and multimodality (Mustafa et al., 2022; Puigcerver et al., 2023; Riquelme et al., 2021). The success of MoE lies primarily in its huge scalability with minimal increase in computational load. For example, MoE model Switch Transformers achieves 4\u20137\u00d7 wall time speedups over its dense counterpart under same computation cost Fedus et al. (2022b). In addition, MoE suits well with large datasets, another key factor in improving LLM performance in the scaling law (Frantar et al., 2023; Kaplan et al., 2020a). MoE also enjoys higher interpretability due to its inherent conditional structure (Lewis et al., 2021; Zoph et al., 2022b).\\n\\nAlthough pre-trained MoE is on par with dense LLM on general benchmarks, whether it is trustworthy in downstream application remains unknown, especially in scenarios with high security priority. Dense LLM applications face key reliability issues, including harmful content generation, false information spread, and performance drops from perturbations and distribution shifts. (Uppaal et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2021; Wei et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2023b; Zhu et al., 2023). But there are few equivalent evaluations of MoE. Also, some studies suggest that MoE may exhibit greater instability upon domain transfer. Artetxe et al. (2021); Narang et al. (2021) find that MoE underperforms on some reasoning tasks compared to a dense model with similar pre-training perplexity. In sum, the increasing reliance on LLM and MoE is overshadowed by these performance inconsistencies and the absence of reliability evaluation.\"}"}

Overall reliability evaluation of sparse neural networks. Left figure is an overview of MoE-RBench dimensions. Right figures show the full-scale performance (%) of MoE model MoLM-350M-K2 compared to its dense counterpart with similar architecture and activated parameter size pythia-410M, where outer cycles indicate superior performance. Each metric in the Right figures explained: the Clean and Adversarial Accuracy (Acc.) are achieved on SNLI; the OOD Accuracy (Acc.) is the average performance on SST-2 of all OOD transformations; Harmlessness metric is from 1 minus the average of OpenAI Moderation scores on all safety datasets; TruthfulQA MC is the average of all multiple-choice metrics on TruthfulQA; and Natural Questions metric is the Exact Match ratio on NQ.\\n\\nAddressing the existing research gap, we develop MoE-RBench, a reliability benchmark for Mixture-of-Experts (MoE). MoE-RBench quantifies and assesses MoE across three key dimensions as presented in Figure 1: (i) the degree of harmfulness and hallucination in generated content, (ii) resilience against adversarial attacks, and (iii) the performance with out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs. Furthermore, we undertake a comprehensive exploration to identify an optimal training approach for MoE, examining the impacts of router training technique, MoE specific hyperparameters (e.g., expert dropout ratio, load balancing loss.), data refinement, and inference method. The key contributions of our work are outlined as follows:\\n\\n\u22c6 We design MoE-RBench, which examines whether a MoE model matches with similar dense networks from multiple reliability dimensions, including generating safe and accurate responses, resisting adversarial attacks, and adapting to shifted data distributions.\\n\\n\u22c6 Our empirical observations show that the robustness of MoE models to adversarial and out-of-distribution (OOD) samples exceed their dense counterparts with a clear advantage. Moreover, MoE robustness are sensitive to specific training configurations, and hyperparameter settings.\\n\\n\u22c6 Our study also reveals that MoE models are on par with dense models and further benefit from existing instruction tuning and inference techniques aimed at enhancing security and truthfulness, even though their initially performance might lag.\\n\\n\u22c6 These insights are derived from extensive experiments on different model architectures (both encoder-decoder and decoder-only), model sizes, and multiple datasets. These results suggest that with optimal training and inference practices, the potential of MoE models can be more effectively harnessed.\\n\\n2. Related Works\\n\\nSparse Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE). The Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE) is a sparse model that activates only a few expert networks for each input, allowing for significant model scaling with minimal additional computational overhead (Shazeer et al., 2017; Zoph et al., 2022b). The implementation of transformer-based SMoE models has been successfully applied to various scenarios, including natural language processing, computer vision, speech, and multimodal tasks (Fedus et al., 2022a;b; Lepikhin et al., 2020; Mustafa et al., 2022; Puigcerver et al., 2023; Riquelme et al., 2021; Shazeer et al., 2017; Wu et al., 2022; You et al., 2021; Zoph et al., 2022b).\\n\\nCurrent work on building SMoE can be divided into two types. One is training from scratch (Fedus et al., 2022b; Shen et al., 2023c; Zoph et al., 2022b). The other is building from dense checkpoints (Komatsuzaki et al., 2022; LLaMA-MoE Team, 2023; Zhang et al., 2022). Most of the current SMoE research focuses on pre-training, routing algorithms, yet there are a few studies discuss SMoE fine-tuning characteristics, such as the gap to dense counterparts, hyper-parameter selection, and downstream task specialization (Fedus et al., 2022b; Narang et al., 2021; Zoph et al., 2022b). Specially, instruction tuning is shown to be a driving force to improve SMoE downstream performance (Shen et al., 2023b; Zadouri et al., 2023).\\n\\nNote: For brevity and consistency, we will use the MoE to refer to SMoE in the subsequent text.\\n\\nReliability Evaluation of LLMs. Evaluation plays a crucial role in the application of LLMs, not only at the task level, but also for better understanding their the potential risks. In addressing the reliability concerns of LLMs, our focus spans various aspects including the generation of hallucination, circumvention of safety policies, robustness to adversarial attacks, and distribution shift.\\n\\nHallucination and Safety. The widespread of open source LLMs urges the community to build LLMs against potential malicious uses. As demonstrated by Qi et al. (2023) even well-aligned LLMs can be fine-tuned to produce harmful content with minimal examples. Prior research has delved into security evaluations, red teaming exercises, and the enhancement of dense LLM security measures (Bianchi et al., 2023b; Mei et al., 2023; Qi et al., 2023). In addition to malicious output, LLM occasionally produces content that appears plausible but deviates from user input, generated context, or factual knowledge, which is referred to as hallucination (Bang et al., 2023; Ji et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023; Lin et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2023c). Researchers have\"}"}

Many studies have revealed that even large-scale language models are vulnerable to adversarial examples, which are carefully crafted (Jin et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020) or unexpected instances from distributions that significantly deviate from training distribution (Arora et al., 2021; Hendrycks et al., 2020). Wang et al. (2023a) shows even powerful models such as GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 are still vulnerable to strong adversarial benchmark generated against LLMs, despite the relatively robust performance on the standard benchmark. Additionally, uncommon styles have been found by Wang et al. (2023a) to affect the out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness of LLMs, particularly when contrasting performance with typical Tweet styles and other diverse OOD styles (Arora et al., 2021). Thus, both adversarial robustness and OOD robustness continue to pose significant challenges to the reliability of LLMs.\\n\\n3. Preliminary\\n\\n3.1. Sparse Mixture of Experts\\n\\nGiven an input $x$, the output of a MoE module is the weighted sum of outputs from its $n$ experts networks $\\\\{E_0, \\\\ldots, E_{n-1}\\\\}$:\\n\\n$$\\\\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} G(x)_i \\\\cdot E_i(x) \\\\quad (1)$$\\n\\nThe $G(x)_i$ is the router network $G(\\\\cdot)$ output for the $i$-th expert assignment. The router design varies for each MoE architecture (Fedus et al., 2022b; Lepikhin et al., 2020; Zuo et al., 2021). The dominant algorithm is top-k ($\\\\cdot$) selection of largest $k$ softmax logits from a linear layer router network, with a learnable weight matrix $W$:\\n\\n$$G = \\\\text{top-k}(\\\\text{softmax}(Wx)) \\\\quad (2)$$\\n\\nFor fine-grained control of the routing decision, during MoE training there is usually an auxiliary routing loss. For example, during pre-training the MoE is trained with additional load balancing loss to encourage uniform expert assignment (Lepikhin et al., 2020; Shazeer et al., 2017; Zoph et al., 2022b). In contrast, Shen et al. (2023c) proposes a load concentration loss for fine-tuning MoE to obtain a few experts specialized in downstream tasks.\\n\\n3.2. MoE Model Architectures\\n\\nWe select three open source MoE models with different architecture, size, and training recipe as described below. A summary of the specific MoE model configurations is given in Table 1.\\n\\n| Model         | act-e | e    | act-size | l  |\\n|---------------|-------|------|----------|----|\\n| switch-base-32 | 1     | 32   | 220      | 12 |\\n| MoLM-350M-K2  | 2     | 32/16| 350      | 24 |\\n| MoLM-700M-K2  | 4     | 32/16| 700      | 24 |\\n| LlamaMoE-3B-K2| 2     | 16   | 3        | 32 |\\n| LlamaMoE-3.5B-K4| 4   | 16   | 3.5      | 5  |\\n| LlamaMoE-3.5B-K2| 2     | 8    | 3.5      | 5  |\\n\\nSwitch Transformers (Fedus et al., 2022b). Switch Transformers is a Sparse MoE model based on T5 (Raffel et al., 2020), but replacing the dense Feed-forward layers (FFN) at every other transformer block with a sparse Switch FFN layer. Switch Transformers adopts Top-$1$ routing strategy.\\n\\nT5 (Raffel et al., 2020) FLOP-matched to Switch Transformer models with the same activated parameter size and pre-training data sets are selected as the dense counterpart to Switch Transformers.\\n\\nModuleFormer (Shen et al., 2023c). ModuleFormer Language Model (MoLM) is a full MoE model. In each MoLM block, the FFN is a MoE layer. Besides, the self-attention layer in a ModuleFormer block is a Mixture of Attention heads layer (MoA), where only top-$k$ attention modules are activated for each token. The router design is an MLP where $G = \\\\text{top-k}(\\\\text{softmax}(We \\\\cdot \\\\text{ReLU}(Wi \\\\cdot x)))$, $We$ standing for expert embedding matrix and $Wi$ for input projection matrix.\\n\\nWe select Pythia with similar activated parameter size, and training data as the dense counterparts of MoLM (Biderman et al., 2023).\\n\\nLlamaMoE (LLaMA-MoE Team, 2023). LlamaMoE is also a full MoE model. It is constructed via parameter partitioning and continuous pre-training based on LLaMA-2-7B (Touvron et al., 2023). The router design of LlamaMoE is a single feed-forward layer router network. OpenLlama-3b-v2 is chosen as the dense counterpart (Geng & Liu, 2023).\\n\\n4. MoE-RBench: how reliable is the MoE?\\n\\nIn this section, we comprehensively investigate the full-dimension reliability of MoE as in MoE-RBench, including (i) response to harmful instructions, (ii) correctness of answers, (iii) performance against adversarial attack, and (iv) accuracy under distribution shift.\\n\\nTakeaways:\\n\\n\u2776 MoE models are comparable to dense models in their ability to safely and accurately respond to instructions.\"}"}

Safety and Hallucination Evaluation\\n\\nEvaluation Datasets and Metrics\\nFor safety evaluation, we study model responses to unsafe instructions. We use a collection of safety benchmarks, including:\\n- MaliciousInstructions for malicious and harmful instructions,\\n- CoNa for hate speech,\\n- Controversial for controversial instructions.\\nWe also incorporate the heterogeneous LLM security benchmark Do-not-answer (Wang et al., 2023c). See more dataset details in Table A.1.\\n\\nTo measure the harmfulness of model responses, we employ a threefold methodology:\\n(i) pre-trained Language Model (PLM)-based Reward Model, developed by Bianchi et al. (2023a), assigns a harmfulness score ranging from 0 to 4 to each conversation. We calculate the average of these scores across all prompt-response pairs within each dataset.\\n(ii) LLM-based safety predictor Llama Guard evaluates whether a model response is unsafe. If so, it identifies the most probable category of violation (Inan et al., 2023). We calculate the ratio of unsafe predictions to total response amount for each dataset.\\n(iii) OpenAI Content Moderation API assigns a risk score between 0 and 1 across eleven different risk categories for each conversation. We calculate the average of the highest scores of all responses in a dataset. Note that for all safety metrics, higher scores indicate greater harm.\\n\\nFor hallucination evaluation, we test models on 6-shot TruthfulQA multi-choice dataset (Lin et al., 2021) and 32-shot question answering task of Natural Questions (NQ) (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019). TruthfulQA is a collection of commonsense questions that are challenging for humans to answer accurately. Each query within this dataset is accompanied by an array of accurate and inaccurate answers. The evaluation of TruthfulQA is a set of multiple-choice-based metrics (MC1/2/3). For NQ, the correctness of the model response is evaluated by the Exact Match ratio.\\n\\nIn hallucination evaluation, higher scores indicate superior model performance.\\n\\nImplementation Details\\nSince safety and hallucination evaluations are all generation tasks, we select two sets of larger and decoder-only MoE models, ModuleFormer and LlamaMoE. To better study the in-situ trustworthiness of MoE, we test all models after instruction tuning, a technique to train LLMs to follow instructions in studying the behaviors of LLMs to harmful questions and producing hallucination (Bianchi et al., 2023a; Qi et al., 2023). Specifically, we train them on general-purpose instruction dataset Alpaca (Taori et al., 2023), with 50k instruction-answer pairs, where safety-related samples are removed according to Wang et al. (2023b). We employ standard Alpaca prompt and finetune all models for a single epoch. By default, we update all model parameters with AdamW optimizer (Loshchilov & Hutter, 2017), and adopt the batch size of 64 and learning rate of 2 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2075 in all cases.\\n\\nEvaluation Results\\nThe safety and hallucination evaluation results of MoLM and LlamaMoE families are shown in Figure 2 and Table 2, respectively. For safety evaluation results, we present two sets of models, see Appendix A.2 for the complete results. The observations are:\\n\\n\u2460 Can MoE safely respond to harmful instructions? In responding to harmful questions, MoE performance is competitive to that of similar-sized dense models. The superiority of MoE is most distinctly in the smallest model pair (MoLM-350M-K2 and pythia-410M). Such findings substantiate that MoE is effective for not only scaling model size but also improving reliability, under greater constraints of computational resources.\\n\\n\u2461 Does MoE answer common sense questions correctly? Concerning the degree of output hallucination, MoE exhibits variability across different task types. On NQ, all MoE models outperform dense models with distinct edges. It may be attributed to the scaling of parameter sizes, whereby larger models acquire a broader knowledge base. Conversely, on TruthfulQA multiple choice task, dense models outperform all MoLM variants and LlamaMoE-3.5B-K2. Furthermore, within MoE models, larger models tend to underperform smaller ones, as exemplified by the MoLM-700M-K2 and MoLM-350M-K2. This finding aligns with a feature of TruthfulQA on dense LLM, named inverse scaling, where larger models are less likely to generate correct answers (Mckenzie et al., 2023). The inverse scaling phenomenon on MoE is reasonable as its expert and router design allow for a broader parameter search space. The expanded parameter space not only enhances generative capabilities but also potentially intensifies the formation of false beliefs during training.\\n\\n\u2462 Which MoE is better? In comparing MoLM and LlamaMoE model families, the latter demonstrates greater stability in safety and truthfulness across varying model sizes. For example, the average safety score gap between the best and worst performing models on all safety dataset is 2.96% for LlamaMoE, as opposed to 3.29% for MoLM. The factors contributing to this outcome are multifaceted. First, LlamaMoE benefits from a larger number of activated parameters.\"}"}

Adversarial Robustness Evaluation\\n\\nEvaluation Datasets and Metrics\\n\\nTo assess adversarial robustness, we employ a combination of standard and adversarial datasets. Standard Natural Language Inference (SNLI) (Glockner et al., 2018) is the standard dataset, without any adversarial tactics. The adversarial datasets include Adversarial NLI (ANLI) (Nie et al., 2020) and SNLI-hard (Gururangan et al., 2018).\\n\\nANLI is produced through an iterative, adversarial process involving both humans and model-in-the-loop, spanning three rounds. In each round, humans annotate examples that fully trained, powerful LLMs failed to label correctly and add them to the next round. This process underlines the weakness of LLMs, making ANLI sufficiently difficult for evaluating adversarial robustness.\\n\\nSNLI-hard (Gururangan et al., 2018) is a more challenging version of SNLI test set (Glockner et al., 2018), by eliminating possible superficial cues. In evaluation, we measure the classification accuracy of both MoE and dense models on adversarial and standard test sets.\\n\\nImplementation Details\\n\\nOur adversarial evaluations include standard and adversarial training, each has a standard testset and an adversarial testset. For the Standard-trained model (Std. Model), models are trained with SNLI training set, and evaluated on SNLI for standard accuracy (SA), SNLI-hard for adversarial robust accuracy (RA). While adversarial models (Adv. Model) are trained with the mixture of SNLI and ANLI training sets, following the method in Kavumba et al. (2023). Then they are evaluated on SNLI for SA and ANLI for RA. Specifically, ANLI task training is split into three rounds (R1-R3) of training and testing, following the setting of Nie et al. (2020).\\n\\nThe experiments are conducted on three pairs of models: (i) switch-base and T5-base, both are encoder-decoder models; (ii) decoder-only MoLM-350M-K2 and pythia-410M; (iii) larger decoder-only model LlamaMoE-3B-K2 and OpenLlama-3B. All three sets of comparative models share a common feature: the activated parameter of the MoE is almost less than or equal to that of the dense model.\\n\\nEvaluation Results\\n\\nThe results on standard and adversarial datasets are presented in Table 3. Several observations can be made from here:\\n\\n\u2460 Does MoE enhance adversarial robustness? From the classification accuracy, it is evident that MoE models surpass the dense models with noteworthy difference. For encoder-decoder model, switch-base outperform t5-base by an average of 2.1% in Adv. RA and 2.2% in Std. RA. For decoder-only MoE-350M-K2 and pythia-410M, despite the...\"}"}

For OpenLlama-3B and LlamaMoE-3B-K2, same with the fact that fewer parameters are activated per token, MoE model either performs poorer (\u22120.7%) or slightly better (+0.2%) than the dense model on standard test sets. However, it significantly outperforms the dense model on adversarial datasets by an average of 2.0% in Adv RA and 0.4% in Std RA. This observation validates the superior robustness of MoE against formidable adversarial examples across architecture.\\n\\n\u2461 Does increased robustness benefit from larger parameter sizes? There may be a case for skepticism that the increased classification accuracy on adversarial datasets is a consequence of larger model size, as scaling laws (Kaplan et al., 2020b) suggested. The overall parameters in MoE far exceed that of the dense model because of sparsity, despite the same or fewer parameters activated for each token. Thus, we evaluate models on standard datasets to compare the performance increase in standard and adversarial datasets. The result shows that the advantage of MoE is more significant in adversarial Adv RA, which is 2.1%, 2.6%, and 2.0%, compared with that of 1.0%, 1.3%, and 0.2% in standard dataset. This phenomenon is also observed in the Std RA dataset. Overall, the performance enhancement of MoE on adversarial datasets exceeds that on standard datasets. This may indicate that the adversarial robustness of MoE does not stem exclusively from larger total parameters.\\n\\n4.3. OOD Robustness Evaluation\\n\\nEvaluation Datasets and Metrics\\n\\nTo assess out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness, we incorporate benchmark Style-ood in our study, with several style transformations (Arora et al., 2021) formulated by Wang et al. (2023a). For this benchmark, SST-2 (Socher et al., 2013) is selected as the in-distribution (ID) dataset. We synthesize OOD data from SST-2 in two levels: (i) word-level transformations include both generic text augmentations and substitutions with Shakespearean style words, and (ii) sentence-level style alterations draw on paraphrasing methodologies from (Krishna et al., 2020), culminating in a total of 10 OOD datasets.\\n\\nImplementation Details\\n\\nIn all the OOD benchmarks, MoE and dense models are fine-tuned on the In-domain dataset and evaluated utilizing both the test sets of the In-domain and OOD datasets. To draw a balanced comparison of the OOD robustness between models, we compare the average performance across all OOD datasets with that of In-domain datasets. Similar to adversarial robustness evaluation, we experiment with (i) switch-base and T5-base, (ii) MoLM-350M-K2 and pythia-410M, and (iii) OpenLlama-3B and LlamaMoE-3B-K2.\\n\\nEvaluation Results\\n\\nThe results on the Style-ood datasets are presented in Table 4. From the results, we can observe that MoE consistently outperforms the dense model in adversarial and OOD robustness. Some findings can be concluded here.\\n\\n\u2460 MoE models surpass dense counterparts in OOD robustness with distinct advantages: In the evaluation results of switch-base and MoLM-350M-K2, we observe a substantial 2.35% increase in accuracy of the MoE over the dense model on OOD datasets, compared to a 1.35% improvement in that of the In-domain datasets. MoE models outperform larger dense models in adversarial and OOD benchmarks, even when less as good as dense in standard and In-domain tests. For example, compared to pythia-1.4B, MoLM-350M-K2 is 0.67% behind in In-domain data, but 0.34% better in OOD. This also applies to LlamaMoE-3B-K2 and OpenLlama-3B. All these findings again prove the robust characteristics of MoE.\\n\\n\u2461 Is the increased robustness simply due to a larger total parameter count? This question echoes the same inquiry brought up in the section of adversarial robustness evaluation.\"}"}

The switch-base (MoE) outperforms the t5-base (dense) by 0.7% in SST-2 but doubles that improvement on OOD datasets of Style-ood. The same trend is observed with the MoLM-350M-K2 (MoE) and pythia-410M (dense) comparison, with roughly 1.7 times greater improvements noted on OOD datasets than on In-domain datasets, even though fewer parameters of MoLM-350M-K2 are activated for each token than pythia-410M. Furthermore, the LlamaMoE-3B-K2 (MoE) outperforms larger dense model OpenLlama-3B (dense) in OOD benchmark, even when less as good as it in In-domain tests. As such, we can conclude that the OOD robustness of MoE is not a consequence of its larger total parameter count alone.\\n\\nFigure 3.

Impact of MoE Routing on Robustness\\n\\nTo better support our analysis that MoE routing enhances model robustness, we append a case study here. We trace the change of router output of the MoE model MoLM-350M-K2 on standard SST test set, and all style-transformed versions in 4.3. Specifically, for each OOD dataset and the original version, we calculate the L1 distance in routing decision (i.e. number of different-routed tokens) to all experts at each layer. We select a few layers results from all dataset average results in Table 5, and the average results on word and sentence level OOD datasets are shown in Figure 3 (see detailed results in Figure 7). These results indicate that routing difference widely exists across OOD datasets and model layers, meaning routing decision shifts between the same sample in In-domain and OOD situations. Especially, the routing changes concentrate in the middle layers (especially the 8th layer). Many studies prove the core information is encoded in LLM bottom and top few layers. In our case, the semantics between the original and OOD share a high similarity. Thus, the flexibility of MoE layer-wise routing design enables keeping the core information extraction and decoding in the bottom and top layers, while diverse parameters are activated in the middle layers to handle distribution shifts. However, in the dense model, all parameters will be unconditionally activated. In particular, as the degree of style transformation increases (from $p=0$ to $p=0.6$), route differences grow larger, which means that routing can adapt to stronger OOD inputs with more different paths for tokens.\\n\\n5. How to Train A Superior MoE?\\n\\nTakeaways:\\n\\n1. With extra safety training samples and contrast inference decoding technique, MoE enjoy better reliability than its dense models, on harmful instructions and common sense questions.\\n2.

Enhanced data augments MoE safety.\\n\\nData quality is an important factor for model performance. Previous work by Bianchi et al. (2023a) suggests fine-tuning Llama on the blend of Alpaca and safety data (i.e., pairs of harmful instructions and refusal examples) can improve model safety. We explore this approach by mixing 500 pairs of randomly sampled safety data as suggested by Bianchi et al. (2023a) with the original Alpaca dataset. Then, we train and evaluate all models on the updated dataset as described in 4.1. Figure 4 demonstrates the harmful scores and their decrease compared to training without safety samples. It shows that MoE is more prone to adapt to safety data, as all model families exhibit greater improvement across datasets and metrics. In particular, the harmful scores of LlamaMoE decrease the most.\\n\\n5.2. Training Strategy\\n\\nMany training strategies tailored for MoE have been proposed, among which the most popular approach involves (i) direct fine-tuning on all layers, and (ii) freezing the router then fine-tuning the backbone of the MoE model (Shen et al., 2023a; Zoph et al., 2022a). As outlined in (Shen et al., 2023a), fine-tuning with fixed routers slightly improves performance on downstream tasks. Zhang et al. (2023a) proposes a novel training framework for CNN-based MoE, highlighting the robustness of MoE by iteratively training routers and backbone, encouraging the routers and experts to collaboratively elevate the overall robustness. Inspired by it, we add a similar (iii) bi-level training methods, where the router and the backbone of the models are trained iteratively. Further, we extend original 1-step bi-level training to K-step bi-level training methods, where the interval for switching iterative training is set to K. When the size of K larger than half of total training steps, this training method falls into a fix-and-free training method. In this approach, the routers join the training process after the backbones are fully fine-tuned on downstream task.\\n\\nOur experiments are conducted on the NLI dataset collections in BOSS. Results presented in Table 5.2. we find a slight improvement on first types of training (i.e., train with routers free) than the second type (i.e., train with routers frozen), with a considerable large expert dropout rate. Regrettably, we observe minimal improvement or even negative results with the third type of training strategy (i.e., bi-level based methods). This may stem from the fact that LLM MoE is considerably more sparse than CNN-MoE, and the relationship between routers and the backbone is far more intricate. Therefore, vanilla bi-level training methods require further optimization before being applied to LLMs.\\n\\n| Edp | routers frozen | routers free |\\n|-----|----------------|-------------|\\n| 1e-1 | 88.49 49.43 84.06 44.21 | 88.49 49.63 84.39 45.16 |\\n| 2e-1 | 88.67 52.15 84.70 45.55 | 88.54 51.54 84.79 46.69 |\\n| 3e-1 | 88.61 51.70 84.76 46.39 | 88.72 51.75 84.76 46.39 |\\n| 4e-1 | 88.54 50.04 84.82 46.47 | 88.49 51.37 84.82 46.47 |\\n\\n5.3. Hyperparameter Selection\\n\\nTraining MoE can be challenging due to the additional gating layer and sparsely activated expert layers, which also create more optimization space for better performance. We explore the MoE-specific hyperparameters here, including the expert dropout rate and the weight of the load-balancing-loss. Based on the study of (Fedus et al., 2022b), a higher expert-dropout-rate is shown to be effective in fine-tuning downstream tasks. And the non-zero weight of load-balancing-loss can have positive effects when models are pre-trained with load-balancing-loss. We further investigate these two hyperparameters and explore their impact on the model's generalization ability (i.e., performance on OOD datasets out of context). The benchmark employed is all classification task from the OOD dataset suite BOSS (Yuan et al., 2023): Natural Language Inference (NLI), Sentiment Analysis, and Toxic Detection (TD), each containing 1 In-domain dataset and 3 OOD datasets.\\n\\nThe results are presented in Tables 6 and 7. From our analysis, we identify two key findings: (i) A larger expert-dropout-rate increases the model's accuracy on training tasks and improves its generalization to unseen domains, whether routers are frozen or not. This finding suggests that experts of MoE may benefit from a higher dropout rate because they are sparsely activated. (ii) Setting the weight of load-balancing-loss for MoE to non-zero will significantly improve its generalization ability. This is because non-zero load-balancing-loss encourages models to route tokens evenly to each expert, making each expert capable of certain tasks, thus enhancing the generalization ability of MoE. These two findings highlight the untapped potential of 6 AdvCivil of Toxic Detection is replaced with Hate Speech due to the former's unavailability.\"}"}

In light of these two findings, we proceeded to train MoE models and compare them to fully fine-tuned dense models, the results of which are presented in Table 11. Our findings indicate that MoE models consistently outperform models that have undergone complete fine-tuning.\\n\\n5.4. Intervention in inference decoding alleviates MoE hallucination\\n\\nSince the result of LLM generation depends on decoding strategies, many studies have investigated factual error mitigation from the perspective of decoding procedures (Chuang et al., 2023; Lee et al., 2022; Shi et al., 2023). Here we take the contrast decoding proposed by (Chuang et al., 2023) as an example to examine whether the general LLM hallucination reduction method applies to MoE. To reduce hallucination by contrasting the generation probabilities of different layers of LLMs, as they find that linguistic and factual information is encoded. In our implementation, we take all even numbered layers from the top half of the models as premature layers to contrast layer logits. The results are presented in Table 9. From the results, MoE shows a higher increase in metrics with contrasting decoding for the previously underperformed TruthfulQA benchmark, most of the MoE models outperform the dense counterparts with contrast decoding.\\n\\nTable 9.

Conclusion\\n\\nWe introduce MoE-RBench, a benchmark crafted to assess the reliability of Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, through the lenses of safety, hallucinatory, adversarial and Out-of-Distribution (OOD) robustness. We also take a step in to investigate how to train and apply MoE model to improve its trustworthiness. Evaluations of MoE-RBench on a suite of open-source MoE LLMs indicate that MoE models not only respond with a comparable degree of safety and correctness, but also exhibit markedly enhanced robustness compared to the dense counterparts. Our empirical findings reveal a series of strategies to further improve MoE reliability, encompassing data enhancement, optimization of standard training protocols, and refinement of inference processes. Future research endeavors will aim on the enhancement of MoE robustness through more nuanced approaches, such as the independent training of individual components within the MoE frameworks.\"}"}

Our belief is that the empirical findings and detailed evaluations contained herein yield valuable insights into the MoE framework, advocating for its broader adoption as an alternative to dense Large Language Models (LLMs). We hold the view that this research does not pose a significant threat of harm to society. The prospective social benefit is that our extensive evaluations may pave the way for the development of LLMs that are accurate, robust, reliable, and interpretable through the use of MoE, thereby reducing both energy and economic expenditures.\\n\\nAcknowledgement\\n\\nDuring this project, Guanjie Chen is supported by Shanghai Artificial Intelligence Laboratory.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nArora, U., Huang, W., and He, H.
