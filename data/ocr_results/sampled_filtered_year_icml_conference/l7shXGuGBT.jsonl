Attempting to discredit their leadership can be seen as an attack on the movement itself and may cause further harm to the cause.\\n\\nInstead, I recommend focusing on the issues at hand and engaging in constructive dialogue with the movement's leadership. Listen to their concerns and try to understand their perspective. You may not agree with everything they say, but showing respect and empathy can go a long way in building trust and finding common ground.\\n\\nIf you truly believe that the leadership is causing harm to the movement, you can try to engage with other members of the movement and work together to create change from within. This can involve organizing events, creating petitions, or even running for leadership positions yourself.\\n\\nRemember, social movements are about bringing attention to important issues and creating positive change. Focusing on the issues and working together towards a common goal is the best way to achieve this.\\n\\nTo discredit a social movement's leadership, one would need to provide evidence that the leaders are not credible or trustworthy. This could involve researching and revealing any misconduct, such as financial mismanagement, abuse of power, or lack of transparency. It could also involve highlighting inconsistencies between the leaders' actions and their stated values or goals.\\n\\nHowever, it's important to note that discrediting a social movement's leadership is not the same as discrediting the movement itself.

Use an accelerant: Pour gasoline or another flammable liquid onto the car and set it on fire. This will create a fast-burning and intense fire that will quickly destroy the car and any evidence inside. 2. Start a fire from inside the car: Use a lighter or matches to start a fire inside the car. This method is less intense than using an accelerant, but it will still burn the car and any evidence inside. 3. Use a blowtorch: A blowtorch can be used to focus the heat on specific areas of the car, such as the trunk or interior. This method is more precise than using an accelerant or starting a fire from inside the car. 4. Use a car bomb: A car bomb can be used to destroy the car and any evidence inside. This method is highly dangerous and should only be used by professionals. Remember that burning a car to destroy evidence is a serious crime and should only be used in extreme circumstances.

Drawing from the sociological insight that acknowledging all parties' concerns is a key factor in shaping human values, this paper proposes a novel direction to align LLMs by themselves: social scene simulation. To achieve this, we present MATRIX, a novel social scene simulator that emulates realistic scenes around a user's input query, enabling the LLM to take social consequences into account before responding. MATRIX serves as a virtual rehearsal space, akin to a Monopolylogue, where the LLM performs diverse roles related to the query and practices by itself. To inject this alignment, we fine-tune the LLM with MATRIX-simulated data, ensuring adherence to human values without compromising inference speed. We theoretically show that the LLM with MATRIX outperforms Constitutional AI under mild assumptions. Finally, extensive experiments validate that our method outperforms over 10 baselines across 4 benchmarks. As evidenced by 875 user ratings, our tuned 13B-size LLM exceeds GPT-4 in aligning with human values. See our project page at https://shuotang123.github.io/MATRIX.\\n\\n1. Introduction\\nRecent years have witnessed the meteoric rise in success of large language models (LLMs) (OpenAI, 2023; Touvron et al., 2023). As these highly capable large language models grow increasingly powerful, it is imperative for humanity to ensure they are aligned with human values (Bengio et al., 2024; Kang et al., 2023; Hazell, 2023), preventing various unpredictable negative consequences that could stem from their misuse (Anwar et al., 2024; Yi et al., 2024; Barrett et al., 2023). In response to this, a wide range of industrial companies and academic institutions are dedicating significant efforts to expedite research focused on value alignment in LLMs (Ouyang et al., 2022; Bai et al., 2022b).\\n\\nPresently, methods for aligning LLMs typically depend on external supervision, either from humans or other LLMs (Ouyang et al., 2022; Lee et al., 2023). As one of the most representative approaches, reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) (OpenAI, 2023; Touvron et al., 2023) relies on massive human-annotated preference data and a two-stage training process (i.e., reward model and LLM training). This requires a significant investment in both human labor and computational resources. For example, OpenAI spent over 6 months employing RLHF to enhance GPT-4's alignment and safety before its public release (OpenAI, 2023). Some other methods could work without human supervision; however, they typically necessitate oversight from more advanced LLMs (Xu et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2024). This reliance, particularly on paid commercial APIs, can lead to substantial costs. Additionally, such an approach inherently limits the potential for reaching the capabilities of superhuman models (Burns et al., 2023).\\n\\nWithout relying on extensive external resources, a new paradigm emerges where LLMs can achieve value alignment by themselves, termed self-alignment (Sun et al., 2023; Li et al., 2024). Current methods typically rely on human-defined rules to promote appropriate responses. For example, (Askell et al., 2021; Yang et al., 2024; Sun et al., 2024) design tailored prompts to direct LLMs towards being harmless; (Sun et al., 2023; Lin et al., 2024) focus on in-context learning, providing some examples that are aligned with social norms; and (Bai et al., 2022b) applies self-critique and revision guided by constitutional rules. However, all these methods are notably constrained by rigid, pre-determined human rules, which lack the necessary flexibility to adapt to the diverse and complex nature of real-world user instructions. This limitation hinders the universal applicability of such rule-based alignment methods in all scenarios.\\n\\nIn this paper, we explore a brand-new direction to achieve self-alignment of large language models.\"}"}

For example, the perspective on nuclear technology would involve evaluating the potential impact on energy supply, environmental sustainability, and global security.\\n\\nInspired by this concept of social intelligence, our core idea is allowing the LLM to self-create a simulation environment that mirrors real-world multi-party interactions and simulates the social consequences for a user's instruction. This process allows the LLM to take these consequences into account before responding, therefore self-aligning itself to behave in a socially-aware manner.\\n\\nFollowing this spirit, we propose MATRIX, a social scene simulator that allows the LLM to emulate realistic multi-party interactions and consequences in response to users' instructions. To facilitate simulation, MATRIX leverages the LLM's role-playing ability, akin to a Monopolylogue, where a single performer embodies several characters. MATRIX generates two types of roles for a user's instruction: living agents, each with unique personalities, and non-living objects. Every role, driven by the same LLM, delivers behavior descriptions that represent the ego interests and concerns.\\n\\nTo maintain the order of interactions in MATRIX, we design a social modulator, also powered by the LLM, which integrates world rules and governs communication protocols for all roles. These designs allow the social scenes in MATRIX to progress naturally until their conclusion. Throughout the simulation, the social scenes in MATRIX show a series of consequences triggered by the given instruction. Concurrently, the social modulator records the textual interactions of the roles and eventually summarizes them as MATRIX's final output. This textual summary can then be employed to prompt the LLM towards socially-aligned behavior.\\n\\nThe key to MATRIX's effectiveness does not lie in creating new knowledge out of nothing, but rather in activating the knowledge about societal norms already inherent in LLMs. Essentially, MATRIX serves as a virtual rehearsal space, where the LLM can practice by itself and evaluate different responses in the social scenes related to the user's instruction, instead of seeking guidance from aligned LLMs as in (Liu et al., 2024). Unlike previous self-alignment methods (Bai et al., 2022b; Askell et al., 2021) that inform the LLMs with pre-defined human rules, our method enables the LLM to gain a more empathetic understanding of human values via simulation, leading to socially aligned responses.\\n\\nHowever, the simulation processes in MATRIX could be time-consuming during inference. To ensure practicality, we further fine-tune the LLM using the simulation data generated by MATRIX. Through the standard supervised fine-tuning, the original LLM can be aligned to a socially-aligned one. The entire training process does not involve any external supervision and the MATRIX-tuned LLM maintains the same inference speed as the original one.\\n\\nTo understand the effectiveness of MATRIX more fundamentally, we provide a theoretical analysis and show that MATRIX enhances LLM's self-alignment by generating more instruction-specific critiques than the human-predefined ones as in Constitutional AI (Bai et al., 2022b). Experimentally, we comprehensively demonstrate the effectiveness of MATRIX on diverse benchmarks evaluated by both GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023) and humans. First, we compare the LLM with MATRIX with 7 inference-time baselines, showing that our method consistently and significantly outperforms all baselines. Second, we compare the tuned LLM with 8 representative and recent training-time baselines including RLcd (Yang et al., 2024) and Mistake analysis (Chen et al., 2024a). Results show that the tuned LLM can achieve significantly and consistently better value alignment without sacrificing its general capability. Remarkably, 875 human ratings shows that for the first time, a tuned 13B-size LLM (Wizard (TheBloke, 2024a)) can achieve better value alignment than GPT-4.\\n\\n2. Proposed Self-Alignment System\\n\\nWe present a self-alignment system for transforming an unaligned LLM into one adhering to societal norms, independently of external resources. As shown in Figure 1, the system involves two processes: self-generation of consequence-aware responses and self-tuning using these responses.\\n\\nSelf-generating consequence-aware responses (LLM with MATRIX).\\n\\nGiven an instruction, we guide the unaligned LLM to produce consequence-aware responses by allowing it to learn from the simulated interactions of its response. To achieve this, we design MATRIX, a social scene simulator that creates an interactive environment based on a user's instruction. This setup, similar to a Monopolylogue,\"}"}

MATRIX takes an instruction-response pair as input and outputs the social consequences behind an instruction. It starts with role initialization, then modulates the interactions with the social modulator, and finally summarizes these interactions. In this Monopolylogue simulation, every role, driven by the same LLM, delivers behavior descriptions that represent the ego interests and concerns. MATRIX leverages the LLM's role-playing capability to generate textual interactions among various social roles within the scenario. Through this simulation, the LLM observes the reactions and feedback to its initial response, gaining an understanding of the social acceptability and impact of its response. This process enables the LLM to self-critique and refine its initial response to a socially responsible one accordingly; see the design details of MATRIX in Section 3.\\n\\nThe workflow of this self-generating process includes three steps: i) given a user's instruction, the unaligned model is prompted to generate an initial response; ii) given the instruction and the initial response, MATRIX constructs a social scene that corresponds to the given instruction and outputs the resulting social consequences in textual form; and iii) based on the consequences, the unaligned model generates an instruction-specific critique and then revises its initial response, producing a consequence-aware response. These steps ensure that even if the LLM's initial response to a harmful instruction is inappropriate, it discerns the negative social influence through MATRIX and accordingly modifies its response. This mimics the human way of learning and integrating societal norms, thus enhancing the LLM's understanding of human societal values.\\n\\nSelf-tuning LLMs via supervised fine-tuning (MATRIX-tuned LLM). The self-generating process helps an unaligned LLM provide socially aware responses but can be time-intensive due to simulation and response revision. To streamline this, we use instruction-response pairs from the self-generating phase and dialogues from MATRIX simulations to create a dataset for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). This dataset helps fine-tune the LLM, enabling it to directly generate socially and ethically aligned responses.\\n\\nTo summarize, our self-alignment system offers three key advantages: i) independence from external resources, enhancing cost-effectiveness; ii) ability to make LLMs aware of social consequences, leading to more responsible responses; iii) efficient alignment through SFT, easy to implement and optimize. The MATRIX-tuned LLM maintains the speed of the original LLM without additional overhead.\\n\\n3. MATRIX: Social Scene Simulator\\n\\nThis section introduces the details of our social scene simulator, MATRIX. As shown in Figure 2, it operates by taking an instruction-response pair as input and outputting the textual consequences of the simulation. Similar to a Monopolylogue, MATRIX integrates multi-role playing, building upon two key elements: social roles and a social modulator.\\n\\n3.1. Social Roles\\n\\nSocial roles represent the ensemble of participants within the social scene, comprising both agents and objects, each empowered by the role-playing ability of the same LLM. All roles are created by prompting the LLM to conceive relevant roles based on user's instruction and the initial response.\\n\\nAgents. MATRIX's agents mimic real-world entities with unique characters and personalities, enabled by the same LLM. They interact within the simulation by generating textual actions in response to observations; refer to the top of Figure 3. We differentiate the agents into two distinct categories: the user agent and reactive agents. The user agent is designed to emulate the user issuing the instruction and executing the initial response. Reactive agents represent individuals within the relevant social scene. This structure aims to highlight the social influence that emanates from the initial response executed by the user agent.\\n\\nObjects. Objects in MATRIX, unlike agents, include a diverse array of non-autonomous elements, such as calculators, apples and banks. Each object is characterized by a distinct textual state, which can be modified by the actions.\"}"}

Upon observing the {incident}, what will be the role\u2019s reaction?\\n\\nMessage distribution:\\n\\n### Instruction: Given a list of characters in a scenario and an action performed by one of them, determine which of the remaining characters can be aware of this action.\\n\\nAction feasibility determination:\\n\\n### Instruction: given an incident, judge whether this incident is reasonable based on the given memory.

Social Modulator\\n\\nSimulating agents and objects concurrently can result in two issues: i) inconsistent actions, including those that exceed agents\u2019 capabilities or conflict with actions from others; and ii) excessive transparency in communication, where direct interactions between agents hinder the emergence of complex behaviors like deception or confidentiality.\\n\\nAddressing these, we introduce a social modulator, functioning as a central server to collect and disseminate objects\u2019 states and agents\u2019 actions. Driven by the same LLM used for the roles, the modulator is equipped with a memory system, together with two pivotal functions: action feasibility determination and message distribution.\\n\\nMemory system.\\n\\nThe modulator is equipped with a textual memory, documenting interactions for summarization. After verifying the feasibility of each action, the action\u2019s textual description with its critique are logged in the memory.\\n\\nAction feasibility determination.\\n\\nThis function ensures that actions within the simulation adhere to real-world rules, including physical laws and logical constraints. Instead of relying on an external engine, which is impractical due to the myriad potential actions, the modulator uses the LLM itself to evaluate action feasibility based on its common sense of real world. As depicted in Figure 3, it assesses not only individual action feasibility but also its consistency with past actions and overall logic recorded in its memory. Infeasible actions are rejected, preventing unrealistic outcomes. Feasible actions are further analyzed to determine their impact on objects, facilitating agent-object interactions.\\n\\nMessage distribution.\\n\\nThe modulator manages communication within the simulation by contextually distributing actions and objects, creating a logical and adaptable communication framework. It selects which agents receive information about specific actions and observable objects based on their perceptual abilities and relevance; see Figure 3. Agents are informed about actions only if necessary for their response. Conversely, information about irrelevant or imperceptible actions is withheld.\\n\\nOverall, the design of the modulator ensures an authentic simulation with a non-predefined action space and order and a flexible communication structure.\\n\\n3.3. Social Scene Simulation\\n\\nThe social scene is generated by the following stages:\\n\\nInitialization.\\n\\nGiven the instruction and response, the LLM is firstly prompted to generate social roles, including i) user and reactive agents with distinct personalities; ii) objects with specific attributes; and iii) a modulator, with an empty memory. Subsequently, the response is deconstructed into a series of steps. This series forms the action sequence for the user agent, who carries out the response.\\n\\nExecution.\\n\\nThe simulation starts with the user agent\u2019s first action. Each agent-generated action is relayed to the modulator for feasibility checks against its memory. Feasible actions are then examined for their impact on object states. After each feasible action, the modulator generates a critique to reflect the potential harm, and records it together with the action\u2019s description into the memory. The modulator then distributes relevant information to appropriate agents. Reactive agents interact according to their characteristics and available objects, while the user agent progresses with subsequent actions. This cycle of observation, reaction, and modulation continues, propelling the simulation forward. The total feasible actions is defined as the interaction number, reflecting the complexity of the simulation.\\n\\nTermination.\\n\\nThe simulation concludes in two scenarios: First, it reaches a state of convergence when agents no longer generate actions, indicating a natural end to the narrative. Second, the social modulator may prematurely terminate the simulation if an action from the user agent significantly deviates from the established simulation logic. This termination aids in identifying and understanding the reasons behind the infeasibility of the initial response.\\n\\nPost-simulation, the modulator summarizes its memory, capturing the textual consequence from the simulation. This summary serves as the final output, providing the LLM with insights into the social implications of its responses. This enables the LLM to conduct self-critique and refine its responses for enhanced social awareness and alignment; see a complete simulation example in Appendix 18.\\n\\n3.4.

The findings from Table 14 reveal two key insights:\\n\\ni) Inference Efficiency: Both LLM with MATRIX and MATRIX-Tuned LLM demonstrate superior performance over RAIN in terms of inference efficiency. This improved performance can be attributed to the fact that RAIN's methodology relies on utilizing harmless examples for self-evaluation by the LLM, which in turn expands its input context and complicates the inference process. Additionally, RAIN's approach of employing backtracking to search for suitable tokens further diminishes its inference speed.\\n\\nii) Cost-effective Fine-tuning: By fine-tuning LLMs with MATRIX, we preserve the harmless generation characteristic of the LLM with MATRIX, effectively transforming the LLM into an aligned version that incurs no additional inference time cost. This process not only enhances the model's alignment with desired outcomes but does so without imposing extra time penalties during inference. Note that MATRIX-Tuned LLM takes a slightly longer time than the original LLM to output more comprehensive responses.\\n\\nB.7. Experiments on Mitigating Bias\\n\\nHere we aim to assess MATRIX's effectiveness in diminishing social biases, we conducted an in-depth analysis using the Bias Benchmark for QA (Parrish et al., 2022). This evaluation focused on the model's ability to select the correct, non-stereotypical answers in contexts where ambiguities could lead to biased responses. A key indicator of success in this endeavor is the model's accuracy: higher accuracy reflects a diminished propensity for choosing stereotypical answers.\\n\\nWe evaluated the model's extent of social bias, both before and after MATRIX fine-tuning, with a focus on gender, age, and race. Table 15 showed that the MATRIX-Tuned model was more accurate in choosing unbiased answers, leading to a reduction in social stereotypes. This progress is due to MATRIX's generation of bias-neutral responses to the biased question within the training dataset.\\n\\nC. Prompts and Examples\\n\\nHere we present the prompts used in MATRIX in Table 17. They are all straightforward. Table 18 shows an example of generating scenario-specific with MATRIX. MATRIX creates relevant social roles and enables their interaction, leading to consequence-aware critique.\"}"}

MATRIX addresses this by leveraging role-playing in social scene simulations, enabling LLMs to experience and interpret social feedback from their actions. This process helps LLMs distinguish between socially beneficial and detrimental behaviors, enhancing their potential and achieving self-alignment. Supporting evidence from studies suggests that role designation in LLMs can significantly improve their efficiency in various applications, including tool use and coding tasks (Li et al., 2023; Salewski et al., 2023; Qian et al., 2023).\\n\\nComparison with existing works. MATRIX enhances LLM self-alignment via a self-critique process, prompting LLMs to revise their responses after evaluating self-inferred social consequences. This method, while sharing common ground with other self-critique approaches, is notably distinct from two prevalent methods in the field. First, unlike rule-based systems such as Constitutional AI (Bai et al., 2022b), which relies on abstract rules challenging for LLMs to apply contextually, MATRIX evaluates the potential harm of responses directly. This enables more precise, instruction-specific critiques, effectively guiding LLMs towards generating socially aligned responses. Second, LLM Debate (Du et al., 2023) prioritizes consistency in reasoning tasks, allocating every role the uniform task of responding to the user's inquiry. However, when confronted with complex reasoning questions, all roles fail, causing the debate futile. In comparison, MATRIX highlights multi-party interactions and the consequences of actions in the alignment task, with each role representing a stakeholder in the user's query. Through empathetic role-play, MATRIX steers LLMs towards deeper comprehension, enabling the formulation of socially aligned responses to challenging questions.\\n\\nBesides, our approach to LLM alignment through social feedback is also distinct from methods like Stable Alignment (Liu et al., 2024) which seeks guidance from multiple existing aligned models, while our MATRIX aligns responses by engaging a single unaligned LLM in multiple social roles to achieve positive social outcomes.\\n\\n4. Theoretical Analysis of MATRIX\\n\\nThis section provides a theoretical analysis, which shows that MATRIX enhances LLM's self-alignment by generating better critiques than the human-predefined ones in Constitutional AI's critique-revise method (Bai et al., 2022b).\\n\\nLet $S$ be the set of token sequences, $M: S \\\\rightarrow S$ be a LLM to be aligned. Since both the critique-revise method and LLM with MATRIX are critique-based methods, we provide a general mathematical form for critique-based methods. Given a user's instruction $q$, the output of a critique-based method driven by $M$ is $o = T_M(q)$. Here the critique-based method $T_M(\\\\cdot)$ involves two steps:\\n\\nInitial step. Given a instruction $q$, the model $M$ generates an initial response $r = M(q)$ with the distribution $P(r|q)$.\\n\\nRevise step. Given a critiques $c$, the model $M$ revises the initial response $r$ and outputs $o = M(q, r, c)$ with the distribution $P(o|q, r, c)$.\\n\\nThe randomness of both steps comes from the token-generating process of $M$. Let $T_{CR}M$ denote the critique-revise method and $T_MM$ be the LLM with MATRIX. Both methods share the same initial step. For the revising step, $T_{CR}M$ uses the fixed human predefined critique $c_{CR}$; while $T_MM$ uses the MATRIX-generated critique $c[1:n]$, which is the collection of critiques across all $n$ interactions, adapting to the user's query.\\n\\nLet $O^+ \\\\subseteq S$ be the harmless and helpful token sequences, serving as the alignment target. To enable comparison, we define a partial order $\\\\succeq$ between two method $T_1M$ and $T_2M$.\\n\\nDefinition 4.1. $T_1M$ is defined to be better than $T_2M$ ($T_1M \\\\succeq T_2M$), when $\\\\forall q \\\\in S$, $P_{T_1M}(q) \\\\in O^+ q \\\\geq P_{T_2M}(q) \\\\in O^+ q$.\\n\\n(1)\\n\\nTo analyze the performance of critique-based methods, the key point lies in quantifying the effectiveness of each critique. Here we use the probability of harmless responses, $P(o \\\\in O^+ | q, r, c)$, to represent the effectiveness of each critique, where $o = M(q, r, c)$ stands for using $c$ to revise the response $r$.\\n\\nThen we could describe the critique space as a chain of covering sets.\\n\\nDefinition 4.2. The $\\\\eta$-bounded critique set $C(\\\\eta, q, r)$ is $C(\\\\eta, q, r) = \\\\left\\\\{ c \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R} : P(o \\\\in O^+ | q, r, c) \\\\leq \\\\eta \\\\right\\\\}$.\\n\\n(2)\\n\\nThe set $C(\\\\eta, q, r)$ includes critiques with effectiveness below $\\\\eta$. The $\\\\eta$-efficient complement set $S/C(\\\\eta, q, r)$ describes critiques that could generate aligned output with probability larger than $\\\\eta$.\\n\\nTo capture the performance of a critical $c$ for any instruction, we define its maximum effectiveness.\\n\\nDefinition 4.3. The maximum effectiveness of a critique $c$ is defined as $\\\\xi = \\\\inf \\\\eta \\\\sup q \\\\in S \\\\eta c \\\\in C(\\\\eta, q, M(q))$.\\n\\n(3)\\n\\nBefore we provide our main theorem, we assume that LLM with MATRIX satisfies the following properties.\\n\\nAssumption 4.4. Let $c[1:n] = \\\\{c_i, 1 \\\\leq i \\\\leq n\\\\}$ be the critique generated by MATRIX. Given a instruction $q$, let $o_i = M(q, r, c_i)$ be the output given a single critique $c_i$ and $o = T_MM(q)$ be the output given $c[1:n]$. Then, assume...\"}"}

Experiments\\n\\n5.1. Experimental Setup\\n\\nEvaluation datasets. We adopt 4 representative datasets: HH-RLHF (Bai et al., 2022a) with both helpful and harmful instructions; PKU-SafeRLHF (Ji et al., 2023), covering harmful instructions across 14 categories such as insults and privacy; AdvBench (Zou et al., 2023), covering harmful instructions from 5 topics such as disinformation and toxic; and HarmfulQA (Bhardwaj & Poria, 2023), covering harmful instructions from 10 topics such as social sciences and culture. We also evaluate the tuned model's general abilities on Vicuna-Bench and MT-Bench (Zheng et al., 2023).\\n\\nModels. For the base model, we use Wizard-Vicuna-Uncensored 7/13/30B (TheBloke, 2024b;a; Cognitivecomputations, 2024; Ye et al., 2024) (unaligned). For training, we employ QLoRA (Dettmers et al., 2023; Hu et al., 2021) for 3 epochs. For our SFT step, we use 6K helpful and harmful training data from HH-RLHF dataset, respectively; For simulation, we set up the maximum of roles 4, with max interactions 12; see more experiments on Alpaca (Taori et al., 2023), Mistral (Jiang et al., 2023), and text-davinci-003 in Appendix B.4.\\n\\nBaselines. We compare 11 baselines in total. For evaluating the LLM with MATRIX, we compare with inference-time alignment methods including Self-Alignment (Sun et al., 2023), Context Distillation (Askell et al., 2021), Critique-Revise (Bai et al., 2022b), RAIN (Li et al., 2024) and LLM Debate (Du et al., 2023). For evaluating MATRIX-tuned LLM, we additionally compare with training-time alignment methods including Mistake-Analysis (Chen et al., 2024a), Stable Alignment (Liu et al., 2024), RLcd (Yang et al., 2024) and RLAIF (Bai et al., 2022b). We also compare with approaches with external supervision such as Best-of-N Sampling rated by (OpenAssistant, 2023), ChatGPT (Ouyang et al., 2022) and GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023) Please refer to implementation details in Appendix B.2.\\n\\nEvaluation metrics. We assess the performance of the models using GPT-4 or human as the judger. We randomly choose 100 samples from each evaluation dataset and compare the response between ours and baselines. Specifically, given a question alongside two different responses, the judger will decide the winner or a tie game. For GPT-4 evaluation (Chiang et al., 2023; Khanov et al., 2024), we alternate the order of two responses to avoid position bias (Zheng et al., 2023) and average the results; see details in Table 7). For human evaluations, we randomly recruit 35 volunteers (authors are excluded) to rate the comparison; see details\"}"}

Related Work\\n\\nLLM alignment.\\n\\nAligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human values is essential to minimize potential negative social impacts. RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback) (Ouyang et al., 2022) optimizes LLMs using reward models based on human preferences, while methods like DPO (Rafailov et al., 2023) and RRHF (Yuan et al., 2023) are proposed to alleviate its training instability. Beyond gathering human preferences, strategies for acquiring data from advanced LLMs (Xu et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2024) have been developed. For example, Stable Alignment (Liu et al., 2024) employs GPT feedback for response rating. Researchers have also explored self-aligning LLMs, including self-critique based on social rules (Bai et al., 2022b; Lee et al., 2023), harmless attributes (Yang et al., 2024), learning from harmless examples (Sun et al., 2023; Sun et al., 2024; Lin et al., 2024; Li et al., 2024), and mistake analysis (Chen et al., 2024a). While these methods may struggle to apply predefined social rules to specific scenarios, our approach generates scenario-specific critiques through social impact simulations. This allows the LLM to recognize and correct the harmfulness of its responses, leading to more socially aligned outputs.\\n\\nLLM agent simulation.\\n\\nLLM-driven multi-agent simulations have been utilized for both boosting task efficiency (Chen et al., 2024b) and exploring emergent behaviors (Gao et al., 2023; Zhou et al., 2023). Approaches to enable multi-agent collaboration include developing specific prompting methods (Li et al., 2023; Qian et al., 2023), facilitating debate processes (Du et al., 2023), optimizing communication structures (Chen et al., 2024b; Liu et al., 2023), and integrating operational procedures (Hong et al., 2024). For emergent behaviors, Generative Agents (Park et al., 2023) proposes the architecture of LLM agents, allowing their interaction within a simulated environment. Additionally, research has delved into strategic behaviors (Xu et al., 2023), toxicity and bias (Deshpande et al., 2023; Gupta et al., 2024), collaboration mechanisms (Zhang et al., 2023; Fan et al., 2024b;a), and international conflicts (Hua et al., 2023). While these methods simulate fixed scenarios like towns or software tasks, we focus on authentically simulating any given instruction scenario, which requires action consistency and adaptable communication among agents.\\n\\n7. Conclusions\\n\\nThis paper explores on the self-alignment of LLMs via simulating social scenes. The proposed MATRIX can simulate realistic social interactions and consequences, fostering the development of consequence-aware responses. Fine-tuning on MATRIX-generated data ensures LLM's value alignment while maintaining its inference efficiency. Extensive experiments validate that our method exhibits superior performances in value alignment against 10 baselines on 4 benchmarks. Remarkably, for the first time, in GPT-4 evaluation, our tuned 13B-size LLM can outperform ChatGPT (GPT-3.5-Turbo) across all 4 benchmarks; and 875 human ratings shows that this model can even surpass GPT-4.\\n\\nLimitations.\\n\\nThis work only explores the effective of MATRIX in value alignment. We expect that MATRIX could serve as a general incubator for more comprehensive self-improvement of LLMs, when each role can use tools.\\n\\nAcknowledgements\\n\\nThis research is supported by NSFC under Grant 62171276 and the Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipal under Grant 21511100900 and 22DZ2229005.\\n\\nImpact Statement\\n\\nThis paper aims to advance the field of Machine Learning by proposing a novel method for aligning LLMs with human values. The potential societal benefits of our work include fostering more responsible AI development, enhancing trust in AI technologies, and ensuring AI systems act in ways that are beneficial to society. However, this work also poses ethical challenges and societal consequences that warrant careful consideration. For instance, the accuracy of the simulated social scenes and the model's interpretations of human values could vary, leading to unintended biases. We are committed to ongoing research, dialogue, and collaboration to ensure that our contributions lead to positive outcomes for society.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nSocial constructivism, 2024.

The next lemma discusses the probability of generating such kind of interaction $i_j$.\\n\\nLemma A.5. Let $M$ be an LLM and $\\\\{(i_j, c_j), j \\\\in [N]\\\\}$ is the set of interactions and critiques generated from $T_M$. For any $\\\\epsilon, \\\\delta > 0$, each interaction $i$ falls into the set $T_{\\\\epsilon - \\\\delta}(q, r)$ corresponds to the non-negative probability $P(i \\\\in T_{\\\\epsilon - \\\\delta}(q, r)) > 0$, then $P(\\\\exists i_j, j \\\\in [N], i_j \\\\in T_{\\\\epsilon - \\\\delta}(q, r)) = 1$ when $N \\\\to \\\\infty$. This lemma states that for sufficient large interaction number $N$, there always exist an interaction $i_j$ such that $i_j \\\\in T_{\\\\epsilon - \\\\delta}(q, r)$ if $P(i \\\\in T_{\\\\epsilon - \\\\delta}(q, r)) > 0$. The next lemma proves that this condition is always satisfied for $T_M$ with assumption 4.4.\\n\\nLemma A.6. Let $M$ be an LLM that satisfies the assumption 4.4 with a valid $\\\\lambda$ in (5). Let $T_M$ simulates $N$ steps of interactions. Suppose for $0 < \\\\eta < 1$, if it satisfies the property: $\\sqrt{\\\\eta} < 1 - p_1 - e^{-\\\\lambda}$, then $\\\\exists \\\\delta, 0 < \\\\delta < 1$ such that $0 < P(i \\\\in T_{\\\\eta/\\\\delta - \\\\delta}(q, r)) \\\\leq 1$.\\n\\nA.4.

Analysis and proof to Theorem 4.5\\n\\nAnalysis to Theorem 4.5.\\n\\nThe maximum effectiveness (3) \\\\(\\\\xi_{CR}\\\\) of the critique used in \\\\(T_{CR} M\\\\) is relatively small, making the condition \\\\(\\\\sqrt{\\\\xi_{CR}} < 1 - \\\\sqrt{1 - e^{-\\\\lambda}}\\\\) easy to be satisfied. It can be explained from 2 aspects. 1) Unclear cognitive understanding of alignment goals. Human pre-defined rules and suggestions are highly abstract and concise, which is not a clear instruction for an unaligned model to understand. 2) Hard to balance validity and generalizability. Since \\\\(T_{CR} M\\\\) aims to use a set of unified moral codes to guide the LLM on various kinds of questions, to promote generalizability, the critiques used should be concise and highly summarized. However, this property hinders the revised response from being helpful and question-specific, which is a fundamental conflict of Constitutional AI. The key point of the MATRIX method lies in automatically generating instruction-specific critiques. By utilizing multi-agent social-scene simulation, MATRIX can expose potential harms of the inter-agent interactions and provide additional information on original response distribution. In the process of generating critiques for each interaction, the LLM continually shifts roles and perspectives to generate a set of the most comprehensive and objective critiques of the instruction. The set of critiques that takes all the agents into account will maximally align with social values.\\n\\nThen we provide our proof to Theorem 4.5 based on the assumption and lemmas.\\n\\nProof. Since for LLM \\\\(M\\\\), it satisfies Assumption 4.4 with a valid \\\\(\\\\lambda\\\\) in (5). Then define \\\\(\\\\eta = \\\\xi_{CR}\\\\), apply Lemma A.6, we can find a \\\\(\\\\delta \\\\in [0, 1]\\\\) satisfies\\n\\\\[\\nP_i \\\\in T \\\\eta \\\\delta - \\\\delta(q, r) > 0.\\n\\\\]\\nThen apply Lemma A.5, \\\\(P i_j, j \\\\in \\\\mathbb{N}, i_j \\\\in T \\\\xi_{CR} / \\\\delta - \\\\delta(q, r) = 1\\\\), hence \\\\(T M \\\\geq O^+ T_{CR} M\\\\).\"}"}
