Note that as mentioned in the main body of the paper, we post-processed the security dataset obtained after deploying our automatic pipeline in order to make the dataset more fitting for the fine-tuning task at hand. For this, we downsized samples from overrepresented CWE-language pairs, removed samples for which CodeQL likely made wrong decisions (very minor cases), and added 10 samples for CWE-476, as the samples collected from GitHub lacked sufficient diversity.\\n\\nTesting Scenarios for Code Security\\n\\nIn Tables 7 and 8, we list the scenarios for testing the security of LM-generated code. We also provide a short description for each scenario.\\n\\nHyperparameters and Compute\\n\\nGenerally, we perform instruction tuning for 2 epochs using a learning rate of 2e-5. The only special case is CodeLlama-7B, which is a fine-tuned completion model from Llama2-7B. For CodeLlama-7B, we increase the number of training epochs to 5, and use a higher learning rate (1e-3) following the original paper (Rozi`ere et al., 2023). Moreover, for all LMs, we use batch size 1, accumulate the gradients over 16 steps, and employ the Adam (Kingma & Ba, 2015) optimizer with a weight decay parameter of 1e-2 and \u03f5 of 1e-8. We clip the accumulated gradients to have norm 1.\\n\\nFor LoRA (Hu et al., 2022) fine-tuning, we use an information bottleneck dimension r=16, \u03b1=32, and 0.1 dropout. For both our exploratory and final experiments, we altogether have 3 H100 (80GB) and 8 A100 (40GB) NVIDIA GPUs available.\\n\\nPrompts\\n\\nFor instruction-tuned LMs, we format a pair of instruction-output (i, o) into the prompt template below. We use the same template across all six evaluated LMs.\\n\\nPrompt Template for Instruction-tuned LMs\\n\\nBelow is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\\n\\n### Instruction:\\n\\n{\\\\textit{i}}\\n\\n### Response:\\n\\n{\\\\textit{o}}\\n\\nAll three coding benchmarks considered by us (Security, HumanEval, MBPP) are originally designed for pretrained LMs. The task is to completing a partial program prefix \\\\textit{o}. We follow the same protocol when evaluating the pretrained LMs considered by us. For the evaluation of instruction-tuned LMs, we employ the prompt template shown below. In the instruction part, we provide the expected programming language and a description of the desired functionality. All three benchmarks contains a description for each test sample. We set \\\\textit{o} as the prefix of the response, such that the generated output is in the correct format and is comparable to the results of pretrained LMs. Such a prompt template is widely used in the literature of instruction tuning coding LMs (Wei et al., 2023; Chaudhary, 2023; Luo et al., 2023).\\n\\nPrompt for Coding-related Evaluation\\n\\nBelow is an instruction that describes a task.

We tried formatting question-answering into the instruction prompt above for evaluating instruction-tuned LMs, but it increased the likelihood of incorrect output format. Therefore, we believe that using a completion prompt for all LMs is the most robust and fair evaluation protocol. Note that for TruthfulQA, we shuffle the options, as in the original implementation always the first answer is correct, which could lead to a biased evaluation in a few-shot setting.\"}"}

An essential procedure enabling this adoption is instruction tuning, which substantially enhances LMs' practical utility by training them to follow user instructions and human preferences. However, existing instruction tuning schemes overlook a crucial aspect: the security of generated code. As a result, even the state-of-the-art instruction-tuned LMs frequently produce unsafe code, posing significant security risks. In this work, we introduce SafeCoder to address this gap. SafeCoder performs security-centric fine-tuning using a diverse and high-quality dataset that we collected using an automated pipeline. We integrate the security fine-tuning with standard instruction tuning, to facilitate a joint optimization of both security and utility. Despite its simplicity, we show that SafeCoder is effective across a variety of popular LMs and datasets. It is able to drastically improve security (by about 30%), while preserving utility.\\n\\n1. Introduction\\n\\nModern large language models (large LMs) typically undergo two training stages: pretraining (Brown et al., 2020; Touvron et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023) and instruction tuning (Ouyang et al., 2022; Chung et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2023a). The instruction tuning phase equips the LM with instruction-following and user-interaction capabilities, significantly enhancing their practical usability. Instruction-tuned LMs, such as ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2023a), are increasingly being adopted in daily life and professional environments (Spataro, 2023; Pichai & Hassabis, 2023). A particular strength of these LMs is their proficiency in code understanding. As suggested by Zheng et al. (2023) and Fishkin (2023), programming is the most common use case of state-of-the-art instruction-tuned LMs. Moreover, GitHub has introduced Copilot Chat to assist a variety of software development tasks (Zhao, 2023).\\n\\nBesides improving helpfulness, instruction tuning also aims to ensure safety. While existing instruction tuning schemes have succeeded in improving safety for natural language attributes such as toxicity (Touvron et al., 2023), addressing the security of generated code has received inadequate attention. As a result, even after instruction tuning, LMs still frequently produce insecure code, just like their pretrained versions (Pearce et al., 2022; Li et al., 2023). In Figure 1 (left), we provide an evaluation of four state-of-the-art instruction-tuned LMs, revealing that they generate secure code for only around 60% of the time. In particular, OctoCoder (Muennighoff et al., 2023), despite being tuned with general code commit data, is still prone to generating insecure code frequently. Further detailed results in Appendix B indicate that merely including security-aware instructions in the prompt does not significantly enhance security. The consequences of LM-generated vulnerabilities are worrisome, as they can incur significant resources to fix or even leak into production.\\n\\nKey Challenges\\n\\nDespite the urgent need, mitigating this security concern is not straightforward. The first challenge...\"}"}
{"id": "MgTzMaYHvG", "page_num": 2, "content": "{\"primary_language\":\"en\",\"is_rotation_valid\":true,\"rotation_correction\":0,\"is_table\":false,\"is_diagram\":false,\"natural_text\":\"Instruction Tuning for Secure Code Generation stems from the fact that enhancing security is only one aspect of the overall goal. Equally crucial is the optimization of the LM\u2019s utility across other tasks and human preferences, such as generating functionally correct code (Chen et al., 2021), comprehending natural language (Hendrycks et al., 2021), and ensuring truthfulness (Lin et al., 2022). This dual objective ultimately requires an LM assistant to be both useful and secure.\\n\\nThe second challenge lies in the need for an effective security training dataset. This dataset should consist of programs with accurate security labels and provide a comprehensive coverage of vulnerability types and programming languages. However, obtaining high-quality security datasets is notoriously difficult (Croft et al., 2023).\\n\\nThis Work: SafeCoder\\nWe introduce SafeCoder, a novel approach that addresses the security limitation of LMs during the instruction tuning phase. SafeCoder performs security-specific tuning using a dataset of secure and insecure programs. It guides the LM to generate secure programs through a language modeling loss, while discouraging the generation of unsafe programs using an likelihood loss (Welleck et al., 2020). To provide strong learning signals on security, both loss functions are appropriately masked such that the training focuses on security-critical parts of the programs (He & Vechev, 2023).\\n\\nTo address the first challenge above, SafeCoder mixes the security dataset with a standard instruction tuning dataset, such as those created by Zheng et al. (2023) and Luo et al. (2023). In each training iteration, specific loss functions are employed depending on the origin of the training sample, forming a joint optimization for the objectives specified by the two datasets. In practice, we observe a well-balanced interplay between the two objectives, resulting in a remarkable security-for-free benefit. That is, the resulting LM achieves significantly improved security with negligible sacrifice on utility, when compared to an LM trained solely with standard instruction tuning. We visualize this security-for-free property in Figure 1 (right).\\n\\nFor tackling the dataset challenge, we propose an automated, two-step pipeline for extracting high-quality security datasets from GitHub. The first step, designed to be lightweight, applies heuristics such as keyword matching to select potential vulnerability fixes from hundreds of millions of GitHub commits. In the second step, we invoke more expensive but accurate static analysis (GitHub, 2023) to verify whether the selected commits indeed fix security vulnerabilities. Then, the program before (resp., after) each commit is treated as unsafe (resp., secure).\\n\\nEffectiveness of SafeCoder\\nOur extensive evaluation of SafeCoder covers two popular datasets for standard instruction tuning (Zheng et al., 2023; evo, 2023) and six state-of-the-art LMs. These LMs are either specialized for coding (Li et al., 2023; Rozi`ere et al., 2023) or designed for general-purpose applications (Touvron et al., 2023; Java-heripi & Bubeck, 2023; Jiang et al., 2023). Across a diverse set of 60 testing scenarios, using SafeCoder during instruction tuning yields LMs that reach a secure code generation rate of \u223c90%, surpassing their pretrained versions and their instruction-tuned counterparts without SafeCoder by \u223c30%. Meanwhile, SafeCoder maintains utility over a variety of benchmarks, including HumanEval (Chen et al., 2021), MBPP (Austin et al., 2021), MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2021), and TruthfulQA (Lin et al., 2022).\\n\\nTo benefit the community, we open source our code and datasets. Given the security-for-free advantage, we strongly encourage practitioners to incorporate SafeCoder into their instruction tuning process.\\n\\nMain Contributions\\nOur contributions are outlined as:\\n\u2022 We introduce SafeCoder, a novel instruction tuning method that leads to substantially more secure code generation, without sacrificing utility on other tasks.\\n\u2022 We develop an automated pipeline for collecting security training datasets. Moreover, we share a diverse and high-quality security dataset obtained through our pipeline, along with the corresponding coding scenarios for testing.\\n\u2022 We conduct an extensive experimental evaluation of SafeCoder on a wide range of datasets and LMs, demonstrating the applicability and versatility of the method.\\n\\n2. Related Work\\nLMs for Code Generation\\nLarge LMs, either tailored for coding (Rozi`ere et al., 2023; Nijkamp et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023b) or designed for general applications (Touvron et al., 2023; Jiang et al., 2023; Touvron et al., 2023), exhibit the capability to generate functionally correct code (Chen et al., 2021) and solve competitive programming problems (Li et al., 2022). This profound understanding of code is obtained through pretraining on extensive code corpora. More recently, synthetic coding-specific instructions have been employed to fine-tune pretrained LMs to further enhance their capabilities in functional correctness (Wei et al., 2023; Chaudhary, 2023; Luo et al., 2023).\\n\\nProgram Security\\nAn important aspect of programs is their security.

GitHub CodeQL is an industry-leading static analysis engine for detecting security vulnerabilities (GitHub, 2023). It allows users to write custom queries for specific types of vulnerabilities. It supports mainstream languages and provides queries for common CWEs. Recently, CodeQL has been a popular and reliable choice for evaluating the security of LM-generated code (Pearce et al., 2022; He & Vechev, 2023; Siddiq & Santos, 2022). Therefore, we adopt CodeQL in our work.\\n\\nMany existing vulnerability datasets, including (Fan et al., 2020; Wartschinski et al., 2022), are constructed from vulnerability fix commits, by simply treating pre-commit functions to be vulnerable and post-commit versions as secure. However, revealed in (Croft et al., 2023; He & Vechev, 2023), such categorization leads to wrong security labels, because some code changes can be irrelevant to security. To address this problem, He & Vechev (2023) uses expensive manual inspection to curate their training dataset. In contrast, our work leverages an automated data collection pipeline, resulting in a diverse dataset with broader coverage of CWEs and programming languages.\\n\\nSecurity of LM-generated Code\\n\\nSeveral studies have assessed the security of code generated by pretrained LMs (Li et al., 2023; Pearce et al., 2022; Siddiq & Santos, 2022). These investigations highlight a common finding: all evaluated LMs frequently produce security vulnerabilities. The research conducted by Khoury et al. (2023) focused on the security of ChatGPT, an instruction-tuned LMs. They found that ChatGPT generates code below minimal security standards for 16 out of 21 cases and is only able to self-correct 7 cases after further prompting.\\n\\nAddressing this significant security concern is still an early-stage research topic. The seminal work of SVEN (He & Vechev, 2023) performs incremental training to enhance secure code generation. SafeCoder differs from SVEN in three key aspects. First, SVEN focuses on pretrained code completion models, while SafeCoder targets coding-specific and general-purpose instruction-tuned LMs, which require capabilities in both coding and natural language reasoning. Second, when applied to instruction tuning, SVEN is inherently limited by a trade-off between security and utility. On the contrary, SafeCoder excels in both dimensions. A detailed comparison on this aspect can be found in Section 6.2. The third difference lies in the dataset collection: SVEN relies on manual data curation, while SafeCoder utilizes automatic collection.\\n\\n3. Background and Problem Statement\\n\\nIn this section, we present the necessary background knowledge and outline the problem setting.\\n\\nLanguage Modeling\\n\\nWe consider an autoregressive language model (LM) that handles both natural language and code in the form of text. The LM calculates the probability of a tokenized text $x = [x_1, \\\\ldots, x_L]$ using a product of next-token probabilities:\\n\\n$$P(x) = \\\\prod_{t=1}^{L} P(x_t | x_{<t})$$\\n\\n(1)\\n\\nText can be sampled from the LM in a left-to-right fashion. That is, at step $t$, we sample $x_t$ using $P(x_t | x_{<t})$ and feed $x_t$ to the LM for the next sampling step.\\n\\nPretraining and Instruction Tuning\\n\\nTraining modern LMs requires two key steps: pretraining and instruction tuning. First, LMs are pretrained to predict the next tokens in a large corpus, thereby acquiring the ability to comprehend text syntax and semantics. Then, LMs are fine-tuned to follow task-specific instructions and align with human preferences. Specifically, our work focuses on supervised fine-tuning (Chung et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2023a; Sanh et al.), while considering reinforcement learning (Ouyang et al., 2022) as a future work item.\\n\\nInstruction Tuning for Secure Code Generation\\n\\nOur goal is to address the limitation of existing instruction-tuned LMs in frequently producing unsafe code, as highlighted in Figure 1 (left). While improving security is critical, it is equally important for the enhanced LMs to achieve high utility, such as generating functionally correct code or solving natural language tasks. Therefore, our dual objective involves simultaneously improving security and utility.\\n\\nTo realize this objective, we target the instruction tuning phase, following prior works that prevent LMs from generating other types of harmful content (Bai et al., 2022; Ouyang et al., 2022). This is because instruction tuning an LM is significantly more efficient than pretraining from scratch, both in terms of compute and the number of training samples.\\n\\n4. SafeCoder's Instruction Tuning\\n\\nTo address the challenge of concurrently achieving utility and security, our core idea is to perform a joint optimization on both utility and security demonstrations. Next, we provide a detailed description of our approach.\\n\\nStandard Instruction Tuning\\n\\nLet $D_{std}$ be an instruction tuning dataset, where each sample $(i, o)$ consists of an instruction $i$ to execute a certain task and a desired output $o$.

However, a significant limitation lies in their inadequate emphasis on code security. Next, we discuss how SafeCoder leverages security-specific training to address this issue.\\n\\nSecurity Instruction Tuning\\n\\nSafeCoder utilizes a security dataset $D_{sec}$ consisting of tuples $\\\\langle i, o_{sec}, o_{vul} \\\\rangle$. Each tuple includes an instruction $i$, which specifies the functional requirements of a security-sensitive coding task. $o_{sec}$ and $o_{vul}$ are output programs that accomplish the functionality. While $o_{sec}$ is implemented in a secure manner, $o_{vul}$ contains vulnerabilities. $o_{sec}$ and $o_{vul}$ share identical code for basic functionality, differing only in aspects critical for security.\\n\\nA simple example of $\\\\langle i, o_{sec}, o_{vul} \\\\rangle$ is shown in Figure 2 for illustration purposes. Note that samples in our dataset usually contain more complicated code changes, accounting for approximately 9% of all program tokens on average. In Section 5, we describe how to construct $D_{sec}$ automatically from commits of GitHub repositories.\\n\\nInspired by He & Vechev (2023), our security fine-tuning focuses on the security-related tokens of $o_{sec}$ and $o_{vul}$. Since $o_{sec}$ and $o_{vul}$ differ only in security aspects, security-related tokens can be identified by computing a token-level difference between $o_{sec}$ and $o_{vul}$. We use the Python library difflib (difflib, 2023) to achieve this. Then, we construct a binary mask vector $m_{sec}$, which has the same length as $o_{sec}$. Each element $m_{sec}$ is set to 1 if $o_{sec}$ is a security-related token; otherwise, it is set to 0. A similar vector, $m_{vul}$, is constructed for $o_{vul}$, following the same criteria. Figure 2 showcases examples of $m_{sec}$ and $m_{vul}$.\\n\\nSafeCoder fine-tunes the LM on $o_{sec}$ using a masked negative log-likelihood loss $L_{sec}$ as shown below. $L_{sec}$ is masked by $m_{sec}$ to isolate the training signal only to the security-related tokens. Minimizing $L_{sec}$ increases the probability of tokens that lead to secure code.\\n\\n$$\\nL_{sec}(i, o_{sec}, m_{sec}) = -\\\\sum_{t=1}^{\\\\text{length}(o_{sec})} m_{sec}[t] \\\\cdot \\\\log P(o_{sec}[t]|o_{sec}[<t], i)\\n$$\\n\\nAdditionally, we leverage a masked unlikelihood loss function $L_{vul}$ (Welleck et al., 2020), which penalizes the tokens in $o_{vul}$ that results in insecurity:\\n\\n$$\\nL_{vul}(i, o_{vul}, m_{vul}) = -\\\\sum_{t=1}^{\\\\text{length}(o_{vul})} m_{vul}[t] \\\\cdot \\\\log (1 - P(o_{vul}[t]|o_{vul}[<t], i))\\n$$\\n\\n$L_{vul}$ provides a negative learning signal, in a similar vein to the contrastive loss used in the work of He & Vechev (2023). The key difference is that $L_{vul}$ only involves the current LM, whereas the contrastive loss requires another insecure LM that is unavailable in our context. The utilization of $m_{sec}$ and $m_{vul}$ provides the LM with strong learning signals on the security aspects of training programs. By considering both $o_{sec}$ and $o_{vul}$, the LM benefits from both positive and negative perspectives. In Section 6.2, we experimentally showcase the effectiveness of these components.\\n\\nCombining Standard and Security Tuning\\n\\nWe combine the two schemes in a single training run, as detailed in Algorithm 1. At each iteration, we randomly select a sample $s$ from the combined set of $D_{std}$ and $D_{sec}$ (Line 1).

SafeCoder's Data Collection\\nFor effective security tuning, it is crucial that $D_{sec}$ exhibits both high quality and diversity. Achieving high quality requires accurate security labels for programs $o_{sec}$ and $o_{vul}$. Moreover, $o_{sec}$ and $o_{vul}$ should differ only in security-related aspects, excluding any contamination from unrelated changes such as functional edits and refactorings. For diversity, the dataset should cover a wide range of vulnerabilities and programming languages. Existing datasets are either limited in quality (Wartschinski et al., 2022; Fan et al., 2020; Croft et al., 2023) or diversity (He & Vechev, 2023).\\n\\nIn response to these challenges, we propose an automated pipeline for collecting high-quality and diverse security datasets. Our approach starts with hundreds of millions of GitHub commits and employs a two-step approach to extract fixes for various CWEs in different languages. In the first step, lightweight heuristics, such as keyword matching, are applied to select commits likely to fix vulnerabilities. The second step invokes a more expensive but precise static analyzer to automatically validate vulnerability fixes.\\n\\nAlgorithm Overview\\nOur data collection pipeline is outlined in Algorithm 2. We now give a high-level overview of our pipeline and subsequently present the details of individual components in the following paragraphs. The input is a set of GitHub commits $C = \\\\{(m, r, r')\\\\}$, where $m$ is the commit message, and $r$ and $r'$ denote the two versions of the repositories before and after the commit, respectively. In Line 1, we initialize the dataset $D_{sec}$ to be an empty set. We iterate over the commits and apply lightweight heuristics (represented by heuristicFilter at Line 3) to coarsely identify commits that are likely to fix vulnerabilities. For each selected commit, we leverage the CodeQL static analyzer to check both versions of the repository (Line 4). Then, at Line 5, we verify whether the commit indeed fixes security vulnerabilities, i.e., if the number of vulnerabilities detected by CodeQL is eliminated to zero by the changes in the commit. Upon confirmation, pairs of functions changed in the commit are extracted and treated as $(o_{sec}, o_{vul})$ pairs.\\n\\nNext, at Line 7, we prompt GPT-4 to generate an instruction $i$ that describes the common functionality of $o_{sec}$ and $o_{vul}$. Finally, we add the triple $(i, o_{sec}, o_{vul})$ to $D_{sec}$.\\n\\nHeuristic Commit Filtering\\nheuristicFilter employs two lightweight heuristics to significantly shrink the pool of candidate commits. As a result, we can afford to run the otherwise prohibitively expensive static analysis to obtain accurate security labels. The first heuristic matches the commit message against a list of keywords defined separately for each considered CWE. The second heuristic checks the changes within the commit, excluding unsupported file types and commits that edit too many lines and files. The underlying assumption is that too many changes typically indicate functional edits or refactorings. We set the threshold to 40 lines and 2 files in our experiment.\"}"}

This is represented by the analyzeCode function. A commit is identified as a vulnerability fix, if the pre-commit list of vulnerabilities is non-empty, and the post-commit list is empty. Note that we perform this verification per vulnerability type, resulting in a finer granularity.\\n\\nConstructing Final Samples\\nFor each verified vulnerability fix, we apply the function changedFuncs to extract pairs of functions changed in the commit. We consider the pre-commit version of a pair as vulnerable and the post-commit version as secure, thereby obtaining \\\\((o_{sec}, o_{vul})\\\\).

Then, CodeQL successfully analyzed 25k repositories for the chosen commits. The other repositories could not be analyzed typically due to unresolved library dependencies, which varied case by case. A vulnerability fix could be verified for 4.9% of the successfully analyzed samples, or 1211 samples in absolute terms. Further investigation revealed an overrepresentation of two CWEs. After a final data rebalancing and cleaning step, we arrived at a dataset consisting of 465 high-quality samples in 23 CWE categories and 6 mainstream programming languages. We present details on the exact composition of our collected dataset in Appendix A.\\n\\n6. Experimental Evaluation\\nThis section presents an extensive evaluation of SafeCoder.\\n\\n6.1. Experimental Setup\\nModels\\nWe evaluate SafeCoder on six state-of-the-art open source LMs designed for either coding or general purposes. For coding LMs, we experiment with StarCoder-1B (Li et al., 2023), StarCoder-3B, and CodeLlama-7B (Rozi\u00e8re et al., 2023). For general-purpose LMs, we choose Phi-2-2.7B (Javaheripi & Bubeck, 2023), Llama2-7B (Touvron et al., 2023), and Mistral-7B (Jiang et al., 2023). For the 7B LMs, we use lightweight LoRA fine-tuning (Hu et al., 2022) due to constraints on GPU resources. For other smaller LMs, we always perform full fine-tuning.\\n\\nDataset for Standard Instruction Tuning\\nWe adopt two state-of-the-art open-source datasets for standard instruction tuning. For coding LMs, we use 33K coding-specific samples from evo (2023), an open-source and decontaminated version of Code Evol-Instruct (Luo et al., 2023). For general-purpose LMs, we assemble 18K high-quality samples from LMSYS-Chat-1M, a dataset of real-world conversations with large LMs (Zheng et al., 2023). We select single-round user conversations with OpenAI and Anthropic LMs (OpenAI, 2023c; Anthropic, 2023), the most powerful LMs considered in LMSYS-Chat-1M.\\n\\nEvaluating Utility\\nWe assess utility in two critical dimensions, coding ability and natural language understanding. To measure the models' ability of generating functionally correct code, we leverage two of the most widely adopted benchmarks, HumanEval (Chen et al., 2021) and MBPP (Austin et al., 2021), under a zero-shot setting. We report the pass@1 and pass@10 metrics using temperatures 0.2 and 0.6, respectively. In similar fashion, we evaluate natural language understanding using two common multiple-choice benchmarks, MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2021) and TruthfulQA (Lin et al., 2022). We use 5-shot prompting and greedy decoding for both MMLU and TruthfulQA.\\n\\nDataset for Security Instruction Tuning\\nOur data collection in Section 5 yields 465 samples spanning 23 CWEs and 6 mainstream languages. We also incorporate the dataset from the public repository of He & Vechev (2023) (9 CWEs and 2 languages). We convert it into the instruction tuning format defined in Section 4. The combined dataset consists of 1268 samples that cover 25 CWEs across 6 languages. We randomly split the dataset into 90% for training and 10% for validation. As discussed in Section 4, we oversample minority classes such that all classes have at least \\\\(k\\\\) samples. We set \\\\(k\\\\) to 20 for coding LMs and 40 for general-purpose LMs. A detailed experiment on the selection of \\\\(k\\\\) is presented in Appendix B.\\n\\nEvaluating Code Security\\nFollowing a widely adopted approach (Pearce et al., 2022; Siddiq & Santos, 2022; He & Vechev, 2023), we evaluate the LM's security in code generation with a diverse set of manually constructed coding scenarios. In each scenario, the LM generates code to accomplish certain functionality specified in a prompt. In our experiment, we sample 100 programs to ensure robust results and use temperature 0.4 following He & Vechev (2023). We found that different temperatures do not significantly affect the security of LM trained with SafeCoder. We remove sampled programs that cannot be parsed or compiled. The generated code can be secure or unsafe w.r.t. a target CWE, which is determined by CodeQL. We report the percentage of secure generations.\"}"}

We ensure at least one evaluation scenario for each unique combination of CWE and programming language within our collected training dataset. This results in 42 scenarios. Moreover, we include the 18 testing scenarios from the public repository of He & Vechev (2023). As such, our main evaluation includes a total of 60 distinct scenarios.\\n\\n### 6.2. Experimental Results\\n\\nNext, we present and summarize our experimental results. In Appendix B, we provide more detailed results to facilitate an in-depth understanding of our evaluation.\\n\\n**Main Results**\\n\\nOur main experimental results for coding and general-purpose LMs are presented in Tables 1 and 2, respectively. From these results, we can make several important observations that are consistent across all evaluated LMs. First, all pretrained LMs frequently generate vulnerable code, in line with findings of Li et al. (2023) and He & Vechev (2023). This is because LMs' enormous pretraining set inevitably contains large amounts of unsafe code (Rokon et al., 2020). Second, even after standard instruction tuning (i.e., w/o SafeCoder), the models remain highly insecure. This is because standard instruction tuning lacks mechanisms for addressing security concerns. Crucially, the integration of SafeCoder significantly enhances security. This is particularly valuable, as for the first time, SafeCoder also allows for preserving utility, achieving comparable scores across various utility aspects to standard instruction tuning. Table 9 in Appendix B provides a detailed breakdown of the security results for StarCoder-1B across individual testing scenarios. It demonstrates that SafeCoder achieves an empirical 100% security for most of the scenarios.\"}"}

We then compare these baselines with our complete method, allowing us to assess the usefulness of the omitted components. The comparison is conducted on two LMs: one for coding (StarCoder-1B) and one for general purposes (Phi-2-2.7B). The results are presented in Table 3.\\n\\nTo construct the first baseline \\\"no collected data\\\", we exclude the security dataset collected by us in Section 5. This leads to a reliance solely on He & Vechev (2023)'s training data. The comparison results show that \\\"no collected data\\\" is about 20% less secure than our full method. Moreover, Table 10 in Appendix B provides breakdown results, showing that \\\"no collected data\\\" performs poorly on CWEs not covered by He & Vechev (2023)'s training data.\\n\\nFor the second baseline, we exclude masks $m_{sec}$ and $m_{vul}$ from the loss functions in Equations (3) and (4). As a result, the LM is trained on all tokens of $o_{sec}$ and $o_{vul}$. This change results in about 10% decrease in security when compared to our full method. Therefore, focusing on security-tokens during training is essential for achieving the best security.\\n\\nIn the last ablation study, we do not use the unlikelihood loss in Equation (4) during instruction tuning. This decreases security by 5.1% for StarCoder-1B and 10.6% for Phi-2-2.7B, which highlights the importance of performing negative training on insecure programs.\\n\\nComparisons with Prior Work\\n\\nWe now perform a comprehensive comparison between SafeCoder and SVEN (He & Vechev, 2023). In this experiment, both SafeCoder and SVEN utilize the same dataset to ensure a fair comparison of their respective training methodologies. SVEN's training approach, as adapted to our instruction-tuning setting, involves patching an insecure instruction-tuned LM with incremental security tuning. The insecure instruction-tuned LMs correspond to those trained solely with standard instruction tuning, denoted as \\\"w/o SafeCoder\\\" in Tables 1 and 2. We provide a complete description of how we adapt SVEN's approach in Appendix A.\\n\\nSVEN uses a single loss function consisting of two conflicting objectives (please refer to Equation (6) in Appendix A). On the one hand, SVEN aims to change the LM's behavior for better security, enforced by loss terms $L_{sec}$ and $L_{vul}$. On the other hand, it tries to maintain the LM's original utility, using $L_{KL_{sec}}$ and $L_{KL_{vul}}$ to align the fine-tuned LM's output next-token probabilities with those of the original LM. The effect of the later is weighted by a hyperparameter $w_{KL}$. To explore the impact of varying $w_{KL}$, we set it to $w_{KL} = 2^n/10$, where $n$ varies from 1 to 8, and conduct experiments with these different values.\\n\\nThe results of the comparison are outlined in Figure 3. We observe that SVEN is unable to achieve optimal security and functional correctness at the same time. Instead, as also noted by He & Vechev (2023), there exists a trade-off between the two aspects, due to the conflicting objectives. In contrast, SafeCoder is not limited by such a trade-off and excels at both functional correctness and security. This is because SafeCoder's training procedure in Algorithm 1 leverages a joint optimization for enhancing utility and security simultaneously.\"}"}

However, beyond $k = 20$, further increasing the oversampling parameter provides only diminishing returns.\\n\\nUsefulness of Our Oversampling Strategy\\n\\nAs presented in Section 4, to address the data imbalance in $D_{sec}$ across CWEs and programming languages, we oversample minority classes (language-CWE pairs) with less than $k$ samples to exactly $k$ samples. In Figure 4, we explore the effectiveness of this approach. We run SafeCoder instruction tuning on StarCoder-1B with no oversampling (i.e., $k$ equals 1) and various other $k$ values. Each run is repeated five times with different seeds. Then, we conduct our security evaluation on the trained LMs. Figure 4 displays the mean and standard deviation of the security results, illustrating the impact of different values of $k$. We find that our oversampling scheme is strongly beneficial for both improving security and stabilizing the training by reducing the variance. When $k$ is larger than 20, the return is diminishing. Therefore, for coding LMs, we set $k$ to 20. For general-purpose LMs, we found that setting $k$ to 40 is more beneficial.\\n\\n7. Conclusion and Discussion\\n\\nThis work presented SafeCoder, a novel instruction tuning method for secure code generation. SafeCoder employs a specialized security training procedure that applies a masked language modeling loss on secure programs and an likelihood loss on unsafe code, while conducting standard instruction tuning on non-security-related samples. The security training and standard instruction tuning are combined in a unified training run, allowing for a joint optimization of both security and utility. Moreover, we developed a scalable automated pipeline for collecting diverse and high-quality security datasets. Our extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of SafeCoder over various popular LMs and datasets: it achieves substantial security improvements with minimal impact on utility.\\n\\nLimitations and Future Work\\n\\nSafeCoder is effective for instruction-tuned LMs, which are widely used in practice. However, it currently does not handle pretrained LMs for code completion. SafeCoder also does not address the case of already instruction-tuned LMs, where security vulnerabilities have to be patched post-hoc. We believe that addressing both of these scenarios is a promising and important direction for future work to consider. Furthermore, our work considers supervised fine-tuning. An interesting future work item is extending SafeCoder to the setting of reinforcement learning (Ouyang et al., 2022). Finally, SafeCoder significantly improves the likelihood of generating secure code, which can significantly decrease developers\u2019 efforts on fixing generated vulnerabilities and reduce the risk of these vulnerabilities leaking into production. However, it is important to note that SafeCoder provides no formal guarantee on the security of the generated code.\\n\\nAcknowledgements\\n\\nThis work has received funding from the Swiss State Secretariat for Education, Research and Innovation (SERI) (SERI-funded ERC Consolidator Grant).\\n\\nImpact Statement\\n\\nOur work aims to enhance the security of language models in generating code, thereby contributing positively to the society. We plan to open source our work, enabling a wider audience, including practitioners and LM users, to benefit from our advancements. However, our techniques, if misapplied, could potentially be used to train language models for generating unsafe code. The security evaluation provided in our work can be used to counteract this risk and detect any malicious behavior stemming from the application of our techniques.\"}"}
