For the \u201cself-driving\u201d and \u201ctaxi\u201d modes of transportation, we calculate the \u2018Price\u2019 by multiplying the \u2018Distance\u2019 by factors of 1 and 0.15, respectively. To ensure consistency and reliability of data, we store the search results in our database, thereby creating a fixed dataset for our evaluations.\\n\\nOur restaurant data is sourced from the Kaggle Zomato Restaurants Dataset. From this dataset, we extract the \u201cRestaurant Name\u201d and \u201cAverage Cost\u201d for each establishment. Subsequently, we randomly assign these restaurants to various cities. To align with the constraint requirements of TravelPlanner, we also randomly categorize each restaurant under the following cuisines: \u201cChinese\u201d, \u201cAmerican\u201d, \u201cItalian\u201d, \u201cMexican\u201d, \u201cIndian\u201d, \u201cMediterranean\u201d, \u201cMiddle Eastern\u201d, \u201cKorean\u201d, \u201cAsian\u201d, \u201cFrench\u201d.\\n\\nFor AttractionSearch, we employ the Google Places API to gather information about attractions in each city. In TravelPlanner, we retain essential details such as \u201cName\u201d, \u201cAddress\u201d, \u201cPhone\u201d, \u201cWebsite\u201d, \u201cLatitude\u201d, and \u201cLongitude\u201d for each attraction. To maintain data consistency and reliability, we store these search results in our database, creating a standardized dataset for our analyses.\\n\\nOur accommodation data is obtained from the Kaggle Airbnb Open Data Dataset. From this dataset, we extract key details \u201cNAME\u201d, \u201croom type\u201d, \u201cprice\u201d, \u201cminimum nights\u201d, \u201creview rate number\u201d, and \u201cmaximum occupancy\u201d. Items are then randomly assigned to various cities. To meet the specific constraint requirements of TravelPlanner, we also assign each item random room rules, including \u201cNo parties\u201d, \u201cNo smoking\u201d, \u201cNo children under 10\u201d, \u201cNo pets\u201d, and \u201cNo visitors\u201d.\\n\\nB. Experiment Details\\n\\nB.1. Baselines\\n\\nGreedy Search\\nTo assess the effectiveness of traditional search algorithms in TravelPlanner, we integrate a greedy search approach, focusing on minimizing costs. For 5 or 7-day travel plans, the first one or two cities in the returned city search result are selected as destinations. The transportation choice is based on the lowest cost option among flights, taxis, and self-driving. The diet component involves selecting the restaurant with the lowest average cost. The cheapest accommodation is chosen for lodging. For attractions, we opt for a random selection for each day of the itinerary.\\n\\nPlanning Strategy\\nCurrent planning strategies have shown effectiveness in traditional tasks like mathematical problem-solving, but their capability to handle the more complex and constrained scenarios like TravelPlanner remains to be seen. To explore this, we evaluate four distinct planning strategies on TravelPlanner:\\n\\n1) Direct: In this method, the query is input directly into the model along with instructions detailing the task and relevant information gathered.\\n2) ZS-CoT (Wei et al., 2022): This strategy enhances the reasoning process by requiring intermediate steps. Building on the Direct method, we add the prompt \u201cLet\u2019s think step by step\u201d to elicit reasoning.\\n3) ReAct (Yao et al., 2022): This strategy incorporates environmental feedback into the reasoning process. Thus, it enhances the language agent\u2019s reasoning ability by offering additional information. In TravelPlanner, we provide the cost associated with each entire day\u2019s plan as environmental feedback.\\n4) Reflexion (Shinn et al., 2023): This approach utilizes a reflection model to provide high-level insights on previous erroneous attempts. Such reflective guidance aids language agents in identifying and correcting flawed reasoning.\\n\\nIn order to control the cost, we conduct tests on Direct using four different models, while the other strategies are evaluated using GPT-3.5-Turbo. Detailed instructions for each strategy are available in Appendix B.3.\\n\\nB.2. GPT-4-Turbo with Reflexion strategy in sole-planning mode.\\nWe provide the results of GPT-4-Turbo with Reflexion strategy on validation set in Table B.3.\\n\\n3 https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/distance-matrix/overview?hl=en\\n4 https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shrutimehta/zomato-restaurants-data\\n5 https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/overview?hl=en\\n6 https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arianazmoudeh/airbnbopendata\"}"}

TravelPlanner provides a challenging yet meaningful testbed for future language agents. All the resources are available on the project website.\\n\\n1. Introduction\\n\\nPlanning is a hallmark of human intelligence. It is an evolutionary feat built upon numerous other capacities: using various tools to iteratively collect information and make decisions, recording intermediate plans (in working memory or on a physical device) for deliberation, and exploring alternative plans by running simulations, which in turn depends on a world model (Mattar & Lengyel, 2022; Ho et al., 2022). For decades, researchers have been attempting to develop AI agents to mimic humans' planning capability (Russell & Norvig, 2010; Georgievski & Aiello, 2015; Karpas & Magazzeni, 2020; Lin et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2024), but often in constrained settings (Campbell et al., 2002; Silver et al., 2016; 2017) because many of the cognitive substrates necessary for human-level planning have been lacking. AI agents that can work robustly in the largely unconstrained settings in which humans operate remain a distant goal.\\n\\nThe advent of large language models (LLMs; OpenAI (2022; 2023); Touvron et al. (2023a;b); Jiang et al. (2023)) brings new light to this classic problem. A new generation of language agents (Su, 2023; Sumers et al., 2023; Xie et al., 2023) powered by LLMs has emerged, characterized by their capability of using language as a vehicle for thought and communication. These agents have shown interesting capabilities, such as tool use (Schick et al., 2023; Patil et al., 2023; Qin et al., 2024) and various forms of reasoning (Wei et al., 2022; Yao et al., 2022; Lewkowycz et al., 2022), potentially fulfilling the role of some of the cognitive substrates that were lacking in earlier AI agents. Researchers have therefore investigated their potential in an array of planning tasks ranging from classic planning settings like Blocksworld (Valmeekam et al., 2023) to embodied agents (Huang et al., 2022; Ichter et al., 2022; Song et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023) and web agents (Deng et al., 2023; Zhou et al., 2024). However, the planning settings in existing work still largely follow the conventional setting that focuses on single-objective optimization with fixed ground truths. An agent is tasked with predicting from a predefined set of actions, just now made by an LLM-powered agent.\\n\\nAre language agents capable of planning in more complex yet realistic settings, closer to those in which humans operate?\\n\\nTo advance this investigation, we propose TravelPlanner, a new planning benchmark that focuses on a common real-world planning scenario\u2014travel planning.

Overview of TravelPlanner. Given a query, language agents are tasked with employing various search tools to gather information. Based on the collected information, language agents are expected to deliver a plan that not only satisfies the user's needs specified in the query but also adheres to commonsense constraints.\\n\\nPlanning a multi-day itinerary is inherently long-horizon, involving a large number of interdependent decisions on places, lodging, transportation, dining, etc. Travel planning involves many constraints, ranging from explicit constraints such as budget and various user needs to implicit commonsense constraints, e.g., people cannot teleport to another city without using some means of transportation. Travel planning requires strong agency to proactively acquire necessary information using various tools (e.g., to search flights and restaurants) from the partially observable environment and deliberate over the collected information to further the planning while being mindful of all the explicit and implicit constraints. Planning tasks of such complexity are out of the reach of prior AI agents (Russell & Norvig, 2010).\\n\\nTravelPlanner provides a rich sandbox environment with around four million data entries crawled from the Internet that can be accessed via six tools. We also meticulously curate 1225 diverse user queries (along with their reference plans), each imposing a different combination of constraints. A representative example is illustrated in Figure 1.\\n\\nWe comprehensively evaluate five LLMs, such as GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023), Gemini (G Team et al., 2023), and Mixtral (Jiang et al., 2024), and four planning strategies, such as ReAct (Yao et al., 2022) and Reflexion (Shinn et al., 2023), on their capability of delivering complete plans and following constraints. The main findings are as follows:\\n\\n\u2022 State-of-the-art LLMs cannot handle complex planning tasks like those in TravelPlanner. GPT-4 successfully produces a plan that meets all the constraints for a few tasks (0.6%), while all other LLMs fail to complete any tasks.\\n\u2022 Existing planning strategies such as ReAct and Reflexion, which may be effective for simpler planning settings, are insufficient for the multi-constraint tasks in TravelPlanner. They often fail to convert their reasoning into the right actions and to keep track of global or multiple constraints. Language agents need more sophisticated planning strategies to approach human-level planning.\\n\u2022 Further analyses reveal many common failure modes of existing language agents, such as argument errors in tool use, being trapped in dead loops, and hallucinations. Although most of our findings lean negatively toward the current language agents, we should note that the mere possibility for an artificial agent to tackle such a complex task is non-trivial progress in itself. TravelPlanner provides a challenging yet meaningful testbed for future agents to hill-climb toward human-level planning in complex settings.\\n\\nFinally, a silver lining: while our well-trained human annotators averagely take 12 minutes to manually annotate a plan, a language agent can produce a plan in just 1\u20132 minutes automatically. Perhaps one day, language agents will become capable enough to help automate away many of such tedious tasks for us.\"}"}

Related Work\\n\\n2.1. Large Language Model based Agents\\n\\nEmpowered by large language models (LLMs), language agents have the capability to decompose complex tasks and arrive at solutions through a series of reasoned actions. Notable examples such as AutoGPT (AutoGPT, 2023), BabyAGI (Nakajima, 2023), and HuggingGPT (Shen et al., 2023) have illuminated the community with their impressive abilities. Current LLM-powered language agents, equipped with Memory, Tool-use, and Planning modules, have seen a substantial improvement in their general abilities (Weng, 2023). Memory in language agents refers to their ability to acquire and process information. It is divided into two types: long-term memory, which is the parametric memory inherent in LLMs, and short-term memory, also known as in-context learning (Brown et al., 2020) or working memory. Techniques like memory summarization (Chen et al., 2023; Zhou et al., 2023; Liang et al., 2023) and retrieval (Andreas, 2022; Park et al., 2023; Zhong et al., 2023) are widely employed to enhance the memory capabilities of language agents. Moreover, by interacting with external tools, language agents expand their potential capabilities significantly. This tool-augmentation paradigm has been validated as effective in previous work (Nakano et al., 2021; Lu et al., 2023; Ge et al., 2023; Xie et al., 2023). We further discuss the planning module in Section 2.2.\\n\\n2.2. Planning\\n\\nPlanning, a hallmark of human intelligence, entails a sequence of actions that involve decomposing tasks, searching for solutions, and making final decisions (Hayes-Roth & Hayes-Roth, 1979; Grafman et al., 2004; Su, 2023). This skill is crucial for achieving human-level intelligence and has been widely studied in areas such as robotics (McDermott, 1992; Alterovitz et al., 2016) and transportation scheduling (Cross & Estrada, 1994; Pinedo, 2005). The emergence of language agents powered by LLMs has further intensified discussions around their planning capabilities (Liu et al., 2023a; Valmeekam et al., 2023). Previous research has demonstrated that language agents can effectively decompose tasks and engage in step-by-step reasoning, leading to significant improvements (Wei et al., 2022; Yuan et al., 2023; Zheng et al., 2024). Furthermore, to optimize solution searches in fewer steps, classical data structures like trees and graphs have been employed in prior studies (Yao et al., 2023; Besta et al., 2023), enhancing the planning capabilities of language agents. In addition, methods involving feedback from the environment (Yao et al., 2022; Shinn et al., 2023) have also been shown to be beneficial. However, while these planning abilities have shown promise in specific tasks, the effectiveness of these planning strategies in scenarios with multiple constraints remains uncertain.\\n\\n2.3. Evaluation of Language Agents\\n\\nPrevious studies typically assess LLM-powered language agents in focused domains: arithmetic reasoning targeting correct solutions (Roy & Roth, 2015; Cobbe et al., 2021; Patel et al., 2021); tool-use evaluating agents' proficiency in employing tools and reporting results (Li et al., 2023; Xu et al., 2023; Zhuang et al., 2023); and web navigation, testing agents' ability to locate specific websites (Deng et al., 2023; Zhou et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2024). However, the complexity of the real-world implies that previous evaluation methods, which focus on single objective and fixed ground truths, may fall short of capturing the full scope of agents' capabilities. To address this, we introduce TravelPlanner for comprehensive evaluations, assessing whether language agents can generate feasible solutions facing various objectives, referred to as constraints in this paper.\\n\\n3. TravelPlanner\\n\\n3.1. Overview\\n\\nWe introduce TravelPlanner, a benchmark crafted for evaluating language agents in tool-use and complex planning within multiple constraints. Grounding to travel planning, a real-world use-case that naturally includes diverse constraints such as user needs and commonsense constraints, TravelPlanner evaluates whether agents can develop flexible travel plans by collecting information via diverse tools and making decisions while satisfying the constraints.\\n\\nTravelPlanner comprises 1225 queries in total. The queries in TravelPlanner are divided into nine groups. This classification is based on two criteria: the duration of travel and the number of hard constraints. The dataset is divided into the training, validation, and test set. The training set includes 5 queries per group with human-annotated plans (45 pairs in total), the validation set includes 20 queries per group (180 in total), and the test set includes 1000 queries. Detailed distributions are shown in Table A.1.\\n\\n3.2. Constraint Introduction\\n\\nIn order to assess whether agents can perceive, understand, and satisfy various constraints to formulate a feasible plan, as outlined in Table 1, we include three types of constraints:\\n\\n- Environment Constraints: The real-world is dynamic, necessitating agents to be adaptable. For instance, flights to a particular destination may be unavailable at certain times (e.g., no flights from Seattle to San Francisco in Figure 1), possibly because tickets are sold out. In such cases, the agent must dynamically seek an alternative, like changing the destination of the flight or the way of transportation. To simulate this, we introduce environment constraints within TravelPlanner to test the adaptability of agents in planning.\"}"}

For instance, repeatedly visiting the same attraction is not typical. To evaluate agents' understanding and utilization of commonsense during planning, we include the commonsense constraint in TravelPlanner.\\n\\n- **Hard Constraints**: A crucial ability for agents is to effectively satisfy personalized user needs. To evaluate this, TravelPlanner incorporates various user needs, such as budget constraints. These user needs are termed hard constraints. The hard constraint measures the agent's generalization ability with regard to different user needs.\\n\\n**3.3. Benchmark Construction Pipeline**\\n\\nThis section outlines the construction pipeline of TravelPlanner, which involves the following steps:\\n\\n1. **Environment and evaluation setup.**\\n2. **Diverse travel query design.**\\n3. **Reference plan annotation.**\\n4. **Quality check.**\\n\\n**Environment Setting.** In TravelPlanner, we create a static and closed sandbox environment for consistent and unbiased evaluations. This setup ensures that all agents access the same unchanging information from our static databases, avoiding the variability and potential biases introduced by dynamic data. To offer various travel options that align with the real-world, we ensure the database for each tool in TravelPlanner contains rich information. The database size of each tool is listed in Table 2. For more tool details, please refer to Appendix A.2 and A.3. Additionally, agents are instructed to use the \\\"NotebookWrite\\\" tool to record necessary information for planning. This tool is integrated to evaluate agents' working memory management and prevents maximum token limit caused by context accumulation.\\n\\n**Query Construction.** To create diverse queries for TravelPlanner, we begin with several fundamental elements, including departure city, destination, and specific date range, randomly chosen to form the skeleton of each query. Subsequently, we adjust the duration of travel and the number of hard constraints to create different levels of complexity. The duration of the travel\u20143, 5, or 7 days\u2014determines the number of cities included in the plan. Specifically, 3-day plans focus on one city, while 5 days and 7 days involve visiting one randomly chosen state, with trips to 2 cities for the 5-day plans and 3 cities for the 7-day plans, respectively. A greater number of days requires more frequent tool usage by language agents, thus increasing the difficulty of managing the long-horizon aspect of planning. The uncertain destination challenges agents to decide on multiple cities, where they must consider factors such as inter-city connectivity.\"}"}

Some of the data in the TravelPlanner environment is derived from publicly available data on the Internet, and the content involved does not represent the authors' viewpoints. We realize that everyone's definition of commonsense may be different. Our current evaluation criteria are based on the authors' consensus, and we encourage additional discussions to enrich our commonsense dimension, aiming for a more thorough evaluation. We have released our evaluation scripts to foster innovation and aid the development of new methods. We encourage the use of evaluation feedback in training set, such as implementing reinforcement learning techniques, to enhance learning. However, we strictly prohibit any form of cheating in the validation and test sets to uphold the fairness and reliability of the benchmark's evaluation process.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nAlterovitz, R., Koenig, S., and Likhachev, M.

{"id": "l5XQzNkAOe", "page_num": 5, "content": "{\"primary_language\":\"en\",\"is_rotation_valid\":true,\"rotation_correction\":0,\"is_table\":false,\"is_diagram\":false,\"natural_text\":\"Furthermore, we introduce diverse user needs as hard constraints to add further complexity and realism. The difficulty levels are categorized as follows:\\n\\n- **Easy**: Queries at this level are primarily budget-constrained for a single person. The initial budget for each query is determined using a set of crafted heuristic rules.\\n\\n- **Medium**: In addition to budget constraints, medium queries introduce an additional hard constraint, randomly selected from a constraint pool including cuisine type, room type, and room rule. Furthermore, the number of people varies between 2 and 8, which influences the calculation of costs for both transportation and accommodation.\\n\\n- **Hard**: Hard queries include additional transportation preference into the constraint pool, along with all the constraints in medium queries. Each hard query contains three hard constraints randomly selected from the constraint pool.\\n\\nThis method ensures the diversity of queries. Minor changes in these elements can lead to significantly different plans. Finally, based on elements, we utilize GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023) to generate natural language queries.\\n\\n**Human Annotation.** To ensure every query has at least one feasible plan, we invite 20 graduate students to meticulously annotate plans for synthesized queries. One plan is deemed eligible only if it meets all the constraints outlined in our evaluation script, which is detailed in Section 3.4. This rigorous process resulted in the creation of 1225 validated query-plan pairs. We pay annotators an average of $0.80 for each plan they annotate.\\n\\n**Quality Control.** To ensure the quality of each natural language query and its corresponding annotated plan, the authors performed a detailed review of every query and plan, rectifying any errors found. Additionally, to ensure the challenges, we re-calibrate each query's budget using the costs from corresponding human-annotated plans. This approach replaces the initial heuristic-generated budgets, which might be too high, thus reducing the number of feasible plans. Through multiple stages of human verification, we ensure the high quality of each query in TravelPlanner and the presence of at least one feasible solution.\\n\\n### 3.4. Evaluation\\n\\nTo ensure a comprehensive evaluation of the plans offered by agents, we assess them from multiple dimensions. Specifically, we first extract key components, including transportation, restaurants, attractions, and accommodations, which are initially presented as natural language. These components are then organized into a formally structured plan, which will be evaluated automatically through pre-defined scripts. The evaluation criteria include the following:\\n\\n- **Delivery Rate**: This metric assesses whether agents can successfully deliver a final plan within a limited number of steps. Falling into dead loops, experiencing numerous failed attempts, or reaching the maximum number of steps (30 steps in our experimental setting) will result in failure.\\n\\n- **Commonsense Constraint Pass Rate**: Comprising eight commonsense dimensions, this metric evaluates whether a language agent can incorporate commonsense into their plan without explicit instructions.\\n\\n- **Hard Constraint Pass Rate**: This metric measures whether a plan satisfies all explicitly given hard constraints in the query, which aims to test the agents' ability to adapt their plans to diverse user needs.\\n\\n- **Final Pass Rate**: This metric represents the proportion of feasible plans that meet all aforementioned constraints among all tested plans. It serves as an indicator of agents' proficiency in producing plans that meet a practical standard.\\n\\nWe do not separately assess environment constraints since their impact is inherently reflected in the \\\"Within Sandbox\\\" and \\\"Complete Information\\\" metrics. For instance, when cities lack transportation or attractions, agents typically resort to hallucination or opt not to provide an answer, reflecting the impact of environment constraints.\\n\\nFor the Commonsense Constraint Pass Rate and Hard Constraint Pass Rate, we utilize two evaluation strategies: micro and macro. The micro strategy calculates the ratio of passed constraints to the total number of constraints. The Micro Pass Rate is defined as:\\n\\n$$\\\\text{Micro Pass Rate} = \\\\frac{\\\\sum_{p \\\\in P} \\\\sum_{c \\\\in C_p} \\\\text{passed}(c, p)}{\\\\sum_{p \\\\in P} |C_p|}$$\\n\\nwhere $P$ represents the set of all plans being evaluated, $C_p$ denotes the set of constraints applicable to a specific plan $p$ in $P$, and passed is a function determining whether $Y$ meets constraints $X$.\\n\\nThe macro strategy calculates the ratio of plans that pass all commonsense or hard constraints among all tested plans. We define the Macro Pass Rate as:\\n\\n$$\\\\text{Macro Pass Rate} = \\\\frac{\\\\# \\\\{ p \\\\in P : 1_{\\\\text{passed}(C_p, p)} \\\\} }{|P|}$$\\n\\nThese two metrics evaluate an agent's capability of following individual constraints vs. all the constraints holistically.\\n\\n### 3.5.

Experiments\\n\\nWe evaluate the performance of various LLMs and planning strategies on TravelPlanner. In the two-stage mode, we use the ReAct (Yao et al., 2022) framework for information collection, which is recognized for its effective iteration with tools (Zhuang et al., 2023) while varying the foundation LLMs. This approach allows us to assess how different LLMs perform under a uniform tool-use framework. The agents are required to give the plan directly based on the information collected by themselves, without employing any other planning strategies. In the sole-planning mode, our evaluation goes beyond varying LLMs to include different planning strategies. This aims to assess if the strategies proven effective in other planning benchmarks maintain their efficacy in TravelPlanner. All experiments are conducted in a zero-shot setting.\\n\\n4.1. Baselines\\n\\nGreedy Search. To evaluate the effectiveness of traditional rule-based strategies within TravelPlanner, we include greedy search as a baseline and set cost as the optimization objective. Please refer to Appendix B.1 for more details.\\n\\nLLMs. Due to the long context window requirement of ReAct and the massive information as text, we limit our consideration to LLMs capable of handling inputs exceeding 8K in length. As a result, our selection includes three closed-source LLMs: GPT-3.5-Turbo (OpenAI, 2022), GPT-4-Turbo (OpenAI, 2023), and Gemini Pro (G Team et al., 2023), as well as two open-source LLMs: Mistral-7B-32K (Jiang et al., 2023) and Mixtral-8x7B-MoE (Jiang et al., 2024). For all these models, we adopt the official instruction formats whenever available.\\n\\nPlanning Strategies. To explore the effectiveness of current planning strategies, we evaluate four representative ones: Direct, ZS-CoT (Wei et al., 2022), ReAct (Yao et al., 2022), and Reflexion (Shinn et al., 2023). For the implementation details, please refer to Appendix B.1. We do not include ToT (Yao et al., 2023) and GoT (Besta et al., 2023) because they require extensive exploration of the search space, prohibitively costly for problems as complex as TravelPlanner. Also, given their performance close to ReAct in complex tasks (Zhuang et al., 2024), the potential benefits of these methods may be limited.\\n\\n4.2. Main Results\\n\\nIn this section, we discuss the performance of various LLMs and planning strategies on TravelPlanner (Table 3). We have the following observations:\\n\\nTravelPlanner poses a significant challenge. In the two-stage mode, GPT-4-Turbo with ReAct achieves only 0.6% in the final pass rate, and none of the other LLMs can pass any...\"}"}

An early stop will be triggered if the agent either makes three consecutive failed attempts or repetitive actions, indicating a dead loop.\\n\\nEven given all the necessary information in the sole-planning mode, existing planning strategies like ReAct and Reflexion still struggle with planning in TravelPlanner, even though they have shown their effectiveness in more conventional planning tasks. It is noteworthy that the best-performing agent still falls short on hard constraints even when compared to greedy search. This poor performance underlines the difficulty of TravelPlanner and shows that current agents still struggle with complex planning.\\n\\nAgents show a substantial gap between the two modes. The comparison of the two modes reveals the agents' struggles in fiddling with both information collection and planning. Across all metrics, the scores of any model in the two-stage mode are lower than those in the sole-planning mode, with the largest gap reaching over 30%. Similar to humans, language agents also seem to have a limited \\\"cognitive capacity\\\" and their performance deteriorates when multitasking. We provide a further analysis in Section 5.2.\\n\\nAgents struggle in obtaining a high macro pass rate. While some agents achieve high micro scores, their macro scores remain low. This pattern shows that although agents manage to satisfy some constraints, they often overlook some other constraints in the meantime. Consequently, this indicates the current agents fail to consider multiple constraints holistically, a critical requirement for navigating the complex tasks in TravelPlanner.\\n\\nIn summary, TravelPlanner poses a great challenge to current agents. The SoTA LLMs and planning strategies, which often show equal or superior to human-level performance on many traditional tasks, are still far from sufficient for complex planning tasks that humans are capable of. TravelPlanner provides a challenging yet meaningful benchmark for the development of more capable language agents.\\n\\n5. In-Depth Analysis\\n5.1. Tool-Use Error Analysis\\nAs shown in Table 3, even based on GPT-4-Turbo, agents still make mistakes in the process of information collection and thus fail to deliver a plan. This problem is more severe in Gemini Pro and Mixtral. To delve into the underlying causes, we categorize all error types in Figure 2.

Case Studies\\n\\nTo investigate the drawbacks of current agents in-depth, we provide several failure cases in Figure 3. We conclude with the following features:\\n\\nAgents fail to complete a plan due to the inability to rectify persistent errors. In tool-use scenarios, agents often fail to deliver a plan even when all preceding steps are executed correctly. Further investigation reveals that this issue often stems from incorrect date inputs. As shown in the left part of Figure 3, despite correct execution, agents repeatedly use incorrect dates. This leads to null results, as the data in the TravelPlanner sandbox is based on 2022. Such repeated failures eventually cause the agents to stop planning. This indicates a significant limitation: current agents cannot self-correct their initial and incorrect assumptions.\\n\\nAgents produce hallucinatory answers due to information confusion. To understand why agents provide hallucinatory answers even when supplied with sufficient information in the sole-planning mode, we conduct a detailed analysis. We observe a tendency for agents to confuse one piece of information with another. As shown in the middle part of Figure 3, agents mistakenly use the same flight number for both departure and return flights. Such errors result in hallucinations, as the information provided in the plan does not align with the data in the sandbox. This suggests that agents might be lost when faced with mass information, known as \u201cLost in the Middle\u201d (Liu et al., 2023b).\\n\\nAgents struggle to align their actions with their reasoning. To understand the reasons behind the lower delivery rate of Reflexion (Shinn et al., 2023), we examine specific examples. As illustrated in the right part of Figure 3, we observe a discrepancy between what agents think and what they do. Despite recognizing the necessity to minimize costs, they tend to randomly select items, some of which may be more expensive. This discrepancy demonstrates that agents struggle to synchronize their actions with their analytical reasoning, severely impeding their delivery rate.\\n\\n6. Conclusion\\n\\nWe introduce TravelPlanner, a benchmark grounded in real-world scenarios, designed to assess the multi-constraint planning and tool-use abilities of current language agents. Our benchmark presents a significant challenge: even the most advanced language agent frameworks only achieve\"}"}
