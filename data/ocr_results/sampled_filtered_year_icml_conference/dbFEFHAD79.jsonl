However, assessing the utility of MLLMs presents considerable challenges, primarily due to the absence of multimodal benchmarks that align with human preferences. Drawing inspiration from the concept of LLM-as-a-Judge within LLMs, this paper introduces a novel benchmark, termed MLLM-as-a-Judge, to assess the ability of MLLMs in assisting judges across diverse modalities, encompassing three distinct tasks: Scoring Evaluation, Pair Comparison, and Batch Ranking. Our study reveals that, while MLLMs demonstrate remarkable human-like discernment in Pair Comparison, there is a significant divergence from human preferences in Scoring Evaluation and Batch Ranking. Furthermore, a closer examination reveals persistent challenges in the judgment capacities of LLMs, including diverse biases, hallucinatory responses, and inconsistencies in judgment, even in advanced models such as GPT-4V. These findings emphasize the pressing need for enhancements and further research efforts to be undertaken before regarding MLLMs as fully reliable evaluators. In light of this, we advocate for additional efforts dedicated to supporting the continuous development within the domain of MLLM functioning as judges. The code and dataset are publicly available at our project homepage: https://mllm-judge.github.io/.\\n\\n1. Introduction\\n\\nThe advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT-3 (OpenAI, 2023) and Llama (Touvron et al., 2023), has achieved substantial progress in content generation, including text generation (OpenAI, 2023), code generation (Roziere et al., 2023), and video synthesis (Wu et al., 2023a). The emergent abilities of LLMs, as demonstrated by the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) framework (Wei et al., 2022), present a promising avenue for their utilization as evaluators, also referred to as the LLM-as-a-Judge (Zheng et al., 2023b). Initial explorations indicate a better alignment with human preferences, emphasizing the considerable potential inherent in this approach.\\n\\nRecently, building upon LLMs, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) like GPT-4V (OpenAI, 2023) and LLaV A (Liu et al., 2023d) exhibit exceptional proficiency by incorporating multiple modalities (e.g., text, charts, images, and videos) and showcasing remarkable performance in multimodal applications, including text-to-video (Wu et al., 2023a) and visual dialog (Cai et al., 2023). Despite this, assessing the effectiveness of MLLMs remains challenging due to the limitations of traditional metrics, which hinge on text-based exact matches or embedding distances. These metrics fall short in adhering to the granular evaluation criteria of interest and fail to capture the rich context within the generated outputs. Drawing inspiration from the concept of LLM-as-a-Judge within LLMs, a pertinent research question arises: \u201cCan MLLMs effectively serve as judges in the multimodal domain, and how closely do their evaluations align with human preferences?\u201d\\n\\nTo answer this question, this paper undertakes an extensive study, introducing a groundbreaking benchmark, MLLM-as-a-Judge, specifically crafted to evaluate the efficacy of MLLMs in assisting judges across diverse modalities. To achieve this goal, we first thoughtfully curate a selection of 14 datasets across various tasks, including image captioning, math reasoning, text reading, and infographics understanding, culminating in acquiring a dataset comprising 4,414 image-instruction pairs. Subsequently, we utilize six main-stream MLLMs from a model pool which includes GPT-4V.\"}"}

Comparative performance of different MLLMs across three judging settings in 10 datasets, each is the average of three iterations. As the CogVLM is unable to perform the batch ranking task, we show the other six MLLMs only.\\n\\nAs a benchmark, we also release two curated datasets to facilitate further studies: MLLM-AS-A-JUDGE-HQ, which showcases responses with a high level of concordance with human judgments, and MLLM-AS-A-JUDGE-HARD, which includes responses marked by inconsistency with human preferences and instances of hallucination. Additionally, we address the limitations of MLLMs in judgment, such as egocentric bias, position bias, length bias, and hallucination. We demonstrate that integrating CoT (Wei et al., 2022) and a vision expert system can effectively mitigate some of these biases.\\n\\n1 For conciseness, we refer to GPT-4V(ision) as GPT-4V, and Gemini-Pro-Vision as Gemini throughout this paper.\\n\\nTake-Aways. We evaluate the judgment performance of 11 MLLMs across 14 datasets under three settings: score evaluation, pair comparison, and batch ranking. Our findings reveal several key insights. First, while MLLMs demonstrate proficiency in aligning with human preferences in pair comparison tasks, they require further improvement in score evaluation and batch ranking, particularly in reasoning tasks. Secondly, GPT-4V consistently outperforms other models across all tasks and settings. Finally, the presence of hallucinations, biases, and inconsistent judgments in MLLMs highlights significant challenges that must be addressed for these models to become a viable alternative to traditional human evaluations.\\n\\nTo summarize, our work provides three key contributions:\\n\\n\u2022 A Benchmark. We are the first to develop a comprehensive benchmark MLLM-as-a-Judge in multimodal domains, with human annotations to assess the judging capability of MLLMs in tasks of Scoring Evaluation, Pair Comparison and Batch Ranking.\\n\\n\u2022 Two Datasets. We curate two human preference datasets: MLLM-AS-A-JUDGE-HQ, which contains high-quality questions, and MLLM-AS-A-JUDGE-HARD, which includes instances of hallucination. These datasets can serve as rigorous testing grounds to facilitate the development of MLLMs in aligning human preferences.\\n\\n\u2022 Findings and Implications. Our evaluation of mainstream MLLMs reveals that while MLLMs exhibit alignment with human judgments in Pair Comparison, notable discrepancies can be found in Scoring Evaluation and Batch Ranking. Furthermore, our findings reveal that MLLMs exhibit a range of biases and hallucinations, along with inconsistent judgments during the evaluation process, representing significant hurdles in establishing MLLMs as reliable judges.\"}"}

Gemini-Vision-Pro as Judge\\n\\nWe call Gemini\u2019s API on the Google Cloud Server and use the default settings for temperature and top-k. It should be noted that even though Gemini is currently the only VLM that can perform Judge, it will occasionally speak Chinese or Japanese during the output process when using English text and English pictures, shown as Unicode in Figure 9. Although it is semantically continuous, that is, it can be used after translation, and it greatly affects the continuity of the judge. We believe that this is a capability issue, and it is speculated that it is affected by the multi-linguist in some training sets.\\n\\nC.4. Other MLLMs as Judge\\n\\nWe also use other mainstream MLLMs such as CogVLM (Wang et al., 2023c) and LLaV A (Liu et al., 2023d) for judging, which hyper-parameters follow the response generation settings. Some issues arise when we use the basic \u201cAnalyze-then-Judge\u201d setting, where they cannot follow the judging instructions very well. Therefore we do not put their results into the results of the text. Recently, we have also noticed the advent of GLM-4V 2, which has shown good performance on some benchmarks and can receive long-term text and follow the instructions for judging. However, due to the time constraints, we have not completed tests on GLM-4V in our work.\\n\\n---\\n\\n2 https://open.bigmodel.cn/\"}"}

Beyond analyzing GPT-4V and Qwen-vl-max, we explored Video-LLM's judging capabilities, specifically testing it with ChatUnivi. As illustrated in Table 10 for Batch Evaluation, Pair Comparison, and Score Evaluation respectively, our findings indicate that GPT-4V significantly outperforms other models on sequential data. Despite the high-quality responses generated by the Video-LLM ChatUnivi we evaluated, it fundamentally lacks the judging capability and consistency.\"}"}

Preliminary Experiment\\n\\nHuman Agreement on GPT-4V Output Mode.\\n\\nThe recently introduced 'Json Mode' in GPT-4V represents a significant advancement, particularly in structuring outputs in JSON format while restricting token usage. This mode has been observed to regularize responses, a feature particularly advantageous when dealing with structured data. However, this structuring tends to compartmentalize responses, potentially leading to a loss in the natural flow and contextual linkage typically inherent in human-like responses. This segmentation might inadvertently affect the readability and perceived coherence of the generated text.\\n\\nTo quantitatively assess the impact of Json Mode on output quality and its alignment with human preferences, we meticulously construct a test set. This set comprises 50 data instances, randomly selected from three distinct datasets used for evaluation purposes. The objective is to discern human evaluators' predilection for the outputs generated in Json Mode by GPT-4V.\\n\\nFor a comprehensive analysis, we engage three annotators, each responsible for labeling the data. Their assessments aim to discern the balance between structured, JSON-formatted responses and the inherently fluid nature of human judgment and preference in textual content, as shown in Figure 12.\\n\\nHuman Agreement on GPT-4V Output Mode:\\n\\nAcknowledging the inherent variability in human annotations, we embark on an empirical study involving ten annotators to ascertain the reliability of derived statistical patterns, notwithstanding the subjective nature of human judgment. This study aims to mitigate the individual biases that might skew the evaluation of GPT-4's outputs. A dataset comprising 50 entries, processed using the GPT-4 pair comparison setting, serves as the foundation for this investigation.\\n\\nThe results, detailed in Figure 13, underscore a noteworthy observation: while the annotators exhibit minimal variance in determining the correctness of GPT-4's judgments, a discernible divergence emerged in the scoring of analytical responses.\\n\\nFigure 12.

Specifically, GPT-4V reached 78% in human agreement for Pair Comparison, with Gemini close at 72%, indicating strong performance in most sample pairs and supporting the idea that large models excel in pairwise distinctions (Zheng et al., 2023b), though improvements are needed in other judging settings.\\n\\nIn Scoring Evaluation, GPT-4V achieves a 70% human agreement rate, peaking at 79.9% in MS-COCO, while Gemini averaged 67.7%. To assess the consistency of MLLM judging quality across multiple responses to a single image-instruction pair, we use Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) metric to measure the average absolute variance between individual scores and the mean. Figure 18 shows that GPT-4V exhibits lower variation in quality assessments, indicating more consistent and reliable judgment compared to Gemini. However, in Batch Ranking, both models exhibited decreased alignment with human judgments, especially in Math and graphic information processing, suggesting that models may lack the capabilities to fully comprehend user instructions, leading to less reliable judgments.\\n\\n4.4. Multi-steps CoT Do Not Enhance Performance\\n\\nWe have conducted additional tests using GPT-4V and Gemini with a 3-step CoT approach for judging, as detailed in Table 5. Our analysis reveals that while employing CoT with additional steps markedly reduces hallucinations in judgments, it does not align more closely with human preferences. On numerous datasets, this approach even diminishes judging performance. Specifically, Gemini's effectiveness drops more drastically. With 3-step CoT, there is an increased likelihood that the judgment will be disturbed by its understanding of the figure and its own responses to the instruction, thereby undermining its final judgment if hallucinations exist in the previous chain.\\n\\n4.5. Vision Perception Benefits MLLM Judging\\n\\nWe explore the feasibility of using LLMs for judging text-based responses without directly analyzing the original images. This involves two approaches: omitting vision information entirely and providing a detailed description of the picture. We choose LLaMA-70b, Mixtral8x7b-v0.1 and GPT-3.5 to provide descriptions. Surprisingly, as illustrated in Table 6, we find that LLMs' performance in multimodal judging tasks significantly improve with picture descriptions, achieving a Pearson similarity of 0.435 in Scoring Evaluation tasks, markedly outperforming judgments made without any vision perception. Notably, in no-tie Pair Comparison, MLLMs with detailed vision descriptions even exceed the standard performance of MLLMs in judging. This suggests that MLLMs may lack certain human-like judging capabilities, while LLMs can be potential judges for multimodal tasks when provided with comprehensive task-related descriptions.\\n\\n4.6. Bias and Hallucination\\n\\nEgocentric Bias. Models tend to assign higher scores to their own responses while scoring others lower (Zheng et al., 2023b; Li et al., 2024). In Figures 19 and 20, GPT-4V exhibits a slight degree of Egocentricity. Conversely, Gemini maintains a uniform scoring distribution across different sources, demonstrating a more equitable approach to judgment. In contrast, GPT-4V shows self-preference, aligning its judgments with its predefined ethical guidelines. For example, GPT-4V consistently emphasizes privacy preservation, leading to higher scores for privacy-related questions based on its own metrics. Despite efforts in prompt engineering...\"}"}

How vision perception significantly enhances multimodal judging performance in traditional LLM-as-a-Judge setting, slightly outperforming MLLMs in judging. Vision Exp. stands for judging with a detailed image description.\\n\\nPosition Bias. Model consistently favor answers in specific positions, often influenced by training data that typically places correct responses at the beginning or end of prompts (Liu et al., 2023e). Figure 4 illustrates bias in LLaVA and CogVLM during Pair Comparison tasks, where they consistently prefer answers in a specific position. This bias likely arises from their limited ability to follow complex instructions, leading them to be influenced by prompt structure. For example, if a Batch Ranking prompt includes a sequence like 'ABCD', LLaVA replicates this sequence in 88.2% of responses, significantly more than other sequences. However, this bias can be reduced by introducing multiple examples, suggesting that prompts with more examples can better direct these models to follow instructions accurately.\\n\\nLength Bias. Models tend to prefer longer answers over concise but correct ones (Li et al., 2024), also known as verbosity bias (Zheng et al., 2023b). Figure 6 shows that both GPT-4V and Gemini assign higher scores to longer content. We conducted an expanded scoring experiment using GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023) without vision, increasing the semantic length of answers without changing their original intent. In Figure 7, we observe noticeable score increases, with GPT-4V and Gemini showing average gains of 0.6 and 0.75 points, respectively. These results suggest that MLLMs may favor longer text for higher scores.\\n\\nHallucination Detection and Mitigation. We observe a higher frequency of hallucinations in Batch Ranking, compared to Pair Comparison and Scoring Evaluation. These hallucinations involved significant misinterpretations and retrieval errors, impacting judgment accuracy and reliability. To address this, we employed a multi-step CoT approach...\"}"}

In Score evaluation, LLaVA-1.6-34b and Qwen-VL-Max slightly outperform others in Math, Chart, and Text tasks, showing a relatively strong scaling law.\\n\\n5. Related Work\\n\\nLLM as a Judge. The evolution of LLMs has made them increasingly effective evaluators in Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. Zhu et al. (2023) introduced JudgeLM for LLM evaluation, followed by AUTO-J (Li et al., 2023a), aligning closely with human judgment (Bai et al., 2023b; Li et al., 2023d; Kim et al., 2023). Advancements in CoT reasoning (Wei et al., 2022; Chu et al., 2023) and training-free instruction following (Brown et al., 2020; Wei et al., 2021) further extend LLMs' judging capability in diverse tasks like translation quality assessment (Kocmi & Federmann, 2023) and story generation (Chiang & Lee, 2023a).\\n\\nHallucination and Bias in Judgments. MLLMs suffer from vision and language hallucinations (Ji et al., 2023; Huang et al., 2023a; Cui et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023a), often due to vision-language misalignments in training phase (Sun et al., 2024; Huang et al., 2023b). Recent research focuses on hallucination evaluation (Liu et al., 2023a), detection (Li et al., 2023e; Wang et al., 2023a), and mitigation (Yin et al., 2023; Gunjal et al., 2023; Zhou et al., 2023), noting that even GPT-4V suffer from these issues (Shi et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023a; Cui et al., 2023).\\n\\n6. Future Directions\\n\\nMultimodal RLHF/DPO. Our work is highly connected with multimodal RLHF/DPO (Sun et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023c; Yu et al., 2023a). Our dataset includes extensive human annotations, such as manually assigned scores and preference on pairs, which could serve as invaluable training material for RLHF reward models and supply paired data essential for DPO (Rafailov et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2024), paving the way for enhancing the training of MLLMs.\\n\\nExploring the upper bound of MLLM-as-a-Judge. Beyond expanding the steps in the Chain of Thought prompting (Wei et al., 2022), we see significant potential in more sophisticated reasoning frameworks, such as multi-agent debating (Chan et al., 2023) when MLLM acts as a Judge, which could enhance the judging accuracy through improved reasoning capabilities. Additionally, addressing inherent biases in the model during the judgment process is crucial. For instance, position bias in Pair Comparison and Batch Ranking (Zheng et al., 2023a; Wang et al., 2024a), and the tendency to assign higher scores, as discussed in (Lee et al., 2024), are critical areas for improvement.\\n\\nIncorporating a human-in-the-loop approach (Wang et al., 2023b) offers a promising solution to enhance judgment consistency and reliability. For example, if judgment results vary in more than half of several repeated judgments, it may need human intervention for consistency checking. When it's challenging to discern the MLLM's judgment due to non-compliance with the suggested output format or lack of a clear outcome, human intervention may be required to refine this process by manually verifying judgments.\\n\\n7. Conclusion\\n\\nIn this paper, we have presented a new benchmark, termed MLLM-as-a-Judge, to assess the judging capabilities of MLLMs across three critical evaluation settings in the multimodal domain: Scoring Evaluation, Pair Comparison, and Batch Ranking. We further evaluate their agreement with humans. Our results reveal that advanced MLLMs can win significant human recognition in Pair Comparisons, but perform poorly in Scoring Evaluation and Batch Ranking tasks. Our work highlights potential areas for future refinement and improvement of MLLMs. We advocate for additional efforts dedicated to supporting the continuous development of MLLMs as judges.\"}"}

Comprehensive Related Works\\n\\nA.1. Large Model as Judge\\n\\nThe rapid development of LLMs has significantly enhanced their capabilities in long-term context perception and reasoning, increasingly popularizing their use as evaluators in various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. Zhu et al. (2023) were pioneers in this area, introducing JudgeLM, a fine-tuned LLM designed for evaluating other LLMs. Building on this, Li et al. (2023a) introduced AUTO-J, a system that evaluates LLMs through both pairwise comparisons and single-response assessments, demonstrating close alignment with human judgment (Bai et al., 2023b; Li et al., 2023d; Kim et al., 2023). Further advancements in LLMs, such as the development of Chain-of-Thought reasoning (Wei et al., 2022; Chu et al., 2023), training-free instruction following (Brown et al., 2020; Wei et al., 2021), and enhanced alignment with human preferences (Ouyang et al., 2022), have solidified their role in diverse tasks like translation quality assessment (Kocmi & Federmann, 2023) and story generation (Chiang & Lee, 2023a).\\n\\nA.2. Hallucination and Bias in Judge\\n\\nMLLMs are known to exhibit both vision hallucination and hallucination originating from LLMs, a phenomenon typically characterized by responses containing information not present in the visual or natural language context (Ji et al., 2023; Huang et al., 2023a; Cui et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023a). This issue often stems from misalignments in vision-language training (Sun et al., 2024; Huang et al., 2023b). Recent studies have begun to address these hallucination issues, focusing on evaluation (Liu et al., 2023a), detection (Li et al., 2023e; Wang et al., 2023a), and mitigation strategies (Yin et al., 2023; Gunjal et al., 2023; Zhou et al., 2023). Notably, GPT-4V (OpenAI, 2023), despite being a leading model in many fields (Yang et al., 2023; Wu et al., 2023b), has also demonstrated susceptibility to hallucinations (Shi et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023a; Cui et al., 2023). This raises concerns about the reliability of MLLMs in evaluative roles.\\n\\nIn terms of bias, MLLM judging is subject to issues not exclusive to our context of evaluation but also observed in human decision-making (Blunch, 1984; Raghubir & Valenzuela, 2006) and Machine Learning (ML) domains (Wang et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2023e; Huang et al., 2024a) such as position bias (Zheng et al., 2023a), egocentric bias (Li et al., 2024), and verbosity bias (Saito et al., 2023). The integration of visual perception in MLLMs introduces additional complexities, resulting in biases unique to the fusion of dual perceptions, an area that still demands thorough exploration.\\n\\nA.3. Evaluating Large Multimodal Models\\n\\nEvaluating MLLMs typically involves diverse tasks and corresponding metrics, which reflect the models' ability to comprehend and generate content based on both visual and textual information. For instance, in image captioning tasks, models are tasked with generating descriptive text for a given image. The effectiveness of these models is measured using metrics such as BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002), METEOR (Banerjee & Lavie, 2005), ROUGE (Lin, 2004), and CIDEr (Vedantam et al., 2015). In the context of Visual Question Answering (VQA), models are evaluated based on their ability to answer questions on an image's content. Here, the accuracy of model responses is compared against human-annotated answers, serving as the primary metric (Antol et al., 2015) to ensure alignment with human preferences.\\n\\nHowever, when tackling sophisticated visual-language tasks, conventional evaluation metrics often fail to accurately capture the nuanced responses generated by these models, especially in complex or subjective scenarios that involve both visual elements and extended textual content (Liu et al., 2023a). Additionally, while manual annotation offers a more comprehensive and human-like evaluation, it comes with significant challenges. These include high costs (Prendki, 2023), potential biases (Zheng et al., 2023b), and the difficulty of ensuring consistent replication (Chiang & Lee, 2023a). These limitations highlight the need for a more holistic approach to evaluation, one that combines human-like calibration with more fine-grained assessment methods.\\n\\nB. Detailed Benchmark Construction\\n\\nB.1. Step 1: Image-Instruction Collection\\n\\nTo attain the outlined objectives, our approach begins with a detailed analysis of the capabilities of MLLMs. Specifically, we focus on the following abilities within MLLMs:\\n\\n- **Recognition Ability**: This encompasses general visual recognition capabilities, such as object recognition, Optical...\"}"}

MLLM-as-a-Judge: A Benchmark to Assess Vision-Language Judging Ability\\n\\nFigure 2 shows an overview of our proposed MLLM-as-a-Judge, consisting of three steps: 1) image-instruction pair collection, 2) MLLM response collection, and 3) comparison with human annotation. Initially, we collect a dataset $P = \\\\{(M_1, I_1), \\\\ldots, (M_n, I_n)\\\\}$, containing pairs of images $(M)$ and their corresponding instructions $(I)$ sourced from 10 diverse domains (e.g., math, chart, diffusion), ensuring comprehensive coverage for a wide array of downstream tasks. Subsequently, each pair $(M_i, I_i)$ is processed through several MLLMs, generating a set of responses $R_i = \\\\{r_1, r_2, \\\\ldots, r_n\\\\}$ for each pair. This process contributes to the formation of the dataset of image-instruction-responses pairs, denoted as $D = \\\\{(M_i, I_i, R_i) | (M_i, I_i) \\\\in P\\\\}$. Finally, the dataset $D$ is partitioned into three distinct sub-sets to facilitate diverse task evaluations: $D_{score}$ for Scoring Evaluation, $D_{pair}$ for Pair Comparison, and $D_{batch}$ for Batch Ranking. Each subset will be employed for specific judging tasks, with each of them being configured as follows.\\n\\n- **Scoring Evaluation**: Each individual response is evaluated on a scale from 1 to 5, with the specific criteria for this rating system detailed in Appendix F.\\n- **Pair Comparison**: It involves a direct comparison between two responses, culminating in the identification of the superior one. Following the principles outlined by (Deutsch et al., 2023), a tie option is incorporated to ensure a more equitable assessment.\\n- **Batch Ranking**: The responses are systematically arranged in descending order of quality based on a given instruction, without any tie option.\\n\\n### 2.1. Step 1: Image-Instruction Pair Collection\\n\\nWe meticulously curate a dataset consisting of 4,414 image-text pairs, gathered from a variety of downstream task datasets, as detailed in Table 8 in Appendix B. These pairs are carefully tailored into image-instruction pairs to suit a free-form response format. To illustrate, within the domain of diffusion tasks, our dataset incorporated pairs challenging models to adeptly recognize and articulate connections between provided images and user-specified keywords.\\n\\n### 2.2. Step 2: MLLM Response Collection\\n\\nWe employ six widely-used MLLMs \u2013 GPT-4V (OpenAI, 2023), Gemini (GeminiTeam, 2023), LLaV A (Liu et al., 2023d), Qwen-VL-Max (Bai et al., 2023a), LLaV A-1.6-34b (Liu et al., 2023d), and CogVLM (Wang et al., 2023c) \u2013 to generate responses based on the image-instruction pairs, obtaining approximately 17,000 responses. Responses that are either too brief or non-compliant with security regulations (e.g., \u201cI'm sorry, but I cannot assist with this request\u201d) from GPT-4V and Gemini are excluded. The number of responses and the length distributions for different MLLMs are shown in Table 1 and Figure 3, respectively. We show specific hyper-parameter settings in Appendix B.2. Besides, we segment these responses into three non-overlapping groups, to prevent response overlap.\\n\\n### 2.3. Step 3: Comparison with Human Annotations\\n\\nThe annotation is conducted by 6 authors of this paper independently. These annotators are proficient in this domain, with different genders, ages, and educational backgrounds to...\"}"}

More details are referred to Appendix E.\\n\\n### 3. Experiment Settings\\n\\n#### 3.1. Settings of MLLM-as-a-Judge\\n\\nWe evaluate the judging performance of eleven leading MLLMs \u2013 GPT-4V (OpenAI, 2023), Gemini-Pro-Vision-1.0 (GeminiTeam, 2023), LLaV A-1.5-13b, LLaV A-1.6-7b/13b/34b (Liu et al., 2023d), Qwen-VL-Plus/Max (Bai et al., 2023a) and CogVLM (Wang et al., 2023c) \u2013 across three distinct evaluation settings. Adapting the \u201cAnalyze-then-Judge\u201d paradigm from Chiang & Lee (2023b), which is a one-step CoT approach (Wei et al., 2022), we first ask MLLMs to analyze responses and then provide a judgment based on their analysis. However, due to capability limitations to perform the \u201cAnalyze-then-Judge\u201d setting for LLaV A and CogVLM, we prompt them to directly output their judgment.\\n\\nWe also evaluate whether multi-step CoT will enhance the performance of MLLM serving as a judge. Furthermore, to extensively explore MLLMs judging capabilities, we conduct experiments on various settings, including scenarios without vision input, replacing vision input with a detailed description generated by GPT-4V as a vision expert, and employing multi-step CoT. Considering that the first two settings do not involve image inputs, we also include tests on the latest GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023) Gemini (GeminiTeam, 2023), LLaMA-2-70b (Touvron et al., 2023), and Mixtral-8x7b (Jiang et al., 2024) to assess whether LLMs can effectively perform judging tasks without vision perception. Comprehensive details of these experimental setups are available in Appendix C, and the prompts can be found in Appendix F.\\n\\n### 3.2. Judging Metrics\\n\\nAfter collecting responses from MLLM judgments, we quantify their alignment with human annotations across three settings, employing distinct metrics as follows:\\n\\n- **Scoring Evaluation:** Following LLM-as-a-Judge (Zheng et al., 2023b), we compute the Pearson similarity (Lee Rodgers & Nicewander, 1988) between the MLLMs\u2019 judgments and human ratings across different sub-datasets.\\n\\n- **Pair Comparison:** We assess the similarity between the MLLM judgments and human decisions using accuracy, F1-score (Goutte & Gaussier, 2005), and recall (Goutte & Gaussier, 2005) to assess the judging abilities of models.\\n\\n- **Batch Evaluation:** We consolidate the ranking results into a singular sequence and employ the Normalized Levenshtein distance (Levenshtein et al., 1966) to evaluate the similarity between judgments from MLLMs and human annotation.\\n\\n### 3.3. Human Agreement in MLLM Judgment\\n\\nApart from traditional metrics for similarity assessment between judgments from MLLMs and humans, we further evaluate the judgments provided by MLLMs to uncover latent bias and hallucination in 10 datasets. We also invite human annotators for further validation, focusing on the following aspects:\"}"}

While some judgments might appear reasonable, they may still be considered incorrect due to unique human perspectives. Hence, we conduct experiments on human agreement to address situations that traditional metrics may not adequately capture.\\n\\nAnalysis Grading: Each MLLM analysis is assigned a score from 1 to 5, considering relevance, accuracy, creativity, and response granularity, detailed in Appendix F.\\n\\nHallucination Detection: Given the propensity for hallucination issues in the complex reasoning chains and long-term vision-language contexts of MLLMs, we task human annotators with identifying any hallucinations in the analyses of MLLM judgments, adhering to established definitions of vision and language hallucination (Sun et al., 2024).\"}"}

MLLM Judging Consistency\\nTo be a reliable judge, consistent decision-making across repeated evaluations of the same query is crucial. For this purpose, we conduct six repeated tests with MLLM judgments and calculated the weighted average consistency scores and Majority Consistency Criterion ratios for GPT-4V and Gemini, as shown in Table 4 and Figure 5. Despite a higher temperature setting, GPT-4V substantially outperforms Gemini across all tasks. Particularly in Pair Comparison, GPT-4V achieves a higher consistency score of 0.675, but it encounters difficulties in maintaining similar levels of consistency in Scoring and Batch Ranking tasks, with scores dropping to 0.611 and 0.418, indicating the challenge of producing qualified and convincing judgments.\\n\\n4.3. Human Agreement\\nOur manual evaluation of MLLMs on agreement and scoring revealed notable findings. Table 3 shows that GPT-4V performs slightly better than Gemini in terms of agreement, with Gemini failing in diffusion tasks and its results being omitted. GPT-4V achieves a higher average score of 0.796 compared to Gemini\u2019s 0.783, indicating a significant lead with a mean Levenshtein Distance of 0.361. However, there is still substantial room for improvement in this task for all MLLMs.\"}"}
