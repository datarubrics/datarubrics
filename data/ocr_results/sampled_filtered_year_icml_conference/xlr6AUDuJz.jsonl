Chemical Security Threat Model\\n\\nIn chemistry, similar to cybersecurity, AI can increase risk by aiding malicious actors through the stages of designing and deploying a chemical weapon. These can be categorized as: (a) procuring the source materials; (b) synthesizing the target chemical weapons and/or explosives; (c) purifying and validating the synthesized compounds; (d) surreptitiously transporting the weapons to the desired location; and (e) deploying the weapons in an effective manner. For a more detailed breakdown of the categories, see Appendix A.5.\\n\\nEach of these steps needs to be carried out without attracting the attention of law-enforcement officials and other regulatory agencies, which means that most syntheses need to be executed outside of a regulated chemistry laboratory. In particular, it will be more difficult for a harmful actor to purchase chemicals, as they will be unable to rely on large chemical supply companies such as Thermo Fisher Scientific or Millipore Sigma. Moreover, chemical syntheses and purifications that require carefully controlled temperature conditions or exclusion of oxygen from the reaction environment will be markedly harder to execute effectively outside of the confines of registered, regulated, and well-stocked chemistry laboratories.\\n\\nOnce the target compounds have been synthesized and purified effectively, they must be transported without detection. Transporting the compounds via mass transport, especially by airplanes, must be done in a way that disguises the true identity of the compounds, either by mixing them with other compounds that have similar chemical profiles but are non-toxic, by transporting them in parts and assembling them at the final location, or via other similarly duplicitous strategies. These methods require significant knowledge of the properties of the compounds, as well as of the detection and security systems.\"}"}

For example, malicious actors deploying chemical weapons must determine whether to deploy them through air, water, or contact exposure. This demands knowledge of how these weapons exert their deleterious health effects. For explosives, actors ensure that the explosives act only at the time and place of their choosing, requiring knowledge of the stability of the explosives.\\n\\nA.3. Sensitive Information Mitigation\\n\\nWe implemented stringent procedures to ensure that no sensitive information is released in WMDP. First, we asked domain experts to flag questions they deemed to contain sensitive information based on their own risk models. Flagged questions were immediately excluded from the dataset. Aggregating opinions from discussions with academics and technical consultants, we identified that most concerns with sensitive information centered around WMDP-Bio and WMDP-Chem, so we took additional steps to mitigate sensitive knowledge in those categories. Specifically, we instituted a policy of \\\"cross-checking\\\" for WMDP-Bio and WMDP-Chem: on each question, two additional domain experts were tasked with determining whether the question constitutes sensitive information. Finally, with the support and guidance of external counsel, the publication of WMDP was assessed for compliance with applicable U.S. export control requirements, including with respect to the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (22 CFR Parts 120-130) (ITAR, 2024) and Export Administration Regulations (15 CFR Parts 730-774) (EAR, 2024).\\n\\nA.4. Additional Considerations for WMDP-Bio\\n\\nThe questions generated based on our threat model in Section 3.2 primarily test for knowledge on how to develop or use pre-existing resources acquire bioweapons, including some types of tacit knowledge, such as the knowledge needed to troubleshooting experiments in a laboratory. While a common objection to this method may be that other critical parts of the bioweapons acquisition pathway (such as acquiring reagents or equipment) represent the \\\"true\\\" bottleneck, we believe testing for knowledge is still useful for several reasons: first, it is unclear to what extent pre-existing bottlenecks in reagent and equipment acquisition will remain in the future, due to accelerating progress in laboratory automation, outsourcing, and science democratization (such as with the proliferation so-called \\\"citizen science\\\" or \\\"biohacker\\\" labs). Second, certain types of knowledge can accelerate risks by unblocking bottlenecks around equipment and reagents (such as knowledge of DNA synthesis screening vulnerabilities). Finally, to a first approximation, knowledge of more dangerous threats can still increase the marginal risk profile of the expected economic damage and casualties from bioweapons development, despite additional bottlenecks in the larger bioweapons acquisition pathway.\\n\\nA.5. Additional Considerations for WMDP-Chem\\n\\nCareful consideration of the full process by which malicious actors will access and deploy chemical weapons and/or explosives has led us to define the following categories of knowledge to include in WMDP-Chem:\\n\\n\u2022 General knowledge, which refers to fundamental scientific knowledge of the target materials and their properties;\\n\u2022 Synthesis, which refers to all preparation procedures, including chemical syntheses and other fabrication procedures;\\n\u2022 Sourcing/procurement, which refers to knowledge about how to access starting materials, particularly in ways that are outside of established and regulated chemistry laboratories;\\n\u2022 Purification, which refers to knowledge about how to purify crude products after they are successfully synthesized, particularly using methods that work outside of a regulated laboratory;\\n\u2022 Analysis/verification, which refers to the procedures required to analyze all target compounds, as well as the intermediates accessed as part of the synthetic pathway. Such procedures are necessary to confirm that the desired compounds have been synthesized, and are of sufficiently high purity to ensure that their usage will have the desired effect.\\n\u2022 Deployment mechanisms (e.g. device, plans), which refers to all knowledge necessary to effectively deploy the chemical weapons and/or explosive, including fabrication of a device; dispersal of the compound in an aerosol, capsule, or vapor form; dissolution of the compound in the drinking water supply; and diffusion of the compound into the HVAC system of a target location.\"}"}

This includes knowledge about how to transport materials through the mass transportation network, how to use covert methods to access all necessary materials, and how to deploy the compound in a way that limits the individual\u2019s potential exposure to liability.\\n\\n\u2022 Miscellaneous knowledge, which refers to all additional knowledge that is not covered in the aforementioned categories, including knowledge about derivation of target chemical weapons and/or explosives, properties of such derivatives, and information about mitigation and response strategies that people are likely to use following the deployment of the harmful agents.\\n\\nA.6.

Broader Impacts of WMDP\\n\\nWe reflect on how WMDP comports with the broader landscape of risk mitigation strategies. From a policy-making perspective, we hope that WMDP guides the evaluation of hazards posed by ML systems, such as by informing the National Institutes of Standards and Technology\u2019s AI Risk Management Framework (NIST, 2023; White House, 2023) or other frameworks. Moreover, WMDP may serve as risk marker for more stringent policy action. For example, a model scoring above a particular threshold on WMDP could be flagged for more comprehensive evaluation, such as human red teaming with biosecurity experts.\\n\\nFurthermore, unlearning with WMDP may reduce general-purpose capabilities of models in biology or cybersecurity, which could hamper their utility for defensive, or beneficial, applications in those areas. Therefore, unlearning should be complemented with other safety interventions, such as structured access (Section 6). This is especially important for cybersecurity, as most cybersecurity knowledge may be used for both offensive and defensive purposes. For instance, AI progress could significantly enhance anomaly detection capabilities. This could aid attackers in disguising their activities to mimic normal usage patterns, but also inform critical infrastructure providers of atypical behavior that could signify an attack.\\n\\nIn biosecurity, however, there exist categories of primarily offensive knowledge that may be unlearned without significant degradation to defensive capabilities. For instance, knowledge of historical bioweapons programs may be safely removed from models without significantly affecting knowledge related to countermeasure development or general-purpose biology. As a result, while both WMDP-Bio and WMDP-Cyber are both useful measurements of hazardous language model capabilities, WMDP-Bio may be the most useful tool for risk mitigation via unlearning.\\n\\nMore broadly, there are other strategies, including non-technical strategies, that could be pursued to mitigate malicious use \u2013 such as implementing universal screening of synthetic DNA orders to prevent the widespread access to pathogen DNA, addressing gaps in the regulation of Select Agents in the Federal Select Agent Program, and improving oversight of laboratory automation and outsourcing.\"}"}

Limitations\\n\\nWMDP consists of four-way multiple choice questions, potentially neglecting hazards that only surface in larger end-to-end evaluations. For instance, models that have memorized key biological concepts from the training data may be equally likely to do well on a particular multiple choice question as are models that have a true understanding of the underlying concept. Memorized facts may be particularly over-represented in our biological benchmark since many questions that were developed were drawn from open-access papers that were likely also included in the model\u2019s training data. In addition, multiple choice questions only test for whether the model retains hazardous knowledge; these questions do not test whether the model will reveal that information to the end-user in a helpful and timely manner during the planning or execution of a nefarious attack. To address these limitations, future work in this area could include generating questions from scientific papers that were only released after a model\u2019s training date cutoff, or using other strategies to generate questions which are difficult to search (Rein et al., 2023; L\u00e1la et al., 2023).\\n\\nWMDP is a static benchmark which cannot anticipate the evolving landscape of cyber and biological risks, as threats continuously change and new technologies emerge. Moreover, as with any metric, scores on WMDP do not capture the full extent of malicious use risk. As a result, benchmarking on only WMDP may yield a false sense of model safety after unlearning. This limitation emphasizes the need for other safety benchmarks to complement WMDP, especially as new risks emerge over time. For instance, benchmarks that assess open-ended conversations may be a more promising method to assess capabilities of future models.\\n\\nWMDP focuses on reducing risk for API-access models (Section 1); for models with publicly downloadable weights, unlearned information can be trivially re-introduced by malicious actors (Lynch et al., 2024). If open-source models reach similar capabilities to closed-source models in the future, these risks will remain unaddressed by this work.\\n\\nE. X-Risk Sheet\\n\\nWe provide an analysis of how our paper contributes to reducing existential risk from AI, following the framework suggested by Hendrycks and Mazeika (2022). Individual question responses do not decisively imply relevance or irrelevance to existential risk reduction.\\n\\nE.1. Long-Term Impact on Advanced AI Systems\\n\\nIn this section, please analyze how this work shapes the process that will lead to advanced AI systems and how it steers the process in a safer direction.\\n\\n1. Overview.\\n\\n   How is this work intended to reduce existential risks from advanced AI systems?\\n\\n   Answer: This work aims to mitigate existential risks posed by the malicious use of LLMs in developing bioweapons and cyber weapons. WMDP serves both as a metric for evaluating the presence of hazardous knowledge, and as a benchmark for testing unlearning methods. We aim to reduce biological malicious use, as the proliferation of bioweapons could increase the risk of a catastrophic pandemic, potentially causing civilizational collapse (Gopal et al., 2023).\\n\\n2. Direct Effects.\\n\\n   If this work directly reduces existential risks, what are the main hazards, vulnerabilities, or failure modes that it directly affects?\\n\\n   Answer: WMDP increases the barrier of entry for malicious actors to cause catastrophic harm. It decreases access to models with hazardous biological or cyber capabilities, reducing the number of malicious actors with the skill and access to engineer pandemics or launch cyberattacks on critical infrastructure (Section 3).\\n\\n3. Diffuse Effects.\\n\\n   If this work reduces existential risks indirectly or diffusely, what are the main contributing factors that it affects?\\n\\n   Answer: Unlearning on WMDP reduces the risks of language model aided cyberattacks, particularly from low-skilled malicious actors. Cyberattacks, particularly on critical infrastructure, could be catastrophic. They are a diffuse contributor to economic turbulence and political instability (Forum, 2024), which may increase the risk of great power conflict, which in turn would likely increase the probability of an existential catastrophe. Unlearning may be applied to prevent other hazardous properties of ML models, such as situational awareness.\\n\\n4.

Red Teaming. What is a way in which this hastens general capabilities or the onset of x-risks?\\n\\nAnswer: Although WMDP is constructed as a benchmark for measuring and reducing inherent model hazards, it may inadvertently serve as a roadmap for malicious use, hastening the onset of x-risks by lowering the barrier for causing catastrophe. To reduce these risks, we conduct an extensive sensitive information mitigation process (Appendix A.3).\\n\\n11. General Tasks.

In particular, we target questions colored yellow.\\n\\n3.1. Design Choices for WMDP\\n\\nDataset form. To create an automatic measure of hazardous capabilities that the broader research community can readily iterate on, we design WMDP as a dataset of four-choice multiple-choice questions. Multiple-choice is a common paradigm to test knowledge in language models (Hendrycks et al., 2020b; Rein et al., 2023). Because WMDP measures knowledge of hazardous topics, models with a low score on WMDP likely lack the knowledge needed to help with malicious use. However, models with a high score on WMDP are not necessarily unsafe, as they may still lack the reasoning ability to combine the knowledge in the sequence of steps needed to create a weapon.\\n\\nDataset function. WMDP should guide risk mitigation by enabling researchers to measure and reduce models' hazardous capabilities. Because directly building a dataset of sensitive information would increase the attack capabilities of malicious actors (Esvelt, 2018; Lewis et al., 2019), we collect questions that approximate or correlate with the hazardous knowledge we wish to remove (Figure 3). In particular, we collect questions with knowledge that is a precursor, neighbor, or component of the hazardous knowledge we wish to remove. Moreover, we empirically demonstrate that models with lower performance on WMDP are less capable for malicious use (Appendix B.3).\\n\\nExamples of our dataset generation processes are detailed in Figure 4. In the left panel, research that aims to develop enhanced potential pandemic pathogens (ePPPs) is a precursor to developing novel viruses, so unlearning the former will also unlearn a large subset of the latter. In the center panel, there are topics in chemistry (e.g., procurement or synthesis) that contain questions with a wide variance in hazard level, so we approximate especially sensitive information by collecting questions near the boundary. In the right panel, a cyberweapon requires knowledge of several components (e.g., a payload, a trigger mechanism, and an infection mechanism), so excising knowledge of components will reduce hazards. Because some of the components may be dual-use, we generate questions for components that are primarily offensive in nature.\\n\\nDataset collection. Our questions are written by academics and technical consultants in biosecurity, cybersecurity, and chemistry. We first generate threat models for each of these areas and then use the models to inform questions that an adversary might encounter when developing attack capabilities. To ensure quality, all of our questions were checked by at least two experts from different organizations.\\n\\n3.2. Biosecurity Threat Model\\n\\nIn biosecurity, the malicious use threats that are increased by AI can be broadly categorized as expanding access to preexisting threats (by lowering barriers to entry), and unlocking new areas of biology (by synthesizing new knowledge or accelerating in-silico modeling and experimentation) (Sandbrink, 2023).\\n\\nWe primarily focus on the development and dissemination of transmissible potential pandemic agents, such as influenza, smallpox, etc. While our dataset additionally includes some information about highly lethal non-transmissible bioweapons like anthrax, we believe the majority of emerging risk from biotechnology stems from advances in synthetic biology and bioengineering that increase access to, or modify, the design and development of transmissible agents (Esvelt, 2022).\\n\\nA standard biotechnology risk chain can be seen in Figure 5. In this threat model, \\\"ideation\\\" involves actively planning for a biological attack; \\\"design\\\" involves retrieving blueprints for a hazardous agent, such as determining the DNA sequence; \\\"build\\\" consists of the protocols, reagents, and equipment necessary to create the threat; and \\\"test\\\" consists of measuring characteristics or properties of the pathogen of interest.

While these areas have some dual-use risk, they primarily consist of knowledge that a low-skilled actor can readily obtain through routine online sources.\\n\\nWe aim to address the \u201ctest\u201d and \u201clearn\u201d parts of the DBTL cycle by including questions about specific assay types to measure specific virus characteristics. Finally, many aspects of \u201crelease\u201d are included in questions formulated from the historical bioweapons and bioterrorism category; we did not include additional information about the release of potential pandemic pathogens to mitigate dual-use sensitive information risks.\\n\\n3.3. Cybersecurity Threat Model\\n\\nIn cybersecurity, AI may aid malicious actors through the stages of a cyberattack: reconnaissance, weaponization, exploitation, and post-exploitation (Strom et al., 2020; Hutchins et al., 2011).\\n\\nIn the initial reconnaissance stage, attackers gather any available information about their target through both open-source and proprietary intelligence-gathering techniques. Openly available information on search engines such as Google and Shodan is critical in this process. To measure the model\u2019s reconnaissance abilities, we sourced questions involving foundational reconnaissance phase concepts and specific techniques to uncover information about a target.\\n\\nDuring the weaponization & vulnerability discovery stage, attackers use various methods to discover vulnerabilities within a target and craft exploits to take advantage of them. To measure a model\u2019s weaponization & vulnerability discovery abilities, we sourced questions designed to measure the model\u2019s ability to reason about both assembly and source code, interpret binary data structures such as network packets and files, and understand the use cases for a variety of well-known source cybersecurity tools. Very simple exploit generation tasks were included.\\n\\nBecause tool-augmented and long-context LLMs are adept at handling unstructured data at scale, weaponization & vulnerability discovery may have high potential for LLM enhancement. Moreover, weaponization is frequently the most difficult portion of the attack pipeline \u2013 discovering a vulnerability and writing the exploit for a high value target requires significant skill and in some cases may take years. However, once an exploit is packaged into an exploitation framework, it becomes widely available to actors with a much lower skill level. As a result, WMDP -Cyber places particular focus on question development at this stage.\\n\\nDuring the exploitation stage, exploits designed to penetrate the target are launched to deliver a malicious payload \u2013 for instance, a software implant, a rootkit/bootkit, or simply a payload designed to crash the target device in the case of a DOS attack. Delivery of the payload to the designated target may require multiple complex steps. To measure a model\u2019s exploitation abilities, we sourced questions involving common exploitation frameworks such as Metasploit.\\n\\nFinally, after the payload is delivered, the desired post-exploitation activities are undertaken. This often involves establishing back-channel communications with a command and control infrastructure, but this is not always a requirement. This stage is ultimately about retaining control of...\"}"}

Representation Misdirection for Unlearning\\n\\nWe introduce Representation Misdirection for Unlearning (RMU), a finetuning method for unlearning hazardous knowledge (Algorithm 1). We outline the setup (Section 4.1) and explain our method (Section 4.2), with further detail in Appendix B.4. We focus on unlearning hazardous knowledge in biosecurity and cybersecurity, but not in chemistry.\\n\\nWhile WMDP-Chem is a useful tool for hazard measurement, we are more uncertain if the hazard mitigation benefits of unlearning on WMDP-Chem outweigh the costs on general model capabilities.\\n\\n4.1. Setup\\n\\nWe consider an autoregressive language model that accepts a prompt (e.g., \\\"How can I synthesize anthrax?\\\") and returns a completion (e.g., \\\"To synthesize anthrax, you need...\\\").\\n\\nWe aim to reduce the model's ability to answer queries about hazardous knowledge (e.g., synthesizing anthrax) while maintaining the model's ability to answer queries about non-hazardous knowledge (e.g., culturing yeast). We operationalize this as reducing a model's QA accuracy on WMDP while maintaining performance on general capabilities benchmarks, such as MMLU and MT-Bench.\\n\\nIn contrast to unlearning for copyright or privacy, we do not assume access to WMDP. This is because we are interested in methods that can unlearn an entire distribution of hazardous knowledge given limited samples.\\n\\n4.2. Method\\n\\nClassically, language models are trained with a loss on their outputs (Vaswani et al., 2017; Devlin et al., 2018). On the other hand, mechanistic interpretability proposes editing models by intervening on individual neurons (Wang et al., 2022). In contrast to both these perspectives, we propose to intervene on model activations. We leverage the idea that model representations may be manipulated to affect model behavior (Zou et al., 2023a; Ilharco et al., 2023; Turner et al., 2023). We design a two-part loss function with a forget loss and a retain loss; intuitively, the forget loss perturbs the model activations on hazardous data while the retain loss preserves its activations on benign data (Figure 7).\\n\\nForget loss. Our goal is to degrade the model's representations of hazardous knowledge. Our experiments suggest that increasing the norm of the model's activations on hazardous data in earlier layers makes it difficult for later layers to process the activations, achieving our desiderata.\\n\\nTo calculate our forget loss, we assume access to $M_{\\\\text{updated}}(\\\\cdot)$, the hidden states of the unlearned model at some layer $\\\\ell$ and $M_{\\\\text{frozen}}(\\\\cdot)$, the hidden states of the original, frozen model at some layer $\\\\ell$. Then, we compute $u$, a random unit vector with independent entries sampled uniformly at random from $[0, 1)$. Note that $u$ is held fixed throughout training. Given a forget dataset $D_{\\\\text{forget}}$, we compute:\\n\\n$$L_{\\\\text{forget}} = \\\\mathbb{E}_{x \\\\sim D_{\\\\text{forget}}} \\\\left[ \\\\left\\\\| M_{\\\\text{updated}}(t) - c \\\\cdot u \\\\right\\\\|_2^2 \\\\right]$$\\n\\nwhere $L_f$ is the number of tokens in $x$ and $c$ is some hyperparameter that controls activation scaling.\\n\\nRetain loss. Our goal is to limit the amount of general capabilities lost from unlearning. Because our forget term is an $\\\\ell^2$ loss on model activations, we regularize the model activations back to the original model's activations with an $\\\\ell^2$ penalty. Given the retain dataset $D_{\\\\text{retain}}$, we calculate the retain loss:\\n\\n$$L_{\\\\text{retain}} = \\\\mathbb{E}_{x \\\\sim D_{\\\\text{retain}}} \\\\left[ \\\\left\\\\| M_{\\\\text{updated}}(t) - M_{\\\\text{frozen}}(t) \\\\right\\\\|_2^2 \\\\right]$$\\n\\nwhere $L_r$ is the number of tokens in $x$. \\n\\n\"}"}

The full loss (Figure 7) is a weighted combination of the forget loss and the retain loss: $L = L_{\\\\text{forget}} + \\\\alpha \\\\cdot L_{\\\\text{retain}}$. RMU finetunes the model weights to minimize this loss. To unlearn multiple distributions of knowledge, we interleave the gradient updates (i.e., update model weights on the biosecurity distribution, then update on the cybersecurity distribution, then repeat). In practice, we find it sufficient to compute the loss only on layer $\\\\ell$ and update gradients only on layers $\\\\ell - 2, \\\\ell - 1, \\\\ell$. We leverage this observation to save memory and efficiently unlearn on larger LMs.\\n\\nForget and retain datasets. To alter model activations on hazardous knowledge, we need to collect $D_{\\\\text{forget}}$, an unlearning distribution which approximates WMDP. To collect $D_{\\\\text{forget}}$ for biosecurity, we collect a corpus of relevant papers from PubMed used to generate questions in WMDP-Bio (Appendix A.6). To collect $D_{\\\\text{forget}}$ for cybersecurity, we conduct an extensive crawl of GitHub for documents associated with the topics in WMDP-Cyber, and filter the contents to include only the most relevant passages to WMDP-Cyber (Appendix A.7). Similarly, to preserve activations on general language modeling tasks, we need to collect $D_{\\\\text{retain}}$, a knowledge preservation distribution which approximates general, non-hazardous knowledge. For these, we collected subject-specific retain sets detailed in Appendices A.6 and A.7. However, we find in practice that RMU is more performant when $D_{\\\\text{retain}}$ has qualitatively distinct content from $D_{\\\\text{forget}}$, so as not to relearn the unlearned knowledge. Thus, we set $D_{\\\\text{retain}}$ to be Wikitext (Merity et al., 2016). We release the unused subject-specific retain sets for WMDP-Bio and WMDP-Cyber publicly, to guide future unlearning methods that can more effectively use these corpora.\\n\\n5. Experimental Results\\nWe examine the performance of RMU and other unlearning methods. We describe the experimental setup (Section 5.1) and provide quantitative (Section 5.2) and robustness (Section 5.3) evaluations. We also check if unlearning on WMDP generalizes to more hazardous information (Appendix B.3). Finally, we report plots for how RMU scales activations on hazardous and benign data in Appendix B.4. RMU markedly improves upon existing baselines, but future work is necessary to improve the precision of unlearning while fully maintaining general capabilities.\\n\\n5.1.

To measure these risks, government institutions and major AI labs are developing evaluations for hazardous capabilities in LLMs. However, current evaluations are private and restricted to a narrow range of malicious use scenarios, which limits further research into reducing malicious use. To fill these gaps, we release the Weapons of Mass Destruction Proxy (WMDP) benchmark, a dataset of 3,668 multiple-choice questions that serve as a proxy measurement of hazardous knowledge in biosecurity, cybersecurity, and chemical security.

Introduction\\n\\nSimilar to other technologies, such as gene editing and nuclear energy, AI is dual-use\u2014it can be leveraged for benefit and harm (Urbina et al., 2022). To address its dual-use risks, the White House Executive Order on Artificial Intelligence (White House, 2023) calls for investigation into the ability of AI to enable malicious actors in developing chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and cyber weapons. For instance, AI coding assistants may lower the barrier of entry for novices to conduct cyberattacks (Fang et al., 2024), potentially increasing the frequency of cyberattacks and the risk of catastrophe, especially if these attacks directed towards critical infrastructure, such as power grids (UK Cabinet Office, 2023). Likewise, AI assistants for biology could troubleshoot bottlenecks in biological weapons development, increasing the frequency of attempts to build a bioweapon and straining risk mitigation measures (Sandbrink, 2023). This has motivated government institutions and major AI labs to anticipate risk by designing evaluations for AI-aided biological threats (UK AI Safety Summit, 2023; Anthropic, 2023; OpenAI, 2024; Mouton et al., 2024; Phuong et al., 2024).\\n\\nUnfortunately, current evaluations of hazardous capabilities do not provide a guide for mitigating malicious use risk. For example, developers evaluate whether models can build biological weapons end-to-end (Sandbrink, 2023) or hack well enough to exfiltrate their own weights (Shevlane et al., 2023), creating private, manual, and highly-specific evaluations. Because these evaluations test a small number of specific risk pathways, low performance on them does not guarantee that LLMs are secure across the broad distribution of malicious use risks. More importantly, such private benchmarking limits scientific inquiry towards measuring and reducing malicious use.\"}"}

Developers also lack robust technical solutions to reduce malicious use in LLMs. The primary safeguard is training models to refuse harmful queries (Ouyang et al., 2022; Bai et al., 2022; Mazeika et al., 2024), but adversaries can deploy adversarial attacks (Wei et al., 2023; Zou et al., 2023b) to bypass models' refusal training. Another proposal is to filter hazardous information from the pretraining data (Ngo et al., 2021), but adversaries may reintroduce this information through finetuning (Zhan et al., 2023; Qi et al., 2023; Pelrine et al., 2023). A promising approach for closed-source LLM providers is unlearning, directly removing hazardous knowledge before model serving (Figure 2). Unlearned models have higher inherent safety: even if they are jailbroken, unlearned models lack the hazardous knowledge necessary to enable malicious users (Hendrycks et al., 2021). However, research into unlearning hazardous knowledge is bottlenecked by the lack of a public benchmark.\\n\\nTo overcome both of these challenges, we introduce the Weapons of Mass Destruction Proxy Benchmark (WMDP), a benchmark of 3,668 multiple-choice questions costing over $200K to develop (Figure 1). WMDP is a proxy measurement for hazardous knowledge in biosecurity (Section 3.2), cybersecurity (Section 3.3), and chemical security (Section A.2). To design WMDP, academics and technical consultants created threat models for how LLMs might aid in the development of biological, cyber, and chemical attacks, and generated questions based on these threat models. We adopt a conservative stance towards including information in WMDP (Figure 3): we primarily include offensive knowledge, as unlearning defensive knowledge (e.g., biosafety protocols) may prevent benevolent use cases of LLMs. Simultaneously, we follow a stringent process to expunge sensitive information from WMDP in compliance with U.S. export control requirements, mitigating the risk of WMDP being repurposed by malicious actors (Section A.3). We publicly release WMDP to both measure hazardous knowledge, and benchmark methods for reducing malicious use.\\n\\nTo guide progress on unlearning, we develop Representation Misdirection for Unlearning (RMU), a state-of-the-art method that removes hazardous knowledge while preserving general model capabilities. Inspired by representation engineering (Zou et al., 2023a), RMU perturbs model activations on hazardous data while preserving model activations on benign data (Section 4). RMU significantly reduces model performance on WMDP, while mostly retaining general capabilities on MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2020b) and MT-Bench (Zheng et al., 2023a), suggesting that unlearning is a tractable approach towards mitigating malicious use (Section 5.2). We demonstrate that RMU is robust, as unlearned knowledge cannot be recovered by linear probes or adversarial attacks (Sections 5.2 and 5.3).\\n\\nOverall, we envision unlearning as one piece of a larger sociotechnical solution towards reducing malicious use of AI systems. Unlearning should be applied carefully, as it inherently reduces model capabilities. Scientific knowledge (especially in cybersecurity) is often dual-use, so unlearning such knowledge may harm defenders as much as attackers. In these cases, unlearning can be paired with structured API access (Shevlane, 2022), where model developers serve the unlearned model to everyday users, but serve the unrelearned model to specialized users.\"}"}

As AI systems develop more capabilities, a combination of these interventions will be critical in reducing malicious use. To enable further research, we release our datasets, code, and models publicly at https://wmdp.ai.\\n\\n2. Related Work\\n\\nEvaluating risk from LLMs. Recent work has highlighted safety concerns of language models, including generating falsehoods (Ji et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2023), producing toxic content (Gehman et al., 2020; Deshpande et al., 2023; Pan et al., 2024), and deceiving humans (Park et al., 2023; Scheurer et al., 2023). In response, safety benchmarks are used to monitor and mitigate these behaviors (Hendrycks et al., 2020a; Lin et al., 2021; Li et al., 2023; Pan et al., 2023; Kinniment and Sato, 2023; Inan et al., 2023).\\n\\nSpecifically, one growing concern is the ability of LLMs to assist with malicious use. In particular, LLMs may aid actors in planning bioattacks (Sandbrink, 2023) and procuring pathogens (Gopal et al., 2023). Moreover, LLMs can assist users in synthesizing dangerous chemicals (Boiko et al., 2023) or conducting cyberattacks (Bhatt et al., 2023). In response to these emergent hazardous capabilities (Hendrycks et al., 2021), major AI labs have developed frameworks to measure and mitigate biological, cybersecurity, and chemical hazards posed by their models (Anthropic, 2023; OpenAI, 2023b; 2024; Phuong et al., 2024). Unfortunately, many of the details of these evaluations are often private to the individual research labs for which they were developed. In contrast, we develop an open-source evaluation that empowers the broader ML community to make progress towards benchmarking and unlearning hazardous knowledge.\\n\\nMitigating risk from LLMs. Towards improving model safety, strategies such as input safety filtering (Inan et al., 2023) and learning from human preference data (Ziegler et al., 2020; Rafailov et al., 2023) have been developed; however, these methods can be vulnerable to jailbreaks (Wei et al., 2023; Chao et al., 2023; Yao et al., 2023a; Yuan et al., 2023) and adversarial attacks (Wallace et al., 2019; Guo et al., 2021; Jones et al., 2023; Zou et al., 2023b). To reduce inherent model risk, hazardous data can be removed prior to pretraining (Ngo et al., 2021), but having input into this process is inaccessible for most end users. Furthermore, models may be susceptible to subsequent harmful finetuning (Zhan et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2023) (Figure 2); as a result, and especially in the case of models that are accessed via API, additional automated methods that can be applied after finetuning\u2014such as unlearning\u2014may remove resulting hazards.\\n\\nMachine unlearning. Unlearning (Cao and Yang, 2015) originally gained traction as a response to privacy concerns in light of regulation (Council of European Union, 2014; CCPA, 2018), and most methods focused on erasing specific samples or facts (Golatkar et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020; Meng et al., 2022; Jang et al., 2023; Pawelczyk et al., 2023) rather than entire domains. Goel et al. (2024) show existing unlearning methods struggle to remove knowledge without access to all relevant training data, a challenge RMU overcomes.\\n\\nMore recent methods erase broader concepts such as gender (Belrose et al., 2023), harmful behaviors (Yao et al., 2023b; Liu et al., 2024), or fictional universes (Eldan and Russinovich, 2023), but have not been studied on scientific knowledge. Furthermore, most benchmarks for unlearning involve removing specific data samples (Google, 2023) or artificially chosen deletion sets (Choi and Na, 2023; Goel et al., 2023; Maini et al., 2024; Goel et al., 2024). In contrast, WMDP benchmarks on real-world information that can enable malicious use.\\n\\n3. The WMDP Benchmark\\n\\nWe introduce the Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMDP) benchmark, a dataset of 3,668 expert-written, multiple-choice questions in biosecurity (WMDP-Bio), cybersecurity (WMDP-Cyber), and chemistry (WMDP-Chem) costing over $200K to develop. The goal is to reduce question-answer (QA) accuracy on WMDP while maintaining performance on other benchmarks, such as MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2020b) or MT-Bench (Zheng et al., 2023a). See Appendix A.1 for a breakdown of questions in WMDP and Appendix B.1 for a sample question.\\n\\nWMDP is an automatic, public benchmark of hazardous capabilities that serves as a guide for risk mitigation (Section 3.1).

We treat these as a held-out set of private questions with especially hazardous knowledge.\\n\\nWe can evaluate whether WMDP is a proxy for hazardous knowledge by examining if performance on WMDP correlates with performance on the private set.\\n\\nWe follow the QA evaluation described in Section 5.2 and report the performance of ZEPHYR -7 before and after unlearning with RMU on this private set in Figure 13.

The forget loss causes the updated model's activations on D forget (red) to blow up after around 200 steps of RMU, whereas our retain loss regularizes the updated model's activations on the subject-specific D retain sets (Appendix A.6 and A.7; solid blue) to be roughly similar to the frozen model's activations on the subject-specific D retain (dashed blue), suggesting that RMU preserves knowledge on benign data.\"}"}

Generalization of RMU\\n\\nWe evaluate whether RMU prevents finetuning from recovering hazardous knowledge. Our work focuses on the closed-source threat model where LLM providers apply unlearning before LLM serving (Figure 2). We now consider the open-source threat model where LLM providers publicly release the LLM weights. In this setting, adversaries may finetune the model to attempt to recover hazardous capabilities.\\n\\nWe examine if RMU also prevents models from relearning unlearned knowledge through finetuning. In particular, we perform unlearning on Mistral-7B-0.1 (Mistral AI team, 2023) and afterwards finetune on the cybersecurity forget corpus. In practice, we find it difficult to finetune ZEPHYR-7B on our unlabeled corpus due to its instruction-tuning, so we use its base model, Mistral-7B-V0.1.\\n\\nWe finetune until the loss remains steady and report the results of finetuning in Figure 14. We see that RMU is unable to prevent finetuning from recovering performance, and we encourage future work to tackle the challenge of preventing relearning of unlearned knowledge through finetuning.\\n\\nB.6. Baselines\\n\\nWe describe the baselines we employed, and any implementational details we employed for unlearning on RMU.\\n\\nFigure 15. We report the activation norms on $D_{forget}$ and subject-specific $D_{retain}$ and see that RMU increases the norms on hazardous data while preserving the norms on benign data. Note that these subject-specific $D_{retain}$ are not used in the loss calculation. (In particular, see the last two sentences of Section 4.)\"}"}

LLMU\\n\\nWe make several changes in adapting LLMU (Yao et al., 2023b) to our setting. We use bfloat16 for all floating point computations. In the unlearning process we do not stop after a prescribed maximum forget loss, rather stopping after unlearning for exactly a prescribed number of steps. Each sample of our dataset is truncated to 200 characters, and in the random loss we remove the question answer formatting, as our corpora does not follow this format. Using the hyperparameters for Llama 2 (7B) as a starting point, we employ low-rank adaptation (Hu et al., 2021), a batch size of 2, a random weight of 1, and a normal weight of 1. We apply a grid search over the learning rates \\\\([1 \\\\times 10^{-4}, 5 \\\\times 10^{-4}, 1 \\\\times 10^{-3}, 5 \\\\times 10^{-3}]\\\\), the number of steps \\\\([500, 750, 1000]\\\\), and the forget weight \\\\([0.5, 1, 2]\\\\).\\n\\nB.6.2. SCRUB\\n\\nKurmanji et al. (2023) propose SCalable Remembering and Unlearning unBound (SCRUB) for image classification. It uses the original model as a frozen teacher and clones it to form a student model that is adapted for unlearning. SCRUB cycles between forget data and retain data epochs, maximizing KL divergence of logits between the student and teacher model on the forget set, and minimizing it on the retain set. The retain set epochs also includes a task-specific loss with gold labels to maintain performance. We use the same forget set and retain sets as the RMU experiments, and with log perplexity on Wikitext as the task-specific loss. We tune the \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) hyperparameter at values \\\\([1 \\\\times 10^{-4}, 1 \\\\times 10^{-3}, 1 \\\\times 10^{-2}, 1 \\\\times 10^{-1}, 1, 10]\\\\), to search over loss weightings between knowledge distillation and the task-specific loss. We do this as a grid search with learning rates being \\\\([1 \\\\times 10^{-5}, 5 \\\\times 10^{-6}, 2 \\\\times 10^{-6}]\\\\). We use 600 unlearning steps in total, doing the forget step only for 300 as it is recommended in Kurmanji et al. (2023) to stop it earlier. In the high learning rate case, i.e. \\\\(lr = 1 \\\\times 10^{-5}\\\\) we also try doing only 400 unlearning steps in total, with only 100 forget steps. Other than that, we use the same hyperparameters as those reported for LLMU above. Goel et al. (2024) have shown that SCRUB performs poorly when most training samples relevant to removal are not available. This could be one of the reasons why SCRUB performs poorly in our setting.\\n\\nB.6.3. SSD\\n\\nSelective Synaptic Dampening (SSD) (Foster et al., 2024) belongs to a class of methods which find parameters in the model that are differentially more important for the forget set than the retain set. While the method was originally developed for image classification, we adapt it for autoregressive language modeling by altering the loss function to log-perplexity on the forget set and retain set. We grid-search on the threshold \\\\([0, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2.5, 5]\\\\) and constant for dampening \\\\([1 \\\\times 10^{-5}, 1 \\\\times 10^{-4}, 1 \\\\times 10^{-3}, 1 \\\\times 10^{-2}, 1 \\\\times 10^{-1}, 1]\\\\), the two main hyperparameters for SSD. We converged on these ranges after initial manual hyperparameter exploration for our task and datasets.\\n\\nB.6.4. RMU\\n\\nWe perform a hyperparameter search over the layer \\\\(\\\\ell\\\\) to perform the unlearning loss on, starting from the third layer and going to the last layer. We perform a grid search on the number of training batches (i.e., number of gradient updates) in the range of \\\\([150, 300, 500]\\\\). We choose early layers for unlearning (\\\\(\\\\ell = 7\\\\) for ZEPHYR-7B and M7X8-7B, and \\\\(\\\\ell = 15\\\\) for YI-34B). We also tune the \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) weight of the retain loss, setting it to be 1200 for ZEPHYR-7B, 350 for YI-34B, and 1600 for M7X8-7B. We set the unlearning coefficient \\\\(c\\\\) to be 6.5, 300 and 300 respectively. We focus unlearning only on the MLPs, as those encode knowledge in the model.\\n\\nC. MMLU Subset Unlearning Benchmark\\n\\nTo enable further research on unlearning, we provide auxiliary benchmarks via unlearning certain subsets of MMLU, while retaining performance on the remainder of MMLU. We offer three settings:\\n\\n- Economics: Unlearning on high school macroeconomics and high school microeconomics while retaining all other categories of MMLU.\\n- Law: Unlearning on international law and professional law while retaining all other categories of MMLU.\\n- Physics: Unlearning on high school physics, conceptual physics, and college physics while retaining all other categories of MMLU.\"}"}

RMU outperforms baselines, decreasing accuracy on WMDP while maintaining general capabilities; detailed results in Table 2. WMDP and MMLU scores are percents; 25% is random.\\n\\nBaselines. We benchmark RMU against three unlearning baselines: SCRUB (Kurmanji et al., 2023), SSD (Foster et al., 2024), and LLMU (Yao et al., 2023b), on ZEPHYR-7B. Because we found low performance on ZEPHYR-7B, we did not benchmark the baselines on YI-34B or M IXTRAL-8X7B. See Appendix B.6 for implementation details.\\n\\n5.2. Quantitative Evaluation\\n\\nTo assess the efficacy of the methods, we examine the forget performance and retain performance of the unlearned models. We see that RMU is able to unlearn WMDP -Bio and WMDP -Cyber while maintaining performance on MMLU (Figure 8).\\n\\nForget performance. We measure forget performance by evaluating the knowledge of models on WMDP with both question-answering (QA) and probing.\\n\\nQA evaluation. In the future, LLMs may be used by adversaries as knowledge engines for developing weapons. Under an API-access threat model, adversaries only receive output tokens and logits, without access to internal activations. Hence, we evaluate the QA accuracy of models on WMDP. We use a zero-shot question-answer format (Appendix B.1), taking the top logit between A, B, C, and D as the answer choice. For comparison, we also benchmark GPT-4 zero-shot on each of these tasks. As language models are sensitive to the prompting scheme (Sclar et al., 2023), we use lm-evaluation-harness v0.4.2 (Gao et al., 2021) to standardize prompts.\\n\\nQA results. We assess whether RMU is able to reduce QA accuracy on WMDP in Table 1. For both ZEPHYR-7B and YI-34B, RMU is able to drop performance to near random accuracy on WMDP -Bio and WMDP -Cyber, while other baselines struggle to drop accuracy on WMDP -Bio and WMDP -Cyber without crippling performance on MMLU.\\n\\nProbing evaluation. While evaluating QA accuracy measures the primary risk of the API-access threat model, it fails to assess whether knowledge has been fully removed from the models. Models may possess more knowledge than is revealed in their output logits (Burns et al., 2022); for instance, the unlearned model may still retain hazardous knowledge, but refuse to answer. Thus, we test whether unlearned models can be probed to recall unlearned information. We train a 4-way linear probe on the unlearned RMU models. We use half of WMDP -Bio and WMDP -Cyber for training and hold out the other half for evaluation. We apply probing and report results for all layers of the model.\\n\\nProbing results. We assess whether probes are able to recover knowledge from a model unlearned with RMU in Figure 9. Across both categories, linear probing only achieves slightly better than random accuracy. Linear probes are unable to extract unlearned information from the model, suggesting that RMU does not merely mask or hide the information superficially, but rather causes a substantial alteration that prevents the recall of the unlearned information.\\n\\nRetain performance. We measure the retain performance by evaluating models' knowledge on MMLU and their fluency on MT-Bench.\\n\\nMMLU evaluation. To be practical, unlearning methods must maintain general knowledge while removing hazardous knowledge. To evaluate whether models retain general knowledge after unlearning, we reuse the earlier QA evaluation setup for MMLU.\\n\\nMMLU results. We report accuracy on subject-specific areas in MMLU (Figure 11). In contrast to other baselines which either fail to reduce performance on WMDP or greatly reduce performance on MMLU (Figure 10), RMU reduces performance on WMDP while maintaining overall MMLU accuracy. Moreover, Figure 11 shows that RMU retains...\"}"}

However, RMU greatly drops performance on the most similar top-\\nics to biosecurity (virology) and cybersecurity (computer security), suggesting the possibility for future work to improve retention of general capabilities during unlearning. As we use Wikitext as the retain set, RMU cannot determine exactly what knowledge to unlearn and retain. Thus, we encourage future work to employ our subject-specific retain sets (Section 4.2) to improve unlearning precision.\\n\\nMT-Bench evaluation.\\nBeyond retaining performance on academic multiple-choice questions, unlearned models should still maintain general conversational and assistant abilities. We evaluate RMU and all baselines on MT-Bench, a widely used metric for language model conversational fluency and helpfulness. We again evaluate GPT-4 as an upper bound for benchmark performance.\\n\\nMT-Bench results.\\nWe report the MT-Bench performance of all models in Table 1. RMU roughly maintains performance on MT-Bench, with the score only decreasing 0.23 on ZEPHYR -7 B, 0.06 points on Y -34 B, and 0.13 points on M IXTRAL X 7B (out of a total possible of 9). Because RMU still degrades MT-bench performance, particularly on ZEPHYR -7 B, future work could study unlearning methods that can retain general assistant capabilities.\\n\\n5.3. Robustness Evaluation\\nA primary motivation for unlearning is ensuring that knowledge is irrecoverable, even when subject to optimization pressure (Schwinn et al., 2024; Lynch et al., 2024). If unlearning is not resilient, the adversary can still jailbreak the model to access hazardous information after unlearning.\\n\\nWe conduct a qualitative experiment using the GCG adversarial attack (Zou et al., 2023b) to measure whether dangerous knowledge is recoverable after performing RMU . We sample a single prompt from each of the WMDP -Bio and WMDP -Cyber datasets, slightly modify it such that the base Y -34 B models refuse to answer, and identify whether GCG can jailbreak the base and unlearned Y -34 B models to extract the correct answer (Section 5.3).\\n\\nGCG can jailbreak the base Y -34 B models to answer these prompts in less than 50 gradient steps, while the unlearned models output gibberish even after 2,500 steps, or over 7 hours of optimization on an NVIDIA A100 GPU (Figure 12). This is a signal towards the resilience of RMU, suggesting that unlearning persists even under optimization pressure.\\n\\n6. Conclusion\\nWe propose a dataset, WMDP , to evaluate the potential of malicious use in LLMs. WMDP was developed by subject matter experts in biology, cybersecurity, and chemistry, and was filtered to remove sensitive or export-controlled information. Modern LLMs score highly on some aspects of WMDP , suggesting presence of hazardous knowledge.\\n\\nWe propose machine unlearning as a safety intervention to reduce hazardous knowledge.\\n\\nTowards making progress on unlearning, we introduce RMU, an unlearning method that removes hazardous knowledge without significantly compromising general model performance. However, RMU reduces accuracy on closely related fields, such as introductory virology and computer security, demonstrating the need for continued research towards improved unlearning precision.\"}"}

See Appendix D for a fuller discussion of the broader impacts of WMDP.\\n\\nHow WMDP Mitigates Risk\\n\\nUnlearning on WMDP mitigates risk for both closed-source and open-source models.\\n\\nFor closed-source models, unlearning reduces risk from malicious API finetuning (Zhan et al., 2023; Qi et al., 2023; Pelrine et al., 2023), as hazardous knowledge can be removed prior to serving the model. Furthermore, unlearning is a countermeasure against jailbreaks\u2014even if they are jailbroken, unlearned models lack the knowledge necessary to empower malicious users (Figure 2).\\n\\nFor open-source models, unlearning can expunge hazardous knowledge before such models are publicly released, limiting adversaries from repurposing open-source models out of the box. However, unlearning on WMDP does not address the threat model of relearning in open source models. We encourage future work towards mitigating risk in this pathway.\\n\\nStructured API Access\\n\\nWMDP complements the safety benefits of structured API access (Shevlane, 2022), where model developers provide an API for users to query and finetune models without full weight access. In this framework, ordinary users may query and finetune models with an API, but the model provider applies safety mechanisms, such as unlearning, prior to serving the model. However, approved users could obtain API access to the base model with full capabilities under strict guidelines, empowering the use of LLMs for benign or defensive applications while mitigating potential vectors of malicious use. For instance, OpenAI allows access of GPT-4 variants with fewer guardrails for red-teaming and biological malicious use experiments (OpenAI, 2023a; 2024).\\n\\nStructured access mitigates the concern that unlearning dual-use information will harm defenders.\\n\\nStructured access requires model developers to solve the \\\"Know Your Customer\\\" (KYC) challenge, which involves verifying the identity and intentions of customers before allowing them privileged interactions. For structured access, implementing KYC-like procedures can help mitigate the risks associated with malicious use by ensuring that only verified and trustworthy individuals or organizations are given the full capabilities of the model.\\n\\nAcknowledgments\\n\\nWe thank Alexander Sikalov, Adrian Huang, Andrew Papier, Anthony DeLorenzo, Anthony M.
