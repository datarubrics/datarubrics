Overall representativeness $R_O$ of LMs: A higher score (lighter) indicates that, on average across the dataset, the LM's opinion distribution is more similar to that of the total population of survey respondents (Section 4.1). For context, we show the representativeness measures for: (i) demographic groups that are randomly chosen (\u2018avg\u2019) and least representative of the overall US population (\u2018worst\u2019), and (ii) pairs of demographic groups on topics of interest.\\n\\nmore human-aligned using supervised or reinforcement learning (text-*$\\\\text{x}$ and j1-grande-v2-beta) (Ouyang et al., 2022; AI21Labs, 2022).\\n\\nRobustness. In general, LMs can be somewhat sensitive to the formatting of their input prompt (Jiang et al., 2020). We ensure that all our subsequent results are robust to such design choices by replicating our analysis with (i) different prompt templates, and (ii) permuting the order in which answer choices are presented to the model\u2014see Appendix B.4.\\n\\n4.1. Representativeness\\n\\nWe begin by analyzing the default representativeness of LMs, at an overall (does its opinion distribution match that of the overall US populace?) and group level (does it match a particular group\u2019s opinion?). To measure this, we evaluate model opinion distribution on OpinionQA questions without any context (beyond the question itself).\\n\\nThe metric. We define the representativeness of an LM with respect to the overall population as the average alignment (Section 3.2)\u2014across questions\u2014between its default opinion distribution and that of the overall population, i.e.,\\n\\n$$R_O(Q) = A(D_m, D_O, Q).$$\\n\\nAnalogously, we can define the group representativeness of an LM w.r.t. to a particular demographic group $G$ as\\n\\n$$R_G(Q) = A(D_m, D_G, Q).$$\\n\\nA higher overall (group) representativeness score indicates that out-of-the-box, the LM is better aligned with the distribution of viewpoints held by the overall US populace (that group). While the maximum possible of this score is 1, it cannot be achieved for all of the groups. This is due to the fact that there are irreconcilable differences between the opinions of certain groups (e.g., Democrats and Republicans on guns in Figure 1)\u2014making it impossible for the model's opinion distribution $D_m$ to simultaneously match all of them.\\n\\nAre current LMs representative? Figure 2 depicts the overall representativeness scores $R_O$ of different LMs. Overall, we observe that none of the models are perfectly representative of the general populace (of survey respondents). In fact, more recent models trained to be more human-aligned (Ouyang et al., 2022; AI21Labs, 2022) are actually worse\u2014cf. OpenAI\u2019s text-davinci-003 and davinci models. To put these results into context, we compare them to salient human baselines:\\n\\n\u2022 We consider the opinion alignment between each of our 60 demographic groups to the overall populace ($R_O(G)(Q) = A(D_G, D_O, Q)$). We see that each of these groups is more representative of the overall populace than any of the LMs studied (i.e., cf. representativeness scores of \u2018human (worst)\u2019 to all the LMs).\\n\\n\u2022 Second, we construct a scale of alignment values between pairs of demographic groups on questions from specific contentious topics ($R_{G1G2}(Q_T) = A(D_{G1}, D_{G2}, Q_T)$). On this scale, we see that $R_O$ for most models is comparable to the opinion alignment of agnostic and orthodox people on abortion or Democrats and Republicans on climate change.\\n\\nGroup representativeness. The group representativeness scores for all the base LMs share striking similarities\u2014e.g., being most aligned with lower income, moderate, and...\"}"}

Other demographic categories are in Appendix 8.\\n\\nProtestant or Roman Catholic groups. This might be because all these models were trained on snapshots of the internet\u2014and thus mimic similar pools of human writers. While AI21\u2019s HF-tuned model ($j1$-grande-v2-beta) behaves similarly to base LMs, the corresponding OpenAI instruct series models ($text-$) are markedly different. The opinions reflected by these models align more with people who are liberal, high income, well-educated, and not religious or belong to religions other than Buddhists, Muslims, and Hindus. These groups line up with the demographics of the crowd-workers reported in OpenAI\u2019s InstructGPT paper (Ouyang et al., 2022)\u2014e.g., predominantly young Southeast Asian and White with a college degree.\\n\\nFinally, a broader analysis across all the groups in the Pew survey highlights several that have low representativeness scores for all LMs, such as individuals of age 65+, widowed, and high religious attendance (Appendix 8). In the case of age, the InstructGPT paper similarly shows that there were almost no individuals of age 65+ that were part of the crowdsourcing process, and it is likely that the other groups (widowed, high religious attendance) may also be difficult to recruit through standard crowdsourcing vendors.\\n\\nModal representativeness. So far, we saw that human-feedback tuned models (and most notably $text-davinci-003$) are less representative of overall opinions. A closer look at $text-davinci-003$\u2019s\\n\\nFigure 4.\\n\\n(a) The alignment of LM opinions with the actual and modal views of different ideological groups on contentious topics.\\n\\n(b) Steerability of LMs towards specific demographic groups: we compare the group representativeness of models by default (x-axis, $R_Gm$) and with steering $S_Gm$ (y-axis). Each point represents a choice of model $m$ and target group $G$, and points above the $x=y$ line indicate pairs where the model\u2019s opinion alignment improves under steering. Shaded lines indicate linear trends for each model $m$, and we generally observe that models improve from steering ($above x=y$) but the amount of improvement is limited.\\n\\nopinion distribution provides some insight into why this might be the case. Specifically, it has an extremely sharp (and low entropy) opinion distribution for most questions (Appendix Figure 9)\u2014it typically assigns $>0.99$ probability to one of the options. This is unlike humans, who even on contentious topics (like gun rights), tend to exhibit some diversity in opinions (see the Democratic respondent distribution in Figure 1). This prompts us to ask: is $text-davinci-003$ actually unrepresentative, or does it collapse to the most-frequent and modal opinion of certain groups? To test this, we construct a \u201cmodal\u201d opinion distribution of a group by applying temperature scaling to the group\u2019s opinion distribution $D_G(q)$ (Appendix A.5).\\n\\nIn Figure 4a, we then compare the relative tendencies of LMs to match the actual and modal opinions of different political groups on contentious topics. We observe that the\"}"}

This indicates that the dominant approach of aligning LMs with RL based human-feedback not only skews the model's opinions towards certain groups (liberals), but also pushes it to almost embody caricatures of those groups (e.g., 99% approval of Joe Biden). From a different standpoint, this finding highlights the importance of considering the entire spectrum of human responses rather than just the mode. A modal analysis of text-davinci-003 would conclude that the model is highly representative of Democrats, where in reality its representation collapses the diversity of opinions held by different democrats into a single, modal response.\\n\\nRefusals.\\n\\nIn our comparison of human and LM opinions so far, we omitted the \u201crefusal\u201d option for all questions due to its non-ordinal nature. In Appendix B.1, we thus separately compare the refusal rates of LMs and human respondents. We find that all models have low refusal rates. Although human feedback-tuned models are encouraged to refuse to take a stance on contentious issues (Askell et al., 2021; Ouyang et al., 2022), they tend to rarely do so in our multiple-choice setting\u2014with refusal rates as low as 1\u20132%.\\n\\n4.2. Steerability\\n\\nWe now shift our focus from measuring the default alignment of LM opinions with those of various demographics groups without prompting, to studying their steerability with group-specific prompting. This is especially important in settings such as personalization, where a key measure of performance is an LM\u2019s ability to adapt to represent the opinion of various demographic groups.\\n\\nThe metric.\\n\\nWe measure steerability as the average opinion alignment, across questions, between an LM and a particular demographic group $G$\u2014where the model is prompted with group information in its context. Since our goal is to test whether a model can be steered toward a group, we consider three prompting strategies\u2014QA, BIO, PORTRAY (see Section 3.1)\u2014for each question and choose the one that works best. Concretely, we measure steerability as:\\n\\n$$S_{Gm}(Q) = \\\\frac{1}{|Q|} \\\\sum_{q \\\\in Q} \\\\max_{c_{G} \\\\in \\\\{QA, BIO, POR\\\\}} A(D_{m}(q; c_{G}), D_{G}(q))$$\\n\\nwhere $D_{m}(q; c_{G})$ denotes the LM opinion distribution conditioned on the group-specific context $c_{G}$. A higher $S_{Gm}$ score indicates that the model is better aligned to the opinions of that group. Note that unlike default subgroup representativeness, an LM\u2019s steerability could be simultaneously high for multiple (disagreeing) groups. In fact, in many cases, we might want disparities in the default subgroup representativeness scores of an LM to be remedied by steering. Steering does not solve opinion misalignment.\\n\\nWe attempt to steer LMs towards one of 22 demographic groups (e.g., Republican, Asian) in Appendix Table 4 on a subset $Q_{S}$ of 500 highly contentious questions from OpinionQA. In Figure 4b, we compare different LMs in terms of their ability to match the opinions of these subgroups, by default and with steering ($S_{Gm}(Q_{S})$ from Section 4.1).\\n\\nMost LMs (with the exception of ada) do become somewhat more representative of a subpopulation post-steering. However, none of the disparities in group opinion alignment of an LM disappear after steering, with text-davinci-002 showing the smallest post-steering alignment gap across groups. In most cases, we see the representativeness of all groups improving by a constant factor\u2014indicating that the LM still does better on some groups than others. In Appendix Figure 11, we visualize which LMs are most effective at adapting towards a particular group: e.g., j1-grande-v2-beta for Southerners and text-davinci-002 for liberals.\\n\\n4.3. Consistency\\n\\nOur earlier default representativeness analysis (Section 4.1) showed marked skews in the views expressed by LMs, with base LMs reflecting opinions consistent with lower income and education and the opposite for human-feedback tuned ones. However, we might want to go beyond this aggregate analysis and ask: are the views expressed by LMs consistent across topics? (Saris & Sniderman, 2004). For instance, is text-davinci-002 politically Liberal on all matters or does it take a Conservative stance in some cases? We now leverage the fine-grained topic taxonomy in our OpinionQA dataset to answer this question. To this end, we inspect human-LM opinion similarity on a topic level by computing alignment on a subset of questions $Q_{T}$.\\n\\nAre LMs consistent?\\n\\nIn Figure 5, we break down the subgroups that various LMs (columns) most closely align to (colors) across 23 topic categories (rows) by political ideology, education and income. The base models from both providers and the RLHF-trained text-davinci-003 from OpenAI seem to be the most consistent \u2013 albeit towards different sets of groups. None of the models are perfectly consistent however, and even text-davinci-002 aligns with conservatives on topics like religion.\"}"}

The consistency scores of current LMs are fairly low\u2014indicating that they are expressing a patchwork of disparate opinions. Note that this may not always be problematic\u2014after all even individuals can hold seemingly inconsistent beliefs.\\n\\n5. Related work\\n\\nEvaluating LM personas. There has been growing interest in probing LM's ability to mimic human behaviors. One line of work asks whether LMs can replicate results from well-known human experiments, e.g., in cognitive science, social science, and economics (Uchendu et al., 2021; Karra et al., 2022; Aher et al., 2022; Binz & Schulz, 2022; Srvastava et al., 2022). Other studies have examined whether LMs can be used to simulate personas (Park et al., 2022; Argyle et al., 2022; Jiang et al., 2022; Simmons, 2022), akin to our notion of steerability. Through case studies in specific settings, these works gauge whether prompting LMs with demographic information (e.g., political identity) leads to human-like responses: Argyle et al. (2022) look at voting patterns and word associations, and Simmons (2022) consider moral biases. By leveraging public opinion surveys, we are able to improve our understanding of LM steerability in three ways: (i) breadth: both in the range of different topics and steering groups, (ii) distributional view: gauging whether LMs can match the spectrum of opinions of a group rather than its modal opinion, and (iii) measurability: using metrics grounded in human response distributions. Finally, recent works have examined the slants in the opinions of LMs\u2014by prompting them with contentious propositions/questions generated by LMs Perez et al. (2022b) or from political tests Hartmann et al. (2023). Similar to our work, they find that human-feedback trained models often exhibit a left-leaning, pro-environmental stance. However, since our approach is based on public opinion surveys, we can go beyond the modal perspective taken by these works (comparing models to dominant viewpoints of specific groups, e.g., pro-immigration for liberals). We find that these two perspectives can often lead to different conclusions\u2014e.g., text-davinci-003 while very pro-liberal based on the modal view, does not capture liberal viewpoints in a nuanced and consistent manner according to our study.\\n\\nSubjectivity in evaluations.

We put forth a quantitative framework to investigate the opinions reflected by LMs \u2013 by leveraging high-quality public opinion polls. Using this framework, we create OpinionQA, a dataset for evaluating the alignment of LM opinions with those of 60 US demographic groups over topics ranging from abortion to automation. Across topics, we find substantial misalignment between the views reflected by current LMs and those of US demographic groups: on par with the Democrat-Republican divide on climate change. Notably, this misalignment persists even after explicitly steering the LMs towards particular groups. Our analysis not only confirms prior observations about the left-leaning tendencies of some human feedback-tuned LMs, but also surfaces groups whose opinions are poorly reflected by current LMs (e.g., 65+ and widowed individuals).\\n\\n1. Introduction\\n\\nLanguage models (LMs) are becoming ubiquitous in open-ended applications such as dialogue agents and writing assistants. In these settings, LMs have been observed to offer opinions in response to subjective queries: e.g., DeepMind's Sparrow says that the death penalty shouldn't exist (Glaese et al., 2022) while Anthropic's models claim that AI is not an existential threat to humanity (Bai et al., 2022). A priori, it is hard to predict how LMs will respond to such subjective queries. After all, many humans, with myriad opinions, shape these models: from internet users producing the training data, crowdworkers who provide feedback for improving the model, to the model designers themselves. This motivates the central question of our work: Whose opinions (if any) do language models reflect?\\n\\nNote that the answer to this question is an important factor in the success of LMs in open-ended applications. After all, unlike typical benchmark tasks, subjective queries do not have \u201ccorrect\u201d responses that we can direct the model towards. Instead, any response from the model (including refusal) encodes an opinion \u2013 which can affect the user's experience and shape their subsequent beliefs. This suggests that a key evaluation for LMs in open-ended tasks will be not only to assess whether models are human-aligned broadly (Askell et al., 2021; Ouyang et al., 2022) but also to identify whose opinions are reflected by LMs.\\n\\nPrior works hint at the types of human viewpoints that current LMs reflect. For instance, Perez et al. (2022b) and Hartmann et al. (2023) show that in certain contexts (e.g., gun rights and the compass test), LMs express views typically associated with the political left. Another line of recent works (Jiang et al., 2022; Argyle et al., 2022; Simmons, 2022; Hartmann et al., 2023) has shown that with conditioning on demographic attributes (e.g., party affiliation), LMs can mimic certain tendencies of the corresponding groups\u2014e.g., the Presidential candidate they might vote. However, systematically answering our motivating question requires an expansive and quantitative framework for projecting the opinions expressed by LMs onto the space of human opinions. Specifically: (i) identifying topics of public interest to probe models on, and (ii) defining methods for measuring the alignment between LM's responses on these topics to the spectrum of views held by people.\\n\\nOur contributions.\\n\\nWe develop a framework to study the opinions reflected by LMs and their alignment with different human populations. Our approach is built on a simple observation: to characterize LM opinions, we can repurpose well-established tools for studying human opinions. Concretely, the tool we rely on is public opinion surveys, which offers several unique advantages over ad-hoc probing of LMs. The survey topics are chosen by experts; the questions are pre-defined; and responses can be statistically analyzed. We validate this framework by analyzing responses from 60 US demographic groups on 17 topics ranging from abortion to automation. We find that current LMs reflect opinions in a manner that misaligns with those of many US demographic groups.\"}"}

We evaluate 9 LMs (350M to 178B parameters; from AI21 Labs and OpenAI) on this dataset (see Figure 1 for an example), comparing the resulting model opinion distribution on each question with that of the general US populace and of 60 demographic groups therein (e.g., Democrats or 65+ in age). We devise metrics for and analyze human-LM opinion alignment along three axes:\\n\\n1. Representativeness: How aligned is the default LM opinion distribution with the general US population (or a demographic group)?\\n\\nWe find substantial misalignment between the opinions reflected in current LMs and that of the general US populace \u2013 on most topics, LM opinions agree with that of the US populace about as much as Democrats and Republicans on climate change. Moreover, human feedback (HF)-based fine-tuning (Ouyang et al., 2022; AI21Labs, 2022), that is intended to make models more human-aligned, seems to only amplify this misalignment. We also note a substantial shift between base LMs and HF-tuned models in terms of the specific demographic groups that they best align to: towards more liberal (Perez et al., 2022b; Hartmann et al., 2023), educated, and wealthy people. In fact, recent reinforcement learning-based HF models such as text-davinci-003 fail to model the subtleties of human opinions entirely \u2013 they tend to just express the dominant viewpoint of certain groups (e.g., >99% approval rating for Joe Biden). Finally, we identify certain groups that make up a significant portion of the US population that are poorly represented by all models: e.g., 65+, Mormon and widowed.\\n\\n2. Steerability: Can an LM emulate the opinion distribution of a group when appropriately prompted?\\n\\nMost models do tend to become better-aligned with a group when prompted to behave like it. However, these improvements are modest: none of the aforementioned representativeness problems are resolved by steering.\\n\\n3. Consistency: Are the groups LMs align with consistent across topics (Saris & Sniderman, 2004)?\\n\\nAlthough specific LMs are preferentially aligned with certain groups (see 1. above), this skew is not consistent across topics. For instance, even generally liberal models such as text-davinci-00\\\\{2,3\\\\} express conservative views on topics such as religion.\\n\\nA probe rather than a benchmark. Whether these properties are desirable or not is nuanced and application dependent. For instance, while we may not want LMs that can only represent a niche set of opinions, exactly matching the opinions of the US population may not be desirable either. Similarly, steerability, while helpful for personalization, could have undesirable side-effects such as exacerbating polarization and creating echo-chambers (Perez et al., 2022b). We thus view our dataset and metrics as probes to enable developers to better understand model behavior and for users to identify and flag representation failures, and not as a benchmark that should be indiscriminately optimized.\\n\\n2. The OpinionQA Dataset\\n\\nTo curate a dataset on which to probe LM opinions, we must tackle three challenges. First, we must identify topics where these opinions are relevant and curate pertinent questions for them. Next, the questions must be designed such that we can easily extract LM opinions on them\u2014which is challenging if the questions are fully open-ended due to the breadth of possible responses. Finally, we need a reference distribution of human opinions from representative groups to compare LMs to. We now discuss how we can address all these challenges by leveraging public opinion surveys.\\n\\n2.1. The power of surveys\\n\\nThe aforementioned challenges in studying LM opinions also arise when attempting to measure human opinions for research or policymaking. The primary approach for the latter currently is to use public opinion surveys. According to Pew Research: \u201cMuch of what the country [US] knows about its media usage, labor and job markets, educational performance, crime victimization, and social conditions is based on data collected through polls.\u201d These surveys address the first of the three challenges with the help of experts, who identify topics of public interest and carefully design questions to capture the nuances of the topic. To tackle the difficulties associated with analyzing open-ended responses, survey designers craft the questions to be multiple-choice. Finally, surveys determine humans\u2019 opinions on these topics through extensive polling of the public at large. (A further discussion of the meticulous data collection process followed by survey designers is provided in Appendix A.1.)\\n\\nThese factors make public opinion surveys an ideal testbed to study LM opinions, and our work develops methods for querying LMs with these surveys, as well as evaluation metrics for quantifying their alignment w.r.t. human opinions.\\n\\n2.2. Our framework\\n\\nWe now put forth a general methodology to convert multiple-choice public opinion surveys into datasets for evaluating LM opinions. Consider a survey with a set of questions...\"}"}

The next-token log probabilities from the LM are then obtained for each of the answer choices (excluding refusal) and normalized to obtain the model's opinion distribution.

BIO: The group information is provided as a free-text response to a biographic question (e.g., asking about party affiliation), akin to Argyle et al. (2022).\\n\\n3.

In contrast to factual QA tasks, there is no \\\"correct\\\" answer in our setting. Instead, for a model $m$, we are interested in the distribution of model opinions $D_m(q)$ for each question across the set of answer choices. To obtain this, we prompt the model and obtain the next-token log probabilities. Specifically, we measure the log probabilities assigned to each of the answer choices (e.g., 'A', 'B', ... in Figure 1) \u2013 ignoring all other possible completions (See Appendix A.3 for details). For reasons that we will discuss in Section 3.2, we treat the refusal and non-refusal answer choices (\\\"E\\\" and \\\"A\\\"-\\\"D\\\" in Figure 1) separately. Concretely, to compute $D_m(q)$, we exponentiate and normalize the scores for all answer choices except refusal. Then, for questions with a refusal option, we also measure the model's refusal probability as the ratio of the exponentiated log probability of refusal vs. the exponentiated cumulative log probabilities for all the choices (e.g., $\\\\frac{\\\\exp(\\\\text{lp}(E))}{\\\\sum_{o \\\\in \\\\{A,B,C,D,E\\\\}} \\\\exp(\\\\text{lp}(o))}$ for the Figure 1 example).\\n\\n3.2. Evaluating the model's response Aggregating human responses from the opinion surveys, as well as probing LMs, provide us with a set of opinion distributions $D(q)$ (i.e., overall, group-level and per-LM) over the answer choices. To answer our question of whose opinions LMs reflect, we must now define a similarity measure over pairs of such distributions. Although we could use any distributional divergence to compare two distributions, there are some subtleties in the structure of survey questions that we would like to capture. Specifically, unlike standard QA benchmarks, the answer choices to survey questions typically have an ordinal structure (e.g., ranging from \\\"A great deal\\\" to \\\"Not at all\\\", along with a refusal option in Figure 1). This means that divergences for non-metric probability measures such as the Kullback-Liebler or total variation can provide misleading estimates of disagreement. For instance, if all humans answered \\\"A great deal\\\", a model that assigns all its probability mass to \\\"A fair amount\\\" and another one that assigns all its mass to \\\"Not at all\\\" would be incorrectly deemed equally similar based on such measures. We thus choose the 1-Wasserstein distance ($WD$), which for a pair of distributions $D_1$ and $D_2$, is defined as the minimum cost for transforming $D_1$ into $D_2$. Note that here the transformation cost accounts for the similarity between answer choices. To project the ordinal answer choices to a metric space suitable for $WD$, we simply map them to the corresponding positive integers (e.g., $\\\\{\\\\text{\\\\'A\\\\': 1, \\\\text{\\\\'B\\\\': 2, ..., \\\\text{\\\\'D\\\\': 4}}\\\\}$ for Figure 1). There are two exceptions: (i) due to its non-ordinal nature, we omit the 'Refused' option (if present) in computing $WD$ and compare human and model refusals separately, and (ii) if the last option is hedging (e.g., \\\"Neither\\\" and \\\"About the same\\\"), we map it to the to mean of the remaining ordinal keys (see Appendix A.4 for details).\\n\\nMeasuring opinion alignment. We define alignment between two opinion distributions $D_1$ and $D_2$ on a set of questions $Q$ as:\\n\\n$$A(D_1, D_2; Q) = \\\\frac{1}{|Q|} \\\\sum_{q \\\\in Q} \\\\frac{N - 1}{WD(D_1(q), D_2(q))}$$\\n\\nWhere, $N$ is the number of answer choices (excluding refusal) and the normalization factor $N - 1$ is the maximum $WD$ between any pair of distributions in this metric space. This metric is bounded between 0 and 1, with a value of 1 implying a perfect match between the two opinion distributions. In our study, we use this metric to compare the LM opinion distribution $D_m$ to that of all survey respondents ($D_O$) and that of specific groups ($D_G$).\\n\\nOn the use of the term alignment. We use the term alignment to describe our metric as it measures one aspect of alignment \u2014 alignment of opinions and preferences between LMs and humans. Crucially, in contrast to prior work, our work treats human alignment as an inherently subjective quantity that depends on who it is measured against, rather than it being a single quantity that can be improved. In fact, based on our definition, higher human-LM alignment to certain groups might not always be desirable (e.g., matching racist views) or even possible (e.g., aligning with both Democrats and Republicans on abortion) \u2013 see Section 6.\\n\\n4. Whose views do current LMs express? We now evaluate existing models on OpinionQA and analyze their opinion agreement with respect to people in the US. We study a set of 9 LMs\u2014with different providers (OpenAI and AI21 Labs), scales (350M to 178B parameters), data collection, and training strategies. These models can be roughly grouped into (i) base LMs, that have only been pre-trained on internet data (ada, davinci, davinci, j1-grande and j1-jumbo), and (ii) human feedback (HF)-tuned LMs that have been adapted to be\"}"}

Robustness\\n\\nAlthough current LMs perform remarkably well in the zero-shot setting, they are still known to be sensitive to the exact format of their prompt (see Gao et al. (2021); Liang et al. (2022); Srivastava et al. (2022) for extensive evaluations). Thus, one might wonder: Are the distributions we are obtaining from LMs robust to such design choices? Before we delve into this further, it is important to note that humans also exhibit a similar sensitivity. In the context of Pew surveys, human respondents are also sensitive to factors such as option ordering and question formatting. Nevertheless, we test how robust our analysis is to: (i) the order in which options for a question are presented to the model and (ii) prompt formatting. Even though we see small fluctuations in the actual representativeness scores through these interventions, the overall trends remain unchanged\u2014the relative ranking of models and the subgroups they tend to align with.\\n\\nB.4.1. Sensitivity to Option Ordering\\n\\nWe exactly repeat our analysis from the main paper, but present the model with answer choices for a question in a randomly permuted (rather than the default ordinal) order. For instance, for the question in Figure 1, we might present the options as \\\"A: Not too much, B: A great deal, C: A fair amount, D: Not at all\\\". For a given question, the same random permutation is used across LMs.\\n\\nUnder such permutations, we see a small drop in the representativeness scores of all models. We believe that this is at least partly because the reference human distribution is based on survey responses where humans were presented options in an ordinal manner rather than randomly. Since humans are also sensitive to option ordering, we believe this has some effect on the observed human opinion distribution. However, as mentioned above, the overall and subgroup-level trends remain largely consistent as seen from Figure 13.\\n\\nB.4.2. Sensitivity to Prompt Format\\n\\nWe vary prompt we feed into LMs so as to get their opinion distribution. Specifically, before asking the model a question\u2014as in Figure 1, we consider adding a set of instructions. The instructions are in one of two formats:\\n\\n- General: Please read the following multiple-choice question carefully and select ONE of the listed options.\\n- Example: Please read the multiple-choice question below carefully and select ONE of the listed options. Here is an example of the format:\\n\\n```\\nQuestion: Question\\nA. Option 1\\nB. Option 2\\nC. Option 3\\nAnswer: C\\n```\\n\\nIn both cases, the instruction is followed by the question of interest from the dataset. We then repeat our analysis with these prompt variants (where 'standard' denotes our approach from the main paper), focusing on the 500 questions from Section 4.2 computational reasons\u2014see Appendix Figure 14. We only include a subset of demographic attributes in the figure below for brevity, as the results are similar to Appendix Figure 13.\"}"}

Models\\n\\nFor our analysis, we use a series of models from OpenAI and AI21 labs, detailed in Table 5. Since the model training process is not always publicly known, we attempt to report this to the best of our knowledge. Further documentation can be found at beta.openai.com/docs/model-index-for-researchers and docs.ai21.com/docs/.\\n\\nOnce we prompt a model with a given question, we evaluate the log probabilities that each of the answer choices is the next-token. We then take these token log probabilities for each answer, exponentiate and then normalize them to get the model opinion distribution, i.e.,\\n\\n$$D_M = \\\\left[ e^{lp_A}, e^{lp_B}, \\\\ldots, \\\\right] / \\\\sum(e^{lp_A}, e^{lp_B}, \\\\ldots)$$\\n\\nCurrently, OpenAI and AI21 limit the number of log probabilities they return via their API to 100 and 10 respectively. Thus, if one of the option choices (say 'A') is not in the set of returned log probabilities, we attempt to bound it as follows. Let's say the model returns a set of \\\\(K (100 \\\\text{ or } 64)\\\\) token-log probabilities pairs \\\\(\\\\{t_k, lp_k\\\\}\\\\). We compute the total assigned mass as\\n\\n$$p_{\\\\text{assigned}} = \\\\sum_{k \\\\in K} e^{lp_k}.$$\\n\\nThe remaining mass is thus\\n\\n$$p_{\\\\text{missing}} = 1 - M.$$\\n\\nWe also find\\n\\n$$p_{\\\\text{min}} = \\\\min_{k \\\\in K} e^{lp_k},$$\\n\\ni.e., the minimum probability assigned to any of the \\\\(K\\\\) token choices. Then, we assigning the missing token 'A' the probability\\n\\n$$\\\\min(p_{\\\\text{missing}}, p_{\\\\text{min}}).$$\\n\\nNote that this is an upper bound on the true probability mass the model assigns to token 'A'.\\n\\nAs a baseline, we also consider a random model that chooses one of the answers choices per question at random.\\n\\nA.4. Metrics\\n\\nTo compute the Wasserstein distance between human and LM opinion distributions to a question, we must map the options to a metric space. To do so, we leverage the ordinal structure of the options (as provided by Pew surveys). For instance, we would map the set of options 'Strong Agree', 'Agree', 'Maybe', 'Disagree' and 'Strong Disagree' to the integers 1 through 5.\\n\\nWe follow this approach in most cases, with the exception being questions for which the penultimate option is non-ordinal. For instance, if the choices were 'Very good', 'Very bad', and 'Neither good nor bad'. In this case, we map the answers to 1, 2 and 1.5 respectively.\\n\\nA.5. Temperature scaling\\n\\nIn Section 4.1, we compare the model opinion distribution to a sharpened version of its human counterpart. This sharpening makes the human opinion distribution collapse towards its dominant mode. To do so, we use the standard temperature scaling approach from Guo et al. (2017). We use a temperature of 1e-3 in our analysis, but find that our results are fairly robust to the choice of temperature.\"}"}

Consistency of LM opinions $C_m$, where a higher score (lighter) indicates that an LM aligns with the same groups across topics.\\n\\nThere is a growing body of work seeking to make LMs more human-aligned (Askell et al., 2021; Ouyang et al., 2022; Glaese et al., 2022; Bai et al., 2022). While these works recognize the subjectivity of the alignment problem, they do not focus on it\u2014seeking instead to identify values to encode in models and building techniques to do so. Our work looks instead deeper into the issue of subjectivity, asking who are the humans that we are/should be aligning the models to?\\n\\nBias, toxicity, and truthfulness. There is a long line of work studying the bias and fairness of NLP systems (Nadeem et al., 2020; Dhamala et al., 2021; De-Arteaga et al., 2019; Brown et al., 2020; Gao et al., 2021; Srivastava et al., 2022; Liang et al., 2022; Xu et al., 2021; Perez et al., 2022a; Ganguli et al., 2022). These works focus on flagging undesirable outcomes when the gold standard behavior is somewhat well-defined (e.g., don't use slurs). Our work takes a complementary perspective: evaluating LMs on inherently subjective questions taken from Pew Research. This allows us to gain quantitative insights into the representativeness of opinions expressed by LMs on contentious but important topics such as religion or privacy.\\n\\n6. Conclusion\\n\\nWe put forth a framework to examine the opinions reflected by LMs through the lens of public opinion polls. Using our OpinionQA dataset, we identify a number of ways in which LMs are not well-aligned with humans, including overall representativeness with respect to people in the US; subgroup representativeness on groups such as 65+, Mormon, and widowed; and steerability. Our work also contributes to the broader discourse around LMs, including questions of whether instruct-tuning distorts opinion distributions, and whether models hold consistent liberal biases.\\n\\nLimitations\\n\\nWhile our work provides a quantitative lens into LM opinions, it suffers from the limitations below. Alignment. Our approach analyzes LM opinions through the lens of who they align with. This approach allows us to precisely define our metrics and collect data, but also warrants caution \u2013 LMs that perfectly represent human opinions may not necessarily be desirable as they may also, in the process, replicate human biases. We view our metrics as useful ways to understand the behavior of LMs, and not necessarily as benchmarks that should be blindly optimized.\\n\\nATP and surveys. Surveys in general may be sensitive to details such as question specificity (Berinsky, 2017) and the American Trends Panel in particular, which our OpinionQA dataset is based on, has had issues with social desirability bias (Yan, 2021) that may affect the accuracy of the human opinion distribution. Beyond that, our conclusions are only valid for the populations in the US, to which ATP surveys are targeted. Many societies differ from WEIRD (Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich and Democratic) societies such as the United States (Henrich et al., 2010) and there is a need for future work on global equivalents to OpinionQA.\\n\\nMultiple-choice format. We focus on probing LM behaviors using a multiple-choice prompts, which differs from the open-ended text generation setting in which LMs are being increasingly used. It is an open question whether opinion alignment that is measured through multiple choice will be reflected in the downstream use cases of LMs. Some recent works suggest that the group-alignment effects (e.g., to liberals) do reflect in other settings (Perez et al., 2022b; Hartmann et al., 2023), but whether these results transfer broadly warrants further investigation.\\n\\nAcknowledgements\\n\\nWe thank Hazel Markus for initial discussions on studying human values in LMs and leveraging surveys.

Setup and experimental details\\nA.1. Pew research surveys\\n\\nOur dataset is derived from the annual Pew American Trends Panel (ATP) survey. Below, we provide a brief summary of how the data collection process is conducted, and refer the reader to pewresearch.org/our-methods/u-s-surveys/the-american-trends-panel/ and pewresearch.org/our-methods/u-s-surveys/writing-survey-questions/ for more details.\\n\\nPanelists.\\n\\nFor ATP surveys, Pew relies on a group of about 10,000 participants within the US recruited over multiple years, many of whom take the survey repeatedly. Each year, a subset of panelists are invited to take the ATP to reduce the burden on individual respondents. Panelists are offered a paid incentive to participate in the survey.\\n\\nPanelists are recruited by sending participation requests to a randomly-chosen address-based sample of households from USPS's Delivery Sequence File with concerted efforts to ensure representativeness of the sample. They also solicit input from households without internet access\u2014either via phone or by providing them with tablets to take the survey.\\n\\nQuestionairre design.\\n\\nAs stated on the Pew research website: \u201cPerhaps the most important part of the survey process is the creation of questions that accurately measure the opinions, experiences and behaviors of the public...Designing the questionnaire is complicated because surveys can ask about topics in varying degrees of detail, questions can be asked in different ways, and questions asked earlier in a survey may influence how people respond to later questions.\u201d\\n\\nPew research selects pertinent topics for their surveys by monitoring the state of the nation and the world, and identifying issues that would be relevant to the public, media and policymakers. They then go through an iterative process to build questions, often piloting them in focus groups, pre-interviews and cognitive testing. The question wording is highly optimized to be clear, easy-to-understand, and not bias participants towards a particular answer.\\n\\nIn order to identify valid choices for questions, Pew researchers often initially pilot open-ended surveys, and then use them to determine valid answer choices.\\n\\nData quality.\\n\\nEvery survey, once designed is first tested out on a set of 60 \u201cfast\u201d panelists to flag any design errors. Pew researchers also conduct data quality checks to identify issues with respondent satisfaction or the collected answers. The ATP data is also accompanied with sample weights per individual to account for sampling bias and non-response over various stages of data collection.\\n\\nResearchers have observed that human participants are sensitive to question and option ordering. However, for questions with ordinal options (\u201cStrongly agree\u201d...\u201dStrong disagree\u201d), the option ordering is not randomized since they view it as conveying important information.\\n\\nA.2. Adapting ATP to OpinionQA\\n\\nWe derive our questions and human reference distributions based on 15 ATP surveys over multiple years (2017-2021)\u2014see Appendix Table 1 for details. The prefix in each survey name points to the wave in which it was collected. We chose these surveys as they span a broad range of topics that might be pertinent for human-centric LM applications. In Appendix Table 2, we depict the demographic traits that we consider in our sub-group level analysis.\\n\\nPost-processing.\\n\\nAs such, we directly extract multiple-choice questions from Pew ATP surveys and try to apply as little post-processing as possible. Some cases where we must filter or modify the questions are:\\n\\n1. Cross-references:\\n\\nSome questions make explicit references to context provided in a previous question. However, since we are presenting questions to LMs individually, we must modify every question to be self-contained.\\n\\n2. Variable-dependent questions:\\n\\nWe omit questions where the phrasing of the question itself depends on a previous answer: \u201cIn your answer to the previous question, you said $ANSWER. Is this because....\\\"\"}"}
