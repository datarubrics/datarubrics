Introduction\\nSibilants\u2014both fricatives and affricates\u2014appear as one of the last groups of sounds in the process of articulation development in children. Many different types of distortions may occur and persist in their articulation [1, 2, 3]; the speech disorder concerning sibilants is called sigmatism and is diagnosed in approximately 30% of Polish children who manifest speech or language difficulties [4].\\n\\nDue to their common occurrence in different languages as well as their characteristics, sibilants and all the processes and variations that happen in their articulation are often an object of phonetic analyses, mainly concerning acoustic differences between phones [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]. Due to the obvious difficulty in obtaining child speech data, most works investigate the adult pronunciation (e.g., [12, 13, 9, 10, 14]). However, studies concerning child productions are also available [15, 6]. Daniloff et al. [16] investigated the frication noise in disordered productions of /s/ in six English-speaking children. Miccio et al. [17] analyzed spectral moments of English fricatives in a group of ten children with phonological disorders and typical speech development. Works concerning speech disorders in Polish can also be found; most of them focused on clinical approach [18, 3, 2, 19, 20, 4], but some conducted acoustic analysis. Probably the most extensive works on the acoustics of the speech of Polish children were performed by Piotr Lobacz [21, 15]. One of her studies with Dobrzanska [15] presented findings on the fricative formants (spectral peaks in the frication noise band) structure specific for different sibilants. The authors analyzed speech samples from nineteen Polish children (aged 4\u20137) with typical speech development. The results showed that selected sibilant oppositions (e.g., dental vs. retroflex fricatives) are visible in the frequencies of fricative formants and that the process of mastering adult-like articulation of sibilants is more random for affricates than for fricatives.\\n\\nWorks of other authors continued the topic of sibilant pronunciation in children, introducing additional measures describing the frication noise in fricatives\u2014fricative formant levels, formant relations, energies in subsequent subbands of the noise band, or amplitude and frequency of the highest peak in the noise band [22, 23, 24, 25, 26].\\n\\nThe question of how speech science can be employed to support the analysis of speech disorders is still a research topic. Many works on this matter have been published in the last decade (e.g. [8, 27, 24]), proving the relevance and timeliness of the problem.\\n\\n1.1. Contribution of the paper\\nIn this paper, we present the acoustic analysis of voiceless dentals produced by 106 Polish children aged 4;11\u20138;0 (years;months). The speech corpus was collected and annotated by our team consisting of speech engineers and speech and language pathologists (SLP). The analysis was performed based on the speech data collected from children whose articulation of dentals was evaluated as normative (adult-like) or interdental. We aimed to consider two research objectives: 1) the analysis of the acoustic differences in the frication noise in fricative and affricate voiceless dentals and 2) the spectral properties of disordered interdental articulation of considered sibilants compared to the dental norm. The analysis employed the acoustic features of the frication noise proposed in our previous works [24, 25]. The statistical inference was conducted by means of linear-mixed effect models [28].\\n\\n2. Materials\\nThe data analyzed in the study were collected using a multimodal acquisition device that enables audio data recording with fifteen spatially distributed microphones and capturing a video stream using a stereovision module [29]. As the current study is purely acoustic, we used only one signal registered by the central audio channel with the sampling frequency of 44.1 kHz.\\n\\nThe recordings were conducted in several kindergartens and one primary school, and participating children were enrolled in the study without any specific preselection. The project was approved by the local Bioethical Committee. The recording sessions were two-stage and consisted of speech signal acquisition and speech examination performed by an SLP. Speech diagnoses were prepared based on a dedicated questionnaire covering the anatomical and articulation features of the participants.\"}"}

Overall, the speech corpus included over 50 individual words and phrases containing all twelve Polish sibilants in various word positions and acoustic neighborhoods. In this study, we used a six-word subset of the linguistic material (three for each sound /s, t/, see Table 1).\\n\\nThe speech corpus registration process ended in 2023, and the work on data annotation is still in progress. As of the end of February 2024, complete records are available for 133 children initially included in the current study. We grouped these speakers considering the place of articulation of voiceless dental sibilants /s, t/ determined during the speech examination: 1) 83 children showed normative (dental) articulation, 2) 23 children featured interdental articulation (non-normative in Polish), and 3) 27 children presented other, diversified types of articulation.\\n\\nThe subsequent analysis included speakers presenting either normative (dental) or interdental places of articulation, constituting a set of 106 speakers. Table 2 summarizes the speakers' age and gender in both groups.\\n\\n3. Methods\\n\\n3.1. Speech signal processing\\n\\nWe performed segmentation and annotation of sibilants using spectrograms and waveforms. In this process, some utterances were rejected because of the data quality (e.g., when the participant spoke too loudly or laughed). The signals were partitioned into 20 ms frames (10 ms overlap), which we used to calculate a short-time Fourier transform (STFT) with a resulting spectral resolution of 50 Hz. Finally, to verify the hypothesis that the sibilant articulation patterns are reflected in the noise band, we extracted STFT-based acoustic features of the frication noise\u2014fricative formants and their levels, fricative formant relations and distances, amplitude and frequency of the highest peak in the noise band, and energies in subsequent frication bands. The feature extraction was performed according to the procedure described in our previous work [24].\\n\\n3.1.1. Fricative formants and formant-related measures\\n\\nThe fricative formants are maxima of the spectrum envelope (spectral peaks) in the frication noise band. We employed the procedure based on linear predictive coding coefficients described in [24] for their extraction. Four lowest-frequency peaks above the 1800 Hz threshold were selected as the frequencies of four fricative formants (FF\\\\(_{1}\\\\), FF\\\\(_{2}\\\\), FF\\\\(_{3}\\\\), FF\\\\(_{4}\\\\)). The amplitudes (FFL\\\\(_{i}\\\\)) of fricative formants were determined as the mean power spectrum of the FF\\\\(_{i}\\\\) frequency and its two nearest neighbors.\\n\\nFollowing our previous work [24], we employed a set of features based on fricative formants. The ratios of individual formant frequencies (FFR) were calculated as:\\n\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\text{FFR}_{ij} = \\\\frac{\\\\text{FF}_{i}}{\\\\text{FF}_{j}}, \\\\quad 1 \\\\leq i \\\\leq 3, \\\\quad i + 1 \\\\leq j \\\\leq 4,\\n\\\\]\\n\\nand formant level ratios (FLR) were defined accordingly. Both groups comprised six features each as they contained the relations between all non-repeating pairs from the set of four formants.\\n\\nWe also used fricative formant distances (FFD), which reflect bandwidths between consecutive pairs of FFs:\\n\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\text{FFD}_{ij} = \\\\text{FF}_{j} - \\\\text{FF}_{i}, \\\\quad 1 \\\\leq i \\\\leq 3, \\\\quad j = i + 1.\\n\\\\]\\n\\nApart from FF\\\\(_{1}\\\\)\u2013FF\\\\(_{4}\\\\), FFL\\\\(_{1}\\\\)\u2013FFL\\\\(_{4}\\\\), FFR\\\\(_{12}\\\\)\u2013FFR\\\\(_{34}\\\\), FLR\\\\(_{12}\\\\)\u2013FLR\\\\(_{34}\\\\), and FFD\\\\(_{12}\\\\)\u2013FFD\\\\(_{34}\\\\), we applied measures concerning the highest-amplitude peak in the middle-frequency band: a maximum of a power spectrum in the range of 2\u20137 kHz (peak amplitude, PA) and its corresponding frequency (peak frequency, PF). All frequency peaks and frequency-related measures are given in kilohertz.\\n\\n3.1.2. Frication noise energies\\n\\nThe noise energies NE\\\\(_{k}\\\\) were determined for individual sub-bands from 2 to 7 kHz:\\n\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\text{NE}_{k} = \\\\frac{1}{n} \\\\sum_{n=0}^{K-1} |\\\\text{DFT}_n|^2, \\\\quad k = 0, 1, 2, ..., K-1,\\n\\\\]\\n\\nwhere \\\\(n_l,k\\\\) and \\\\(n_u,k\\\\) indicate the spectrum bins related to cut-off frequencies of the \\\\(k\\\\)-th DFT subband, and \\\\(K = 10\\\\) is the number of subbands with a width of 500 Hz.\"}"}

Statistical analysis\\nWe performed statistical analysis using linear mixed-effect (LME) models. To assess the acoustic differences between frication noise in fricative and affricate productions and the impact of interdentality on the frication noise, we employed speech samples from children presenting interdental or normative (dental) places of articulation. To consider the most reliable part of the sound, we dropped 30% of the frames at the beginning and 30% at the end of the frication segment, including the remaining 40% in the analysis. The final number of frames used for modeling is presented in Table 2.\\n\\nLME models were calculated for each of the 35 acoustic features presented in Section 3. To capture the characteristics of the data and choose the best fit, we analyzed various model structures. Our main assumptions are given below.\\n\\n- **Fixed effects:**\\n  - Phoneme = {/s/, /\u0163/},\\n  - ArticulationPlace = {dental, interdental},\\n  - the interaction of Phoneme and ArticulationPlace.\\n\\n- **Random structure:**\\n  - Speaker as random intercept,\\n  - by-speaker random slopes for Phoneme, WordPosition, Stress, FollowingVowel, and interactions between them,\\n  - Word as random intercept,\\n  - by-word random slopes for ArticulationPlace and Speaker.\\n\\nSome of the models were too complex to converge or did not fit the data properly, as the normality of residuals was not sustained. We compared the models and, based on log-likelihoods, selected a model including two fixed effects: Phoneme and ArticulationPlace and a random structure (1 + FollowingVowel + Phoneme + WordPosition Speaker) + (Articulation Word). All analyses were performed in MATLAB R2023b at p = 0.05.\\n\\n4. Results & Discussion\\nAll the analyzed acoustic features are descriptors of the frication noise band (from 2 kHz to around 10 kHz) and reflect the spectral envelope of the signal shaped mainly by the positions of articulators during speech. As a result of LME modeling, we obtained a statistically significant effect for either Phoneme = {/s/, /\u0163/} or ArticulationPlace = {dental, interdental} in twenty out of the 35 features under consideration (Table 3). Two investigated phonemes share the place of articulation (dental) but differ in the manner of articulation. The differences between their productions were found mainly in the medium subband of the frication\u2014in the noise energy between 4.5 and 6 kHz (NE 5\u2013NE 7) and in features describing the second fricative formant, both in terms of its location on the frequency scale (FF 2, FFR 12, FFR 23, FFR 24, FFD 12, FFD 23) and its amplitude (FLR 12).\\n\\nIn turn, differences between dental and interdental productions were primarily found in the lower subband of the frication noise. Compared to dental productions, interdentality showed significantly higher energies in the 2\u20133.5 kHz subband (NE 0\u2013NE 2), and then lower energies over 5.5 kHz (NE 7\u2013NE 8). The frequency of the fourth fricative formant (FF 4) in interdental samples is shifted towards higher frequencies. The significant effect for fricative formant level ratios (lower in interdentality...\"}"}

The median and interquartile range (IQR) are given next to each box in a format: median (IQR). Whiskers refer to 1.5 \u00b7 IQR.\\n\\nThe impact of interdentality on the spectral envelope can also be observed in the fricative formants. Fig. 1 presents distributions (medians and interquartile ranges) of fricative formant frequencies. The FF2 \u2013 FF4 are more scattered in interdental productions\u2014the interquartile ranges are apparently larger than in corresponding dental observations, which suggests that in this speech disorder, the frequency peaks are distributed more randomly, and the formant patterns are not so clearly outlined.\\n\\nBy the estimates from the LME model, medians of FF2 are lower for affricates, both in dental and interdental productions, and interdentality features higher values of FF4 than normative articulation samples.\\n\\nWe expected that the acoustic difference between the places of articulation (dental/interdental) would be phoneme-dependent, as it was previously reported that the development of affricates in children is slower than that of fricatives [15]. Thus, we initially included an interaction Phoneme * ArticulationPlace in the evaluated LME models. However, as the interaction proved to be insignificant for all acoustic features, we dropped it and decided to present the results for the individual effects only.\\n\\nOur findings confirm Lobacz and Dobrzanska's claim that the frication noise in the fricative and the corresponding affricate (sharing the same place of articulation and voicing) is not identical [15]. To verify whether our observations are not a matter of investigating interdentality at the same time, we tested an additional set of LME models calculated only for 83 speakers with normative (dental) articulation of analyzed phonemes, thus excluding the place of articulation from the analysis. The modeling showed the same results as presented in Table 3 with two extra significant differences between productions of /s/ and /\u0163/ (for FF1 and FFL3). Eventually, we decided to describe and present a more comprehensive model that takes both fixed effects into consideration. However, the consistency between the results confirms that a potential interaction between the place of articulation and the manner of articulation (fricative vs. affricate) is insignificant or even non-existent in the investigated case.\\n\\nThe most important limitation of our study was the language material, comprising only six words. This restraint resulted from the limited availability of Polish words that contain the investigated sounds in uniform acoustic neighborhoods and are present in the active vocabulary of preschool children. In the future, we aim to perform more comprehensive analyses, including various phonetic contexts. We are still in a labor-intensive data annotation process, which is why not all our data are available for the current analysis. Still, according to our knowledge, the group of 106 children constitutes the largest population of child speakers included in an acoustic study of Polish sibilants' articulation so far. When the dataset annotation is complete, we plan to verify the results and extend the analysis with articulation patterns that are currently underrepresented.\\n\\n5. Conclusion\\nThe presented study showed significant acoustic differences between frication noise characteristics in voiceless dental fricative /s/ and affricate /\u0163/ produced by children. Experiments based on the speech samples of 106 Polish children proved that the place of articulation (dental/interdental) can also be distinguished based on spectral features of the frication band. This finding may be employed in computer-aided speech diagnosis tools in the future, as acoustic features characteristic of various ways of phoneme realization can serve as advanced predictors in expert systems based on artificial intelligence.\\n\\n6.
