A picture-naming task was conducted with Japanese-learning preschoolers of three and four years old. The empirical data presented in this study allow us not only to make comparisons with the data from 4 year-olds in a previous study, but also to address the devoicing patterns for the 3-year-old children, which have received little attention in the developmental literature on HVD.\\n\\nThe results of twenty children reveal distinct patterns depending on position; word-medially, the overall occurrence of HVD increases if we compare the average HVD rates between the ages of 3 and 4, but their rate is not yet reached at the adult-like level at the age of four. Word-finally, on the other hand, the rates are overall lower than the word-medial devoicing. Further, unlike the incremental pattern observed in the rates for the word-medial devoicing, no clear developmental advancement is found in this position.\\n\\nThe presence or absence of the developmental advancement appears to support the qualitative differences between two types of HVDs in distinct positions.\\n\\nIndex Terms: acquisition, high vowel devoicing, developmental advancement, Japanese\\n\\n1. Introduction\\n\\nChildren take time to acquire adult-like speech. The development of child phonology furthermore comes in different stages, depending on the aspects of phonology. For example, certain sounds and contrasts are acquired earlier than others (see Dunbar and Idsardi [1] for a review). In this paper, we investigate how children acquire the segmental phonetics of the language by focusing particularly on high vowel devoicing (HVD) in Japanese. In what follows, Japanese refers to the standard Japanese (unless otherwise noted), which is the accent used in Tokyo and nearby areas.\\n\\nIn adult speech, among the five short vowels in Japanese, /i/, /e/, /a/, /o/, /u/, high vowels /i/ and /u/ are often devoiced. Maekawa and Kikuchi [2] (Table 2 on p. 210) reports that in the Corpus of Spontaneous Japanese, overall, /i/ and /u/ are devoiced 19.72% and 31.41% of the time, respectively, while /e/, /o/, and /a/ are devoiced 1.29%, 1.28%, and 1.09% of the time, respectively. It is also known that this vowel devoicing often occurs between voiceless consonants (e.g., /kusa' [k\u026f\u0325sa]'grass') and word-finally after a voiceless consonant (e.g., /ha'\u0255i [ha\u0255i\u0325] 'chopstick(s)') (see [3] and [4] for an overview and references). Among these two environments, the former is more studied and HVD is robust there: For example, in the Corpus of Spontaneous Japanese mentioned above, Maekawa and Kikuchi [2] (p. 211, Table 3) report that /i/ and /u/ are devoiced between voiceless consonants 89.15% and 84.25% of the time, respectively (cf. /e/, /o/, and /a/ are devoiced at 3.31%, 3.45%, and 2.10%, respectively). Although the devoicing rates are high, they are not 100%, and thus this is a variable phenomenon and there are many phonological and extra-linguistic factors that have been reported as inhibiting devoicing (see, for example, [3] and [4] for a review of the inhibiting factors).\\n\\nTherefore, the task for Japanese children is to acquire, among other phonological aspects, HVD as exhibited in the adult speech in their community, including the variability accounted for by factors for inhibiting devoicing. There are only a few past works to our knowledge regarding the development of vowel devoicing in Japanese.\\n\\nOta [5] (p. 89), looking at four Japanese children longitudinally (1;0-2;0, 1;4-2;0, 1;5-2;6, 1;5-2;3), found that the syllables that were in the devoicing environments in adult speech were frequently missing in the production of child speech and that the omission rates in this condition were significantly higher than the rate of syllable omission when the target vowels were not in the devoicing environments in adult speech. This suggests that children in the age of one to two years often delete the syllable with the devoiceable vowel instead of devoicing the vowel. It is interesting that among the examples shown in Ota [5] (example (25), p. 89), words that are longer than two syllables result in geminates (e.g., adult expected form [dek\u0325i\u0325ta]'done' \u00e0 child production [detta], not *[deta]), meaning that although the syllable is deleted, the mora is not deleted and remains intact in the structure. (Cf. in bimoraic words the entire syllable is deleted with the devoiceable vowel (e.g., adult expected form [k\u026f\u0325t\u0283i]'mouth' \u00e0 child production [t\u0283i]) presumably because gemination is not possible word-initially in Japanese.)\\n\\nImaizumi et al. [6] conducted an experiment with 72 children of 4 and 5 years of age and 37 adults in two dialects in Japanese, i.e., Tokyo and Osaka dialects. They examined the devoicing rates for four words that contained devoiceable vowels. Focusing on the Tokyo dialect, they found that the devoicing rates of adults and 5-year-olds were significantly higher than the rate of 4 year-olds, concluding that children increase devoicing rates and reach at the adult-like level by the age of 5 years.\\n\\nHirayama [7] examined the HVD rates in a longitudinal production data of one female child in Tokyo Japanese (taken from the NTT Infant Speech Database) from her 12 to 25...\"}"}

She looked at both the word-medial and word-final (before a pause) environments (see discussion above) and found that these two environments exhibit different patterning. Word-medially (between voiceless consonants, also including the environment of a following voiceless geminate), devoicing begins at about month 15, and up till 2;1 years (25 month) devoicing rates were not particularly high, but at the age of 2;3 years (27 month) there was advancement in the devoicing rates to over 60%, and finally at month 48 (4;0 years), the rate was over 70%.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the devoicing rates in the word-final position before pause saw no particular developmental advancement in the data months examined. Also, at month 48, the devoicing rate was much lower (slightly over 40%), than the word-medial devoicing rate.\\n\\nGiven the literature as discussed above, this study investigates the HVD rates in the word-medial and word-final environments separately in children of the age of 3 and 4 years. This dataset will allow us to make comparisons with the data from 4 year-olds in Imaizumi et al. [6] and also fill in a gap in the literature, which is the devoicing patterns for the age of 3 years. The paper is structured as follows. In section 2, we present the data and methodology for the production experiment we conducted. Section 3 reports the results and they are discussed in section 4. Section 5 is a brief summary of the paper.\\n\\n2. Production test\\n\\n2.1. Participants and procedure\\n\\nTwenty Japanese learning children were recorded in a sound attenuated booth at the Lab of Language Development at XX. They were all typically developing children of age 3 (mean 3;4, range: 3;1-3;9) and 4 (mean 4;6, range: 4;1-4;11). The twenty children and their mothers were born and raised in Tokyo or surrounding areas. Each child was seated in front of a table with pictures. A short conversation was held to make a child become familiar with the experimenter and the environment. Speech materials were recorded through interactions between a child and an experimenter using the images; An experimenter asked a participant to name the item of the picture provided. Mothers occasionally interacted with their children during the recording session in order to make them to feel more comfortable in the environment, but naming errors were not corrected. No time limit was set as the latency or the precision of naming production was not the primary purpose of this study. Recording was made with a Marantz digital recorder (PMD 561) and a lavalier microphone (AT831b). Words masked with noise or laughter, disfluent or whispered utterances were excluded from the analysis.\\n\\n2.2. Material\\n\\nThirty-five pictures were provided representing familiar words that begin with various consonants in a picture-naming task. Children did not always produce intended words. Also, not all the words that were collected in the recording involve devoicing environments as the pictures were created to investigate more general acoustic characteristics of preschoolers' speech in Japanese. In the current study, only words involving devoiceable vowels were extracted and further analyzed. Example words containing a devoiceable vowel were given in Table 1. It should be noted that some utterances were not intended to collect, but included in the analysis if they were clearly uttered and met the devoicing condition. E.g., keeki. suki 'cake. (I) like (it)'.\\n\\n| Target vowels in the HVD environments are indicated by bold letters. |\\n|---|\\n| **Table 1**: Example words involving a devoiceable vowel. |\\n| Target vowels in the HVD environments are indicated by bold letters. |\"}"}

As this realization is observed in the HVD environment (5, 7).\\n\\n3. Results\\n\\nTable 2 below presents mean rates of HVD occurrence in each age group, separately by the devoicing positions. Overall, HVD occurred more frequently in the medial position regardless of the age. Nonetheless, large deviations, particularly among 3-year-olds, necessitate careful examination of the distribution of HVD rates as a function of age in months.\\n\\nTable 2: Mean devoicing rates by position of vowel and age.

In the word-medial position, the rates ranged from 0% to 100% among younger children (37 months to 45 months), exhibiting notably greater inter-speaker variation. Interestingly, the rates tend to converge in the older group (49 months to 59 months), and seem to correlate with the age.\\n\\nFigure 3: Rate of HVD occurrence as a function of age in months in the medial position.\\n\\nTurning to the word-final position, the overall rates of HVD are quite lower compared to those in the word-medial position, rendering 19.1% of HVD rate on average. Perhaps more interestingly, Figure 4 below displays no noticeable developmental advancement in this position. This result suggests that HVD in this particular environment may occur regardless of the language development.\\n\\nFigure 4: Rate of HVD occurrence as a function of age in month in the final position.\\n\\nThe rates of HVD occurrence in the word-medial position as a function of age in months exhibit a linear relationship.\\n\\n4. Discussion\\n\\nIn this study, devoicing rates of Japanese children of the age of three and four years were examined. Overall, i.e., word-medial and word-final environments altogether, devoicing rates were 27.7% and 42.6% for the 3rd year and 4th year olds, respectively. Word-medially, the rates were 50.0% and 74.3% on average for the ages of 3 and 4 years, respectively, with an increase from the 3rd to 4th years, although there was much inter-speaker variation especially for the younger group. Gemination instead of devoicing was found, but it was observed for only two and three children in the age of 3 and 4 years, respectively; furthermore, gemination rates were low overall (3.06% and 2.90% averaged over all children at the age of 3 and 4, respectively). Word-finally before a pause, the devoicing rates were much lower than word-medial devoicing, at 15.0% and 22.9% for the 3rd and 4th year olds, respectively.\"}"}

In Hirayama [7] in two aspects. First, the rates were overall lower than the average medial devoicing. Second, there does not appear to be any effect of finality in Japanese (e.g., boundary tones, final particles), and the lengthening is one of them. If this is on the right track, the same patterning is expected in adult speech. In fact, in our study, many tokens were uttered with such additional lengthening on the final position (before and after a pause) that it may be reasonable that the lengthening of the vowel inhibits devoicing. The lower rates may also allow us to better understand the phonology of vowel devoicing in general, and also the phonological phenomena for different processes\u2014words and across words\u2014of devoicing in Japanese.\\n\\nIn our study, gemination was hardly found, only for two and three of the mothers on their side. Yet, it is necessary to expand the scope of the investigation to include spontaneous speech and children's productions in general. While most of the literature has focused on the production of quite young children in two different dialects of Japanese [6], [7], this study investigated the developmental path of HVD in Japanese: a case study of a 1-year-old child [8].\\n\\nIn our results, the developmental advancement of the kind that we observe in the study was only above 80% (see section 1). The rate for the age of 4 years is much higher compared with those in Hirayama's [7] data at the 48th month stage. The rate for the age of 4 years is also comparable with those in Hirayama's data (47%). One reason for the lower rates of HVD in the current study is the higher rates of phrase finality in Japanese (e.g., boundary tones, final particles), and the lengthening is one of them. If the vowel devoicing targets high vowels more often than the low vowels, it may be reasonable that the lengthening of the vowel inhibits vowel devoicing. It would be important to research more on the adult production of HVD in Japanese. While the focus in this study was on the age of 4 years, we have presented the results of a corpus-based study of spontaneous speech to investigate the effects of boundary and final devoicing. This will reveal that HVD in distinct environments are qualitatively different in the adult speech compared with children's speech. Another possibility is that HVD in different processes\u2014words and across words\u2014of devoicing in general, and also the phonological phenomena for different processes\u2014words and across words\u2014of devoicing in Japanese: Two production experiments [1].\\n\\nIndeed, Kilbourn [2] found\u2014in two different dialects of Japanese\u2014that devoicing in the consonantal environment in adult utterances, we found much more inter-speaker variation for the 3 year olds (50.0%) (Figure 3) than the other vowels because they are shorter, it may be likely that variability in HVD is qualitatively different in the adult speech and variability in Japanese high vowel devoicing,\"}"}
