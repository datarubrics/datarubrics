While the research excluded fully pre-voiced tokens due to measurement difficulties, the current study included such tokens by using the method proposed in an earlier study. We also measured the onset F0 of the following vowel and preceding vowel duration to discuss the possibility of secondary cues for the voicing contrast. Our result confirmed the overlap in VOT values in the positive region, which agrees with our previous result, and revealed another overlap in the negative region from the fully pre-voiced tokens newly added in the current study. Moreover, a positive linear correlation between VOT and F0, known as consonant-intrinsic F0 (CF0), was observed in Tohoku Japanese. Although our results did not support either F0 of the following vowel or the preceding vowel duration as a secondary cue, investigating acoustic cues may contribute to further increasing our understanding of Tohoku Japanese.\\n\\n**Index Terms:** intervocalic voicing, neutralization, Tohoku dialects, VOT, onset F0\\n\\n1. **Introduction**\\n\\nVoicing neutralization of stops in the intervocalic position has been reported in the Tohoku dialects of Japanese [1-4]; this is considered voicing assimilation with the neighboring vowels and distinguishes Tohoku dialects from other dialects of Japanese. [1] showed that the distribution of voice onset time (VOT) in the word-medial intervocalic voiceless stops, /t/ and /k/, overlapped with that in the word-medial voiced stops, /d/ and /\u0261/, while the VOT of the word-initial stops showed a bimodal distribution. However, [1] did not include the fully pre-voiced tokens\u2014in which the voicing was present throughout the closure\u2014in their analysis due to measurement difficulties with regard to defining the onset of voicing, thus resulting in fewer word-medial voiced stops than the word-medial intervocalic voiceless stops. Consequently, most cases with negative VOTs, which included approximately 15% of all target segments and more than 60% of the voiced segments, could not be discussed properly. To include the fully pre-voiced tokens, we used the same dataset as that used in [1], which was originally collected for [5], and measured the VOTs of the fully pre-voiced tokens as described in [6]. The first aim of the current study was to reveal the distribution pattern of pre-voiced stops and its effect on voicing neutralization.\\n\\nThe covariation of VOT with the following vowel onset F0 has been reported in many languages [7-10] and is referred to as consonant-intrinsic F0 (CF0). CF0 is mainly considered a result of F0 raising after voiceless consonants induced by physiological factors. However, in Tokyo Japanese, [11] found the onset F0 difference only in the word-initial position, where the word-initial voiced stops were frequently devoiced. They concluded that the F0 perturbation in Tokyo Japanese could be caused not only by automatic and biomechanical factors, but also due to speakers' intention to enhance the voicing distinction. In some contexts, F0 lowering after voiced obstruents has also been observed [12,13] to enhance the laryngeal contrasts of phonemes. Thus, the second aim of the current study was to measure the onset F0 of vowels following stops to investigate the covariation of VOT with F0 and discuss the possibility that F0 perturbation could be triggered by voicing neutralization toward the voiced consonants in Tohoku Japanese.\\n\\nPrevious vowel duration could also be a secondary cue for the laryngeal contrasts, as observed in American English [14,15]. Therefore, the third aim of the current study was to measure the preceding vowel duration to investigate its relationship with the VOT of the following consonant.\\n\\n2. **Method**\\n\\n2.1. Recordings and participants\\n\\nWe used the speech data collected for another study by one of the authors from 2012 to 2016 [5]. The recording sites included eight cities (Aizuwakamatsu, Akita, Aomori, Hachinohe, Ichinoseki, Kamaishi, Morioka, and Tsuruoka) in five Tohoku prefectures. The total number of participants was 23, and their ages ranged from 33 to 85 years (M = 61.30, SD = 15.74). The recording was conducted with a SONY ECM-MS957 microphone on a SONY PCMD50 recorder (16bit, 44kHz).\"}"}

Materials and procedures\\n\\nParticipants were instructed to orally name objects displayed in pictures (picture task) or objects described by the experimenter (riddle task) in their usual spoken language. We selected and analyzed words containing the target coronal or velar stops (/t, d, k, \u0261/) and excluded the ones following a nasal consonant to avoid a nasalization effect, although the other prosodic context was not controlled for. In addition to the picture task data analyzed in [1], we added the riddle task data to increase the number of velar consonants. In both tasks, the tokens were pronounced by themselves and not embedded in a carrier sentence. Each token was designed to be elicited once, but when corrected explicitly, the second utterance was used for analysis.\\n\\nTable 1 presents the set of expected words used in the riddle task, which were described to participants. Even when participants produced a different word from the expected one, if it contained a coronal or velar stop, the relevant word was included in the analysis. Consequently, the total number of analyzed words was 152.\\n\\nTable 1: Word list.\\n\\n- kagami, kagi, kogu, kage, kago, shoogakkoo, kootoogakkoo, dagakki, kumorigarasu, -ginkoo*, -gun*, kurogoma, takikomigohan, shibugaki, nogiku, nagagutsu, asageeko, fufugenka, gikkurigoshi, manga, ongaku, ringo, nyuugakushiki, shoogatsu*\\n\\n* indicates the head noun of the compound words, which varied by participant.\\n\\nThe audio files of the target words were resampled to 16kHz for semi-automatic segmentation using Julius [16]. The system produced annotation files (.lab), from the audio and corresponding text files with transcriptions, and a Python script converted the annotation files into the TextGrid format. A trained phonetician checked the files with Praat [17] and fixed the results wherever necessary. Another phonetician confirmed those changes. The data from the previous study [1] with the target words were also added.\\n\\nVOT values were measured by marking the onset of a release burst and the voicing onset based on the visible concentration of energy below the 1kHz range. For fully prevoiced tokens, the closure duration where voicing persisted was measured as VOT, as proposed by [6]. We also measured and listed the first 10 F0 values of the vowel following each target segment every 10ms in Hz with Praat. F0 values that were doubled or halved to the adjacent values were judged as potential measurement errors and checked and manually corrected. After that, onset F0 values were converted to semitones, which are ratios to each speaker\u2019s mean onset F0, using the same method as in [10]. Outliers were defined as values that are more than 2.5 standard deviations from the mean of each participant, and the segments with missing values were excluded. Consequently, the data described in Table 2 were used for statistical analyses.\\n\\nTable 2: Number of tokens\\n\\n|        | /t/ | /d/ | /k/ | /\u0261/ |\\n|--------|-----|-----|-----|-----|\\n| Initial| 60  | 41  | 317 | 40  |\\n| Medial | 134 | 62  | 684 | 443 |\"}"}

VOT was added as a fixed factor for investigating the VOT and F0 covariation. Other factors were identical to those of the previous model, except for another random factor word: city, which was added due to the potential effect caused by lexical accent differences in each region that might significantly affect the VOT value. The results showed that semitones were positively correlated to VOTs. Longer VOT elicited a higher semitone ($\\\\beta = 5.727 \\\\times 10^{-4}$, $SE = 2.854 \\\\times 10^{-4}$, $z = 2.007$, $p < .001$). There was also an interaction between VOT and position, showing that the change of VOT and F0 was also affected by its position in words ($\\\\beta = 7.810 \\\\times 10^{-4}$, $SE = 3.095 \\\\times 10^{-4}$, $z = -2.523$, $p = .012$).\\n\\nAnother model with lexical voicing as a fixed factor was created to investigate the phonological effect on VOT and F0 covariation.

The interaction between voicing and position in words was also significant ($\\\\beta = -0.137$, $SE = 0.031$, $z = -4.455$, $p < .001$). However, lexically voiced and voiceless consonants in the word-medial condition did not show a significant difference in pairwise comparisons ($\\\\beta = 0.013$, $SE = 0.013$, $z = -0.979$, $p = 1.000$).\\n\\n3.3.

The fixed factors were VOT, articulation place (alveolar/velar), and vowel length (short/long), and the random factors included participant, item, age, sex, and city as in the previous models. The segment type before the target measuring vowel was also added as a random factor to correctly value the possible effect caused by segmental differences. Only word-medial consonants were analyzed since word-initial consonants could not be followed by a vowel. No significance\"}"}

Discussion\\n\\nThe VOTs of /t, d, k, \u0261/ in the word-medial position showed a bimodal distribution (Figure 2). The peaks for the voiced and voiceless segments were at around -60ms and 30ms, respectively. Some cases of voiceless consonants had negative VOTs up to under -100ms. Furthermore, there was an overlap between voiced and voiceless consonants in the positive region (around 0 to 60ms), which was reported in our previous study [1], and this is compatible with the results regarding the word-initial stops in Tohoku Japanese [22]. According to [22], the overlap between voiced and voiceless VOT values was observed at around 30ms, which is congruent with the word-medial results of the current study.\\n\\nFigure 6: VOT polarity by participants: Word-medial /d, \u0261/ (top panel) and /t, k/ (bottom panel).\\n\\nFigure 6 shows the VOT polarity of the word-medial /d, \u0261/ (top panel) and /t, k/ (bottom panel) for study participants. It seems to depend on individual speakers; however, for the word-medial voiced stops, short-lag (positive) VOT was used in 0% to 50% of all voiced stops. For the word-medial voiceless stops, 13 out of the 23 speakers (57%) used non-positive VOTs for the voiceless stops. This suggests that, although voicing neutralization has been reported as a salient characteristic of Tohoku Japanese [1-4], the number of speakers who showed voicing neutralization\u2014which only implies that the lexically voiceless segments have a non-positive VOT\u2014is limited, and even with those speakers, the neutralization rate is not very high (33% maximum). Thus, it is necessary to consider whether the overlap that appeared in the positive region could be regarded as a voicing neutralization in further discussions of the neutralization of Tohoku Japanese.\\n\\n4.2 Relationship between VOT and F0\\n\\nThe onset F0 following the stop consonants confirmed the covariation of VOT and F0 (see Figure 3 and the accompanying statistical analysis), known as consonant-intrinsic F0 (CF0) [7-10]. The statistical analysis showed a positive linear correlation between VOT and F0, which is mainly attributable to physiological factors. We then analyzed the relationship between VOT and F0 under conditions of lexical voicing contrast to investigate whether F0 could be a secondary cue to compensate for the weakened contrast by VOT, as seen in Tokyo Japanese [11]. Figure 4 and the accompanying statistical analysis showed no F0 difference between the word-medial voiced and voiceless contrast. Thus, no evidence was found to support F0 as a secondary cue to enhance voicing contrast.\\n\\nRegarding the VOT overlap in the positive region, it is unclear how, if possible, the speakers of Tohoku Japanese distinguish the pre-voiced segments from the short-lag segments or the short-lag segments from the voiceless segments with a relatively short VOT. In terms of the VOT overlap in the negative region, VOT alone is apparently insufficient for distinguishing the voicing contrast. Further investigation is needed to ascertain whether there is a secondary cue to distinguish the voicing contrast. Perception experiments might provide evidence for other cues. Furthermore, the potential effect of lexical pitch accent was assessed by adding word-city interaction as a random factor, assuming that participants from the same city shared the same pitch accent pattern. Lexical pitch accent should be treated more thoroughly to confirm the F0 effect on VOT. Other factors, such as nasalization of the consonant, which is one of the cues to distinguish the voicing contrast in some cities, should also be examined collectively.\\n\\n4.3 Preceding vowel duration\\n\\nThe preceding vowel duration was measured, and no relation was found with the following consonant voicing (see Figure 5 and the accompanying statistical analysis). This is predictable because, unlike in American English, where the preceding vowel length is a secondary cue for the voicing contrast [14, 15], Japanese has a long and short vowel phonemic contrast. Thus, the vowel length should not be changed to compensate for the primary cue of the following segment as it must maintain its own length contrast.\\n\\n5. Conclusions\\n\\nThis study investigated intervocalic voicing neutralization in Tohoku Japanese and found that the VOT values overlapped in the positive and negative regions. The VOT and F0 covariation was confirmed, but no evidence supported the supposition that F0 perturbation enhances the voicing neutralization. In the future, more data should be analyzed from all sites across the Tohoku district, and sociolinguistic factors should be discussed.\\n\\n6.
