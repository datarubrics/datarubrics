In this work, we introduce a novel Multimodal Personality Traits Assessment (MuPTA) corpus. Our MuPTA corpus is unique in that it contains both spontaneous and read speech collected in the midly-resourced Russian language. We present a novel audio-visual approach for PTA that is used in order to set up baseline results on this corpus. We further analyze the impact of both spontaneous and read speech types on the PTA predictive performance. We find that for the audio modality, the PTA predictive performances on short signals are almost equal regardless of the speech type, while PTA using video modality is more accurate with spontaneous speech compared to read one regardless of the signal length.\\n\\nIndex Terms: audio-visual resources, data annotation, multimodal paralinguistics, personality computing, Big Five traits\\n\\n1. Introduction\\nPersonality Computing (PC) is a multi-disciplinary field that combines both psychology and computer science to analyze human personality traits using various computational methods. Personality traits are believed to be relatively stable over time, and they are a key factor in shaping such human's individual patterns as thoughts, feelings, and behaviors [1]. Big Five model describes these patterns and comprises five personality traits, namely, Openness to experience (OPE), Conscientiousness (CON), Extraversion (EXT), Agreeableness (AGR), Neuroticism/Non-Neuroticism (NEU/NNEU).\\n\\nThe importance of PC lies in its strong relation to high-risk tasks such as job interview recommendation [2, 3], conversational interfaces [4] and mood disorders. Multiple studies in medical and social sciences, including [5, 6], have reviewed the association of personality traits with mood disorders, such as major depressive disorder. This meta-analysis indicated a strong connection between some mental illnesses and personality, of which all disorders had a configuration of low CON and high NEU values.\\n\\nTo date, all collected corpora for personality traits assessment (PTA) have exclusively included spontaneous speech only. While spontaneous speech can reveal an emotional tone and cognitive style through the analysis of word frequency and speech patterns [7], read speech can also provide valuable information on human's personality traits via non-verbal information. For example, the same phrase can be pronounced in a various way by different human beings with varying speech prosody [8]. Additionally, both types of speech can exert changes in human facial expressions and behavior.\\n\\nIn this paper, we consider PTA using read speech for the first time. We also compare which type of speech allows better assessment of the human personality. For that, we collected a novel Multimodal Personality Traits Assessment (MuPTA) corpus that contains both spontaneous and read speech.\\n\\n2. Related work\\n2.1. Existing multimodal corpora\\nAutomatic PTA can be performed by three communication modalities: audio (prosodic, energy-based and spectral features, voice quality, etc.) [9], visual (facial expressions, scene, aesthetic preference, etc.) [10, 11], and text (sentiment word and its meaning, etc.) [12]. A brief description and comparison of several existing multimodal corpora is presented in Table 1.\\n\\nA review of multimodal corpora for PTA shows that: (1) most of the existing corpora are in English; (2) all the corpora were collected \\\"in-the-Wild\\\" or in office conditions; (3) corpora contain spontaneous speech on a fixed topic; (4) the personality traits annotation is made according to the results of self-evaluation, familiar- or third-party-evaluation; (5) there is an uneven gender distribution; (6) most of the speakers are young people under 30 y.o.\\n\\nThus, our MuPTA corpus differs from others in that it contains audio-visual recordings from 30 native Russian speakers with a uniform distribution per gender and age, and also includes both spontaneous and read speech.\\n\\n2.2. State-of-the-art approaches\\nSeveral competitions focused on developing approaches for multimodal PTA were organized in prominent international conferences, including INTERSPEECH 2012 [21], CVPR 2017 [22], and ICCV 2021 [23]. Two corpora, namely FI v2 (ChaLearn First Impressions V2) [3] and UDIV A [18], were presented and used in the respective competitions, where competitors using a common protocol developed and tested their approaches. Regardless of the corpus used, there are several trends that have shown positive effects on the performance of the proposed approach. In this study, we develop a baseline approach using video (face) and audio modalities. Therefore, state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches are only considered for these two modalities.\\n\\nAudio modality. The use of log-Mel spectrograms [24, 25] to extract speech features from a signal prevails over other features such as hand-crafted features (e.g., openSMILE) [2, 26, 27], and raw audio signals [28]. Log-Mel spectrograms are used coupled with 2D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) [24, 25], Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTM) [25] or Fully Connected Neural Networks (FCNN) [24].\"}"}

Raw face images [2, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28] are mainly used as features, which significantly dominate over expert features such as image histograms [22], Local Gabor Binary Patterns [2], etc. The raw face images are used as input data for the 2D/3D/(2+1)D CNNs with the addition of spatial-temporal models (such as LSTM [25, 27] and Transformer [26]), Extreme Learning Machines (ELM) [2] and FCNN [28, 24].\\n\\nIt is challenging to determine best-performing unimodal deep models for audio and video modalities because most papers present results after combining audio, video (face and scene), and text modalities.

Data collection\\nThe MuPTA corpus contains data of 30 native Russian speakers. A comparison of the MuPTA corpus with existing multimodal corpora for PTA is presented in Table 1. The corpus was recorded using three devices: two Apple iPhone XS Max smartphones and one Apple iPad Pro tablet. The audio data were collected with a sampling frequency of 48 kHz, 16 bits per sample, mono format. We use the following video parameters: 4K resolution (3840\u00d72160 pixels), frames per second (FPS) is 60 (for smartphones) and 30 (for tablet), the color coding is 24 bits per pixel. The recording setup was similar to the study [29] and sample video frames are shown in Figure 1. Each speaker completed three various tasks: (1) briefly introduced him/herself; (2) described what is happening in two complicated pictures; (3) read some scripted sentences out loudly (a list of 40 sentences was prepared for reading). The phonetically balanced text presented in [30] was used to select utterances for reading. This text was carefully curated to investigate the speech patterns and variations of native Russian speakers with distinctive phonetic features. It allows developing a complete speech profile of the speaker. The text also contains dialogs with interrogative, exclamatory and affirmative sentences, that allow highlighting differences in personality traits. The number of words in sentences ranges from 1 to 22, the average number of words is 8 with a standard deviation (std) of 5. In total, 43 utterances were recorded from each speaker: 3 spontaneous (tasks 1 and 2, the latter having two sub-tasks) and 40 scripted sentences (task 3). Note that PTA by read speech was not studied before.\\n\\nFigure 2 shows the duration distribution of the recorded phrases. The duration of spontaneous speech is at least 4 sec. The duration of read speech varies from 0.4 to 11.5 sec, 2.5 sec in average. In total, MuPTA consists of 4.1 hours of spontaneous speech and 3.3 hours of read one.\\n\\nThe data of each informant were recorded continuously by all three devices, so we have split the recorded files into phrases. Firstly, we annotated the start and end points of speech activity using Adobe Audition. We then synchronized the recordings of all three devices using Adobe Premier Pro. Finally, we have split all the recordings using obtained speech timestamps and shifts for each channel.\\n\\n3.2. Data annotation\\nEach speaker (informant) have filled in a self-evaluation questionnaire of 60 questions [31]. This is a standard questionnaire...\"}"}

Proposed approach\\n\\nThe pipeline of the proposed audio-visual approach for PTA using a mid-level feature fusion is shown in Figure 3. The approach integrates audio and video subsystems. The Video system receives downsampled frames (5 FPS) as an input. Mid-level NN-based features for both systems are extracted from 2 sec segments with 1 sec steps. For each set of mid-level NN-based features, we calculate both mean and std values, concatenate and pass them into a FCNN in order to estimate personality traits scores for the whole clip. In [18, 33], chunking was done with 1.5 and 2.5 sec segments for the PTA task. We chose a segment length of 2 sec, because the most utterances of read speech are between 2 and 2.5 sec.\\n\\nWe trained all the models using the Adam optimizer for 100 epochs and the Cosine Annealing Learning Schedule [34] with 5-rate restart cycles. Such hyper-parameters as the number of layers and units in them, a dropout probability, and a learning rate are selected experimentally by grid search.\\n\\nOur approach differs from other SOTA approaches in that we: (1) downsample frames and segment the clips; (2) fine-tune two models to extract mid-level features at the segment-level; (3) use feature-level fusion at the clip-level to calculate the predictions. This strategy reduces the number of model parameters, making our approach suitable for real-time applications.\\n\\n4.1. Audio system\\n\\nThe log-Mel spectrograms with 128 Mel filter banks were extracted by the open-source library Librosa [35] from each audio file. The size of the feature matrix for a 2-sec audio segment is $128 \\\\times 173$. The features are padded with mean values in the case an audio segment is shorter than 2 sec. The extracted features were converted into images, resized to $224 \\\\times 224$ pixels and repeated three times. So, we use input vectors of $224 \\\\times 224 \\\\times 3$, which are then normalized to the range $[0, 1]$.\\n\\nWe apply the pre-trained VGG-16 model [36] for extracting deep features from log-Mel spectrograms. This model has been successfully used in the PTA task [24, 25]. FCNN is used for the final regression task; it consists of three fully connected layers (FCL) with 512, 256, and 5 neurons, as well as a linear activation function for the last layer. In the training process, the learning rate ranged from $5e^{-5}$ to $5e^{-6}$.\\n\\n4.2. Video system\\n\\nWe apply the Face Mesh model [37] from the MediaPipe library for detecting facial regions and 468 3D facial landmarks. We chose this model because of the richness of facial landmarks. Also, since the frame rates of the videos are different, each video file is downsampled to 5 FPS to keep the same processing conditions for LSTM networks. For a 2-sec video segment, the number of frames is 10. The last frame is repeated as many times as necessary if the video segment is shorter than 2 sec.\\n\\nIt is known that personality traits are determined by the sequence of emotional and behavioral reactions of different people to the same stimuli [38]. Inspired by this fact and the research [39], we apply the open-source Emo-AffectNet model [40] for extracting 512 deep emotional facial features. This model's performance is confirmed in the emotion recognition task recently [40]. The size of the feature matrix for a 2-sec video segment is $10 \\\\times 512$.\\n\\nA single-hidden-layer LSTM model is used to extract mid-level features from the videos. This model comprises one LSTM layer with 1024 units and one FCL with 5 neurons with a linear activation function. We trained this model with a learning rate ranging from $5e^{-3}$ to $5e^{-4}$.\\n\\n4.3. Audio-visual system\\n\\nThe duration of audio-visual clips differs in the MuPTA corpus. For example, if the duration of a clip is 15 sec, it amounts to 16 (overlapping) segments. Hence we get $16 \\\\times F$ feature matrices, where $F$ is the number of features extracted from each segment.\"}"}

Experimental results and discussion\\n\\nWe evaluated the proposed approach for PTA using standard performance measures: Accuracy (ACC), which is calculated as $1 - \\\\text{Mean Absolute Error (MAE)}$ as in [3], and Concordance Correlation Coefficient (CCC). While ACC reflects the error between predicted and ground truth scores, CCC indicates a correlation between them. CCC is more robust compared to the Pearson's Correlation Coefficient (PCC), as it also considers the difference in means [41]:\\n\\n$$\\\\text{CCC} = \\\\frac{2 \\\\cdot \\\\sigma_{t,p}}{\\\\sigma^2_t + \\\\sigma^2_p + (\\\\mu_t - \\\\mu_p)^2},$$\\n\\nwhere $\\\\mu_t$ and $\\\\mu_p$ denote the averaged ground truth and predicted scores for all test clips, respectively; $\\\\sigma_t$ and $\\\\sigma_p$ \u2013 the respective standard deviations; $\\\\sigma_{t,p}$ \u2013 the covariance between $t$ and $p$.\\n\\nTable 3: Comparison of the CCC of systems in the case of spontaneous (SP) and read (RE) speech type (ST), as well as segment duration (seconds).\\n\\n|      | 2 | 5 | 10 | 20 | 30 | 50 | Whole |\\n|------|---|---|----|----|----|----|-------|\\n| A SP | .575 | .578 | .575 | .575 | .574 | .574 | .574 |\\n| V SP | .518 | .529 | .530 | .539 | .538 | .537 | .536 |\\n| A V SP | .601 | .618 | .619 | .632 | .631 | .628 | .628 |\\n\\nThe results obtained on the MuPTA corpus are presented in Table 2, which indicates that in the Development set, AGR trait is the most difficult to predict, whereas in the Test set, EXT and NNEU are the least performing dimensions. This is because the distribution of ground truth scores for these traits in the Development and Test sets differs from that in the Train set. The ACC measure shows that the visual system outperforms the audio system. However, according to the CCC measure, the audio predicted scores are more reliable than the visual ones. Combining both systems leads to an absolute increase of 2.2% in CCC value (.650 vs. .672) for the Development set and 4.4% (.574 vs. .614) for the Test set. It demonstrates that PTA is more reliable when the audio and video systems are fused.\\n\\nThe performance measures for spontaneous and read speech at various segment durations are compared in Table 3. To present the measures, we cut the clips to \\\\{2-50\\\\} sec, or use the whole clip. There are no read utterances longer than 10 sec in MuPTA. The audio system shows almost no difference in performance between two speech types at short signals (2 sec). Unlike the audio system, the visual one shows better CCC performance with spontaneous speech compared to read speech regardless of the signal length. The best CCC performance is achieved with a signal length of 20 sec. Despite the fact that the audio system outperforms the visual one at all signal durations, the audio-visual system shows a bias towards the video modality and displays a similar performance pattern.\\n\\nThus, we can draw the following conclusions: (1) read speech is informative in the case of audio system, unlike spontaneous speech, that is more informative for video and multi-modal systems; (2) the optimal signal length for multimodal PTA is 20 sec, in which case the audio system works well; the video and multimodal systems reach their best performances.\\n\\nIt should be noted that our proposed approach works in real-time. Processing a 15.3 sec clip on a CPU (using Intel i9) takes 9.1 sec with a frame resolution of 3840 \u00d7 2160, of which 7.9 sec are needed to process video data. With a change in frame resolution to 1280 \u00d7 720, the processing time reduces to 3.8 sec.\\n\\n6. Conclusions\\n\\nIn this paper, we presented the Multimodal Personality Traits Assessment (MuPTA) corpus, which is the first corpus that contains both spontaneous and read audio-visual speech. In addition, we propose a real-time multimodal approach for personality computing, by which we compared which type of speech allows better assessment of the human's personality traits. As a result, we find that audio modality outperforms video modality in terms of performance, while multimodal fusion gives the best performance. In addition, the optimal signal length for video and multimodal systems is observed to be 20 sec, while for audio it is shorter (5 sec). Lastly, for video and multimodal systems, spontaneous speech is found to suit the PTA task better, while both speech types of a short length are almost equally performing for the audio modality. Both the source code of our approach and the MuPTA corpus can be found at the web-page [1].\\n\\nIn the future, we plan to improve our approach by incorporating modalities like text, video (scene), and metadata. Moreover, we plan to conduct a large scale cross-corpus and multilingual research on personality traits assessment.\\n\\n7.
