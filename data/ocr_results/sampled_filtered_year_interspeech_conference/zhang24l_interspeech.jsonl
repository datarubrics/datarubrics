It included 173 participants from 27 healthy individuals and 146 voice disorders, whose various types and severities of vocal impairments as diagnosed by speech pathology experts via auditory perceptual evaluations and laryngoscopic imagery. DysArinVox is designed to provide a high-quality Chinese resource for AI-driven diagnostics and prognostics. To ensure the efficiency of corpus collection, we meticulously crafted recording scripts represent Mandarin phonetically, ensuring comprehensive syllable representation with minimal lexical complexity. Additionally, incorporating laryngoscopic images of patients into the dataset offers extra visual information, facilitating the development of advanced diagnostic frameworks. To our knowledge, this database represents the most comprehensive corpus of Chinese pathological speech to date.\\n\\nIndex Terms: Pathological speech corpus, mandarin, automatic diagnostics\\n\\n1. Introduction\\n\\nPathological speech disorders impact approximately 30% of the global population [1]. As speech often remains the most effective method of interaction with the external world, speech health issues have garnered worldwide attention. Traditional diagnostic approaches combine objective (acoustic and physiological) and subjective (perceptual) evaluations, heavily dependent on the expertise of speech-language pathologists [2, 3, 4], rendering them resource-intensive. Further diagnosis of conditions requires reliance on invasive methods, such as video laryngoscopy [5], to present the muscular and structural conditions of the disorder. In recent years, with the widespread application of imaging and video technology, AI-driven clinical diagnostics and prognosis have made significant advances [6]. The effectiveness of these diagnostic techniques depends on professional medical equipment to collect precise medical images, limiting accessibility for regular users.\\n\\nSpeech signal-based pathological characterizations introduce a new paradigm for easier remote diagnostic and health monitoring, requiring AI models to create stronger correlations between speech features and actual pathologies [7]. However, current pathological speech corpus do not fully meet the requirements for developing diagnostic models in terms of data volume, condition diversity, corpus richness, or accuracy of disorder annotations. In this work, we have developed a speech database containing recordings from both healthy individuals and those with speech disorders. This corpus aims to offer new resources for advancing AI-driven diagnostic technologies in the future.\\n\\nWhile constructing the DysArinVox corpus, we applied a series of carefully planned strategies to ensure its effectiveness for researching and applying Mandarin pathological speech. Initially, acknowledging the challenges faced by patients with pathological speech in long recording sessions, we leveraged insights from English databases to develop recording texts tailored for Mandarin pronunciation. The collection aims to cover all Mandarin phonemes using minimal text, emphasizing vowels, phrases, short to long sentences, and classical poetry. The design accounts for complete phoneme representation and the variation in pathological speech patterns between contemporary and traditional Chinese rhythms.\\n\\nConcerning the disease types included in the corpus, we encompassed prevalent pathological speech conditions [8] such as dysphonia and dysarthria. Disease diagnostics were detailed into 20 distinct disorder categories, including paralysis, leukoplakia, and polyps, to enhance the precision of disease classification.\\n\\nFor labeling, we performed thorough evaluations of the pathological speech collected, encompassing subjective perceptual assessments (MOS and GRBAS [9]) and laryngoscopic examinations. Through these evaluation methods, we quantified the severity of speech disorders from an auditory perception perspective and marked 11 detailed indices for the pathological state of the vocal cords (such as size, location, tumor morphology, and mucosal waves), ensuring the corpus contains both comprehensive and detailed information.\\n\\nThe DysArinVox corpus includes 173 participants (146 with voice disorders and 27 healthy) and features an average of 324 words per participant, covering vowels, phrases, sentences, and Chinese classical poetry. It presents a valuable asset for researching Mandarin pathological speech. This corpus not only provides a rich and comprehensive set of speech samples but also detailed pathological labels and evaluation metrics, greatly enhancing our understanding of the physical basis of speech disorders. Additionally, it provides important reference information and data support for the diagnosis, treatment, and scientific study of pathological speech.\\n\\nThe rest of this paper examines existing databases, the textual structure of the DysArinVox database, and provides an analysis and discussion on the labeling of the collected data.\\n\\n2.

Over the years, these databases have found widespread application and laid crucial groundwork for the investigation of pathological speech [14], as well as for advancements in automatic speech recognition and speech synthesis. However, the limited diversity of disorders and the precision of existing datasets do not suffice for the development of diagnostic models. Table 1 compares DysArinVox with four existing pathological databases.\\n\\nRegarding scripts richness, the MEEI transcript consists of only the vowel /a/ and the first part of the \\\"rainbow passage\\\", and the SVD transcript includes the vowels /a/, /i/, /u/ in normal, high, low and rising-falling pitch, along with one sentence in German: \\\"Guten Morgen, wie geht es Ihnen\\\". These prominent dysphonia databases primarily emphasize vowels and lack comprehensive continuous speech data. While vowels are sufficient for tasks like dysphonia detection, true speech expressions encompass a wider array of vocal elements, including consonants, phoneme variations, and coarticulation, essential for pathological speech research. Dysarthria datasets, such as UASPEECH, are designed to assess word articulation intelligibility, featuring 300 unique, less common English words and three repetitions of 155 words. Limited by its reliance on scripts of isolated words, UASPEECH's speech data lacks the phonetic variability, connectivity, and rhythm found in continuous speech\u2014crucial for daily communication. TORGO faces similar challenges. Although its recording scripts are rich in content, including non-words, short words, restricted sentences and unrestricted sentences in English, the selection of its restricted content (the first three categories) is primarily based on the demand for intelligibility assessment of speech. As a result, TORGO has also failed to adequately address the coverage of commonly used phonemes and the emphasis on rhythmic variations, which are crucial in the emerging study of pathological speech. Moreover, the diversity of diseases and the quantity of patients in these two dysarthria datasets are insufficient, limiting their use primarily to the development of automatic speech recognition (ASR) tasks.\\n\\nIn the terms of labels, many datasets show a lack of precision and diversity. For instance, while the MEEI dataset includes diagnostic labels for patients, not all patients are accurately recorded and diagnosed, with some being recorded multiple times [15]. The MEEI and SVD datasets both lack subjective or objective evaluation labels for their recordings, essential for assessing speech conditions and diagnosing diseases. TORGO, in response of existing dysarthria datasets, does not declare the detailed age label of the speaker, which hinders the analysis of age-related effects on pathological speech.\\n\\nAs for data collection, the sampling rates and recording environments of the normal and pathological data in MEEI are not standardized, which may lead automatic detection systems to focus more on irrelevant features such as recording environment of audio files, potentially adversely affecting subsequent evaluation and research. There is a significant imbalance between pathological and normal data in MEEI, with proportions at 93% and 7%, respectively. The huge bias in the amount of data may lead to bias in the pathology voice detection systems developed on it, which may not provide reliable results [15].\\n\\nIn terms of the diversity of diseases, UASPEECH collects pathological speech from only three types of cerebral palsy speakers, while TORGO has only one patient with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, with the other pathological data coming from patients with cerebral palsy. As for the number of subjects, datasets like TORGO and UASPEECH captured relatively few pathological speakers. This may make automatic detection systems more prone to recognizing speaker characteristics rather than the speech quality, thus losing the practical significance of detecting and evaluating pathological speech from unseen speakers. Additionally, all of the datasets mentioned above are short of supplemental endoscopic image data, despite the importance of which in pathological speech research, as indicated by related studies [16].\\n\\n3. The construction of DysArinVox\\n\\n3.1. The design of recording scripts\\n\\nBased on the linguistic structure and phonetic characteristics of Chinese, while ensuring the coverage of all phonemes in Mandarin with limited text and highlighting commonly used phonemes, we propose the recording scripts for DysArinVox. During the design of the scripts, we have also taken into account the characteristics of Chinese pronunciation in both dysphonia and dysarthria pathological speech, as well as the differences in phonology between Modern and Ancient Chinese. The recording scripts include vowels, phrases, short sentences, paragraphs and classical poetry, covering all initials and finals of Chinese Pinyin, as well as rhythm and coarticulation variations in the contexts of short sentences, paragraphs and classical poetry. The breakdown of the recording scripts content and their respective counts and functions are summarized in Table 2.\"}"}

In this part, we specifically consider the situation of homophones in Chinese and the four most frequently used vowels (/i/, /e/, /a/, /ai/). In the third part, three colloquial sentences of varying lengths, totaling 41 words, are designed firstly to provide as broad coverage as possible of the initials and finals in Mandarin. Secondly, a passage of 139 characters is used to cover all initials and finals in Mandarin, aiming to record the patient's status when reading paragraphs and long sentences. Specifically, to cover the special case in Mandarin where one pinyin contains two finals, for example, the pronunciation /qian/ contains two finals /i/ and /an/, we treat the coarticulation of the two finals as a new final and cover it in the recording scripts. Through the meticulous design of the phrases and paragraph parts, we are able to emphasize the coverage of commonly used phonemes in Chinese.\\n\\nThe fourth part, adhering to the special rhythm requirements of Chinese poetry, incorporates three classical poems to capture the rhythmic patterns during patient pronunciation. Regarding the selection of the classical poetry, considering that some older subjects may be illiterate or have poor eyesight, we followed the design approach of the AVPD [18], choosing three very simple and widely circulated classical poems that are highly likely to be read even by those who do not recognize characters. To supplement the uncertainty of the data and enhance the coverage of Chinese phonemes, we design some colloquial sentences for comprehensive supplement as the fifth part, randomly selecting portions for subjects to read and record.\\n\\nTone, as an important part of Chinese Pinyin, divided into four categories: Yinping, Yangping, Shangsheng and Qusheng. The first two are referred to as level tone, while last two are referred to as oblique tone. And there is a special tone sandhi called light tone. In the design of the recording scripts, considering the influence of different tones on pronunciation for the same vowel, we covered the above five tones in high-frequency vowels separately.\\n\\nFigure 1: MOS distribution for the most numerous diseases\\n\\n3.2. The diversity of disorders\\n\\nWe have identified and annotated a total of 20 specific disorders while the processing of data. In the collected pathologies, dysarthria is present in three disorders: spasmodic disorder, motor dysarthria and functional dysarthria, with the rest of the data all associating with dysphonia. All 20 diseases and their respective speaker counts are shown in Table 3. The distribution of MOS scores for the five most numerous diseases in DysArinVox, vocal cord paralysis (PLS), leukoplakia (LK), polyp (PLP), nodule (NDL) and Reinke's edema (RE), is shown in Figure 1. It can be observed that among these five disorders, MOS scores are all 3 or above, with the highest number of instances scoring 4. The most common pathology among the collected data is vocal fold polyp.\\n\\n3.3. Labels in DysArinVox\\n\\nConcerning the shorts in labels of existing datasets mentioned in Section 2, DysArinVox annotates collected data with subjective (MOS and GRBAS scores) and objective (11 indices derived from laryngoscopic observations) evaluation labels, in addition to commonly used labels such as health status, age and gender in pathological speech datasets. The rest of the labels include diagnoses of 20 clinical diseases and the duration of symptoms. The GRBAS and MOS scores provided by professional doctors in DysArinVox offer evaluations of roughness, breathiness, ashenia, strain, and overall grade in two subjective dimensions. As for the objective evaluation of the pathological speaker, the 11 indices from laryngoscopic examinations and their meanings are illustrated by examples in Table 4.\\n\\nIn the table, \\\"0\\\" denotes normal without any lesion. L/R indicates the side of the vocal fold affected by the lesion, with \\\"L\\\" and \\\"R\\\" representing the left and right vocal fold respectively. Loc denotes the position of the lesion on the vocal fold, divided into front (F), middle (M), and back (B) sections, with \\\"F-M\\\" indicating the boundary between the front and middle sections. Morph describes the morphology of the lesion, which includes spherical, oval and flat. LD and TD respectively represent the lesion diameter and thickness, respectively.\"}"}

In GRBAS, Roughness is utilized to assess the irregularity vibrations or the degree of vocal fold smoothness, which is often associated with the presence of lesions. Therefore, it is primarily influenced by the comprehensive effects of the preceding nine indices. According to clinical experience, lesions located in the front-middle part (the front two-thirds) have the greatest impact on speech. The last two indices concerning glottal closure have the greatest impact on Breathiness, as in the case of two speakers A and B with identical MOS scores but differing degrees of GC, rated as mild and moderate, respectively. Consequently, speaker B would receive a higher Breathiness score. Regarding Asthenia and Strain, they are primarily associated with functional disorders and relate to the coordination of the subjects' muscles. However, there are exceptions, such as speaker D, a patient with vocal fold paralysis. Despite having eight normal indices, paralysis impedes vocal fold vibration and closure, which also adversely affects all GRBAS items, especially the Breathiness.\\n\\n3.4. Data collection\\n\\nIn order to build a voice database that meets international standards and ensures high-quality recordings, DysArinVox recordings are made in a professional studio where background noise is kept below 30 dB. The recording equipment includes the KAY CSL 4500 system, 2671 preamplifier, ESI Juliet sound card, and a silent computer. All speech data are formatted at 44.1 kHz, 16-bit. A windshield was placed between the mouth and the microphone to prevent noise caused by the direct impact of the airflow on the microphone. During pronunciation, the mouth is approximately 10 cm away from the microphone. Before recording, subjects were asked to practice sustaining the long vowel /a:/ with a natural pitch and intensity, until the sound produced closely resembles their natural speaking voice, and then the recording started. Especially, DysArinVox provides the images of subjects' laryngoscopy, examples of these images for the four diseases in Table 4 are shown in Figure 2.\\n\\nThe data collection for the initial phase of DysArinVox took place from October 2022 to February 2024, spanning a duration of one year and five months. Due to time constraints, we are unable to process all the data collected. Therefore, based on the statistical analysis, we select the data of 78 individuals to be processed as the first part of initial phase, including 56 pathological speakers and 22 normal speakers. The remaining data will be released progressively after processing.\\n\\n4. Conclusion\\n\\nDysArinVox, featuring detailed annotations, precise data collection and processing, and carefully crafted recording scripts aligned with Chinese linguistic and phonetic traits, has established a robust Chinese corpus for the evolving field of pathological speech research. The initial data collection phase for DysArinVox, though mainly focused on voice disorders, included data on three types of articulatory diseases. This underscores the corpus's potential for future expansion. The second phase of data collection will focus on augmenting data related to articulatory disorders, thus making the corpus more comprehensive and inclusive. All collected and processed data will be promptly made available to researchers, supporting advances in pathological speech research and applications.\\n\\nThe DysArinVox database is a key resource for developing AI-driven diagnostic models, characterized by a wide range of diseases, extensive speech content, detailed labels, and a significant patient cohort. It incorporates both subjective and objective evaluation labels and includes laryngoscopic images to visually depict the larynx's condition. These images, as multimodal data, offer essential multidimensional information for developing new diagnostic frameworks. Moreover, the collection of Mandarin speech data in the corpus contributes valuable material to multilingual pathological speech research, which is significant for understanding the manifestation of speech disorders across different linguistic backgrounds.\\n\\n5.
