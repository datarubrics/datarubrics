A CI is installed in the internal ear, allowing participants to hear through bone conduction. A CI\u2019s primary goal is to help the person hear the sounds of speech and learn to understand speech and communicate. In order to investigate speech production development, a longitudinal study was conducted by examining early phonetic inventories of children with CI at 6 months post-implantation (PI), 1 year post-PI, 2 years post-PI, 3 years post-PI, 4 years post-PI, and 5 years post-PI.\\n\\nThe Korean phoneme system is composed of 7 monophthongs, 10 diphthongs, 18 word-final consonants, and 14 word-initial consonants. For example, Korean words ending in /\u0251/ are /h\u0251m/, /\u0251m/, and /\u0251m/. The Korean phoneme system is shown below: \u00b7 Monophthongs: i, \u025b, \u028c, \u0251, o, u, \u026f \u00b7 Diphthongs: \u025bi, \u028ci, \u0251i, oi, ui, \u026fi, a\u026f, o\u026f, u\u026f, i\u026f \u00b7 Word-initial consonants: p, t, k, b, d, g, m, n, l, r, s, \u027e \u00b7 Word-final consonants: p, t, k, b, d, g, m, n, \u027e, s\\n\\nConsonants \\n\\nVowels \\n\\nKorean vowels and consonants in IPA are as below: \u00b7 Monophthongs: i, \u025b, \u028c, \u0251, o, u, \u026f \u00b7 Diphthongs: \u025bi, \u028ci, \u0251i, oi, ui, \u026fi, a\u026f, o\u026f, u\u026f, i\u026f \u00b7 Word-initial consonants: p, t, k, b, d, g, m, n, l, r, s, \u027e \u00b7 Word-final consonants: p, t, k, b, d, g, m, n, \u027e, s\\n\\nIn order to investigate speech production development, a longitudinal study was conducted by examining early phonetic inventories of children with CI at 6 months post-implantation (PI), 1 year post-PI, 2 years post-PI, 3 years post-PI, 4 years post-PI, and 5 years post-PI. The number of phones produced by children with CI was compared with that of normal hearing (NH) children at the same chronological age. The results show that speech and language skills develop through the process of learning to hear with CI. With the advantage of improved speech perception, followed by better hearing through a CI, there is a period of developmental appropriateness in speech production, during which many children are observed to produce speech that is not the same as NH children at the same chronological age. In particular, in the analysis of children with CI, it was found that the development of speech and language skills takes time. The number of phonetic errors, including idiosyncratic phonological errors, decreases with age. The study shows that people who receive CIs at a young age continue to increase in speech and language skills over 5 years.\\n\\nAs a phonetic inventory reveals both similarities and differences in the inventories from 6 months to 5 years post-implantation, the phonetic inventory of children with CI generally analyzes speech and language skills. The phonetic inventory of children with CI includes speech production in spontaneous and imitation. The speech corpus analysis reveals that the phonetic inventories of children with CI are examined over 5 years. It can be concluded that the phonetic inventory of children with CI is a valuable tool for clinicians to examine the development of speech and language skills over 5 years.

Though [p, b] and [m, b] were included in the initial consonant inventory, using the same speech used for the imitation, the children's percentage was complete at 4;0. The fact that the consonant inventories are comparable to the consonant inventories from previous studies on children with CI because it provided the phonetic inventor, the phonetic inventory is composed of the largest range of children.\\n\\nThe inventory of children implanted before 1 year old children included many phonemes in front of the vowel [i].
