By examining 24 linguistic features of Bern and Zurich German, including nine vowels and 15 consonants in single-word utterances, we aim to fill a research gap that has been previously overlooked, despite suggestions of importance. In an online perception study, we gathered evaluations from three distinct groups of raters (N = 46) from Bern, Zurich, and Hessen, Germany, across six categories from aesthetic dimensions to stereotypical dialect attributions. The findings reveal that rater origin determines the levels of importance on evaluation categories and that certain linguistic features can be identified that are closely linked with specific perceptions (e.g., stupid or arrogant), which may foster negative biases against dialect speakers.\\n\\nIndex Terms: perceptual phonetics, perceptual dialectology, phonaesthetics, Swiss German, social bias\\n\\n1. Introduction\\nIn German-speaking Switzerland, print and digital media frequently release rankings from public surveys, evaluating the public's preference of dialects such as Bernese German, Zurich German, and Valais German. Bern and Zurich have emerged as the most ethno-dialectologically salient spaces in German-speaking Switzerland in perceptual dialectological studies [cf. 1, 2]. In public media, Bern is consistently portrayed as the \u201cmost beautiful\u201d dialect and audience favorite, while Zurich typically occupies a position around the middle or lower places of such rankings. These rankings of accent labels have demonstrated consistent patterns over time, reflecting both aesthetic perceptions as well as stereotypical associations linked to these dialects, including connotations of beauty, attractiveness, and rurality for Bern German, and such of intelligence, hardness, and modernity for Zurich German. These associations have also been confirmed in ethnographic as well as dialectological studies and show stability over a period of more than thirty years [cf. 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8].\\n\\nIn terms of potential reasons for this ranking, [4] hypothesizes the association of the regions with relaxing and good times, with listeners projecting their good-time memories onto the language of the region and calls them \u201choliday dialects\u201d consequently. Findings of a study on attributions of Swiss German dialects also found that concepts from other realms of experience are metaphorically transferred and projected onto the domain of dialect [cf. 7]. Other scholars claim that one of the main reasons why Bern German is perceived as beautiful is a kind of self-fulfilling prophecy: Bern German is considered beautiful because everyone wants it to be beautiful and particularly suitable for dialect culture due the city's important role as a political and cultural center [cf. 5, 8]. As evident in their interpretations, these studies align with the principles outlined in the Social Connotations Hypothesis [cf. 9]. On the other hand, there's the Inherent Value Hypothesis [cf. 10]. For example, [6], applying a sort of bubble-task from Gestalt psychology, interprets that these kinds of associations reflect stereotypical associations of iconic physical forms (e.g. sharp or round) with specific languages and cultures. Other studies on affective meanings of single sounds also indicate that phonaesthetic evaluations of short vowels, voiceless consonants, and hissing fricatives tend to be universally more negative compared to their phonological oppositions [cf. 11, 12].\\n\\nRecent phonaesthetic studies on a variety of languages indicate that evaluations may be influenced by purely linguistic factors such as sonority, syllable structure, and consonant clusters. Typically, CV-syllables are perceived as more aesthetically pleasing compared to those containing large consonant clusters [cf. 13, 14].\\n\\n[1, 8] emphasize the ingroup-outgroup effect on the evaluation of Swiss German dialects, with [8] highlighting the impact of /r/ quality on listener judgments. They suggest that dialect attractiveness links to perceived social characteristics and specific phonetic elements, merging Social Connotations and Inherent Value Hypotheses. Similarly, [15] found implicit social meaning in Berlin German phonetic variants, while [16] showed linguistic and social factors, including linguistic distance, affecting evaluations of 23 lesser-known languages. In our present work, we too suspect evaluation of dialectal features to be explained by a mix of social connotations and inherent aesthetics of single features.\\n\\nThe questions this paper addresses are: How are phonetic features of Bern and Zurich German dialects assessed in terms of aesthetics? In this assessment, we further investigate the roles of the region of origin of the raters, evaluation categories (universal aesthetic evaluation dimensions and ethnologically relevant dialect attributions), linguistic categories (vowels vs. consonants), and phonetic variants of single regional features. We hypothesize that aesthetic evaluations of dialectal features are influenced by learned sociocultural factors, listeners' extralinguistic characteristics, and specific phonetic features exhibiting particularly strong associations with certain categories.\\n\\nAdditionally, we anticipate that the mapping of sound features to subjective dialect attributes will primarily apply to the Swiss German listener groups, rather than the German control group.\\n\\nWe thus aim to address a research gap in perceptual dialectology concerning the practical significance of regional speech in everyday life within German-speaking Switzerland, by emphasizing the role of regional phonetic features in language...\"}"}

Methods and materials\\n\\n#### 2.1. Materials\\n\\nThe study investigates segmental phonetic features of Bern and Zurich German, including nine vowels and fifteen consonants, primarily chosen for them being systematically different [cf. 18, 19]. Secondly, scholarly literature [cf. 1] and responses from an exploratory Google questionnaire with L1-speakers of various Swiss German dialects (N = 101) indicate that these variables subjectively represent the dialectal characteristics of each region. We thus integrated both objective and subjective linguistic criteria in the selection of variables. These variables form 48 minimal pair items, contrasting 24 Bern German and Zurich German variants. All minimal pairs were integrated in single-word utterances (e.g. \\\"Milch\\\" milk, \\\"K\u00e4se\\\" cheese, \\\"f\u00fcnf\\\" five, \\\"Hund\\\" dog, etc.). As the lexical content of stimuli can be socially relevant [cf. 20], we controlled all stimuli for semantic affectivity [21].\\n\\n### Table 1: vowels investigated\\n\\n| phenomenon   | hist. variable | variants | stimuli |\\n|--------------|---------------|----------|---------|\\n| a-backing    | mhg.

Participants\\n\\n46 individuals took part, including 32 women, 11 men, and three individuals who did not disclose their gender, with a mean age of 26.8 years (SD = 4.66). They were divided into three groups of raters: Bern German BE (N = 19), Zurich German ZH (N = 12), and Germans from Hessen DE (N = 15), unfamiliar with both Swiss German dialects. Criteria for participant selection included age, their own dialect, and whether their parents spoke the same dialect as them. All participants were assessed for attitudes toward their own dialect and those of others via Likert-scale-based (1 lowest to 7 highest) levels of agreement.\\n\\n#### 2.3. Procedure\\n\\nWe initially recorded a list comprising 66 individual words with two 24-year-old female model L1-speakers of Bern and Zurich German. Subsequently, a professional actress, natively speaking the dialect of Schwyz, underwent training sessions and recorded imitations of the native speakers as part of a matched-guise design. Quality control measures were then implemented by native speakers to ensure accuracy and naturalness. The selection of relevant linguistic features was then carried out based on this comprehensive process. We assess six rating categories: three aesthetic dimensions (beautiful vs. ugly, intelligent vs. stupid, attractive vs. unattractive), taken from former studies on phonaesthetics [cf. 9, 14, 16] and dialect attributes (soft vs. hard, modern vs. old-fashioned, friendly vs. arrogant), taken from ethnological studies [cf. 1, 3, 6, 7], and the original Google questionnaire. All categories were tested for positive or negative connotations in a simple categorization task with all participants of the main study.\\n\\nWe deployed modified Implicit Association Tests (mIATs) [cf. 23], adapted from methodologies utilized in previous sociophonetic studies [cf. 15]. In an online within-subjects experiment using Gorilla Experiment Builder [cf. 24, 25], participants were to allocate each of the 48 distinct stimuli to one of two predetermined categories (e.g. via pressing button \\\"w\\\" on the keyboard for \\\"beautiful\\\" vs. button \\\"p\\\" for \\\"ugly\\\") \\\"as fast as they can\\\", resulting in 48 trials for each of the six pairs of categories. Stimuli were presented in randomized order for each category pair. Reaction times and raters\u2019 decisions were recorded. Social data such as age, gender, region of origin, and mobility were collected via questionnaire. Quality control involved examining reaction time medians and correlating rating categories across all groups.\\n\\nUsing R and Jamovi [cf. 26, 27], we analyze variances via mixed effects models (\u03b1 = 0.05) to study factors influencing the rating process, including raters\u2019 region, variant origin, vowel-consonant distinction, category relevance, and feature-category correlation. We use absolute ratings and reaction times as measures. For the mIATs, we adhere to the assumption that faster reaction times imply stronger associations [cf. 15, 28].\\n\\n### 3. Results\\n\\n#### 3.1. Raters\u2019 attitudes toward dialect\\n\\nWe found a generally positive attitude towards both own and other dialects among Swiss groups (BE: M own = 5.74, SD own = 0.93, M other = 6.21, SD other = 0.97, ZH: M own = 5.08, SD own = 1.44, M other = 6.17, SD other = 0.83).

Overall ratings and relevance of categories\\n\\nT-tests (H\u2080 \u03bc rate\u2009BE_origin \u2260 \u03bc rate\u2009ZH_origin, cf. table 3) and analyses of variances (H\u2080 \u03bc rate\u2009vow \u2260 \u03bc rate\u2009cons) revealed the significance of the variable variant origin in influencing overall positive or negative evaluations among both Swiss groups of raters (BE, ZH). Both groups significantly favored their own variants while rating others' variants more negatively, with Zurich raters showing the greater effect of both groups. No such effect is observed among German raters (DE), who nevertheless exhibit a slight preference for Zurich German variants. We thus observe a pronounced regional bias, that is, attenuated within the German test group. The variable vowel-consonant distinction did not exhibit any significant impact on overall ratings.\\n\\nSubsequently, we examined category relevance for variant origin (H\u2080 \u03bc rate\u2009BE origin \u2260 \u03bc rate\u2009ZH_origin), given its previous significant association. Responses from all raters were pooled for these analyses, see fig. 1.\\n\\nTable 3: model effects for rating categories by groups\\n\\n| depVar    | p all  | p BE   | p ZH   | p DE   |\\n|-----------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\\n| RBeautif  | 0.441  | <.001*** | 0.004** | 0.241  |\\n| RUgly     | 0.276  | <.001*** | 0.008** | 0.241  |\\n| RHard     | 0.18   | 0.116  | 0.416  | 0.877  |\\n| RSoft     | 0.149  | 0.116  | 0.379  | 0.842  |\\n| RIntellig | 0.089  | 0.202  | <.001*** | 0.101  |\\n| RStupid   | 0.007** | 0.299  | <.001*** | 0.101  |\\n| ROldfash  | 0.078  | 0.94   | <.001*** | 0.448  |\\n| RModern   | 0.038* | 0.94   | <.001*** | 0.597  |\\n| RAttract  | 0.604  | <.001*** | <.001*** | 0.147  |\\n| RUnattr   | 0.4    | <.001*** | 0.002** | 0.147  |\\n| RFriendly | 0.026* | <.001*** | 0.051  | 0.848  |\\n| RArrogant | 0.02*  | <.001*** | 0.056  | 0.616  |\\n\\nThe categories displaying a statistically significant difference in absolute ratings (R category) across all rater groups are \\\"stupid\\\", \\\"modern\\\", \\\"friendly\\\" and \\\"arrogant\\\", though obvious trends in figure 1 show, that more categories may become relevant (e.g. \\\"soft\\\", \\\"old-fashioned\\\", \\\"modern\\\"), depending on the model used. Note that the maximum possible absolute rating numbers for each pair of categories (e.g., beautiful/ugly) calculate as follows: 48 stimuli x 46 raters = 2208 (assuming a 50/50 distribution, the total would be 1104). The relevance of each category highly depends on the raters' region of origin [cf. table 3], thus again supporting the aforementioned region bias within the Swiss rater groups.\\n\\n3.3. Phonetic features linked to categories\\n\\nIn what follows, we present a set of specific phonetic features that appear to exhibit a robust association with certain categories (e.g. \\\"stupid\\\"). The empirical strategy guiding this investigation is to identify features consistently receiving high absolute ratings (>90%) and eliciting minimal reaction times (<median of this category) across a diverse range of raters when assigned to certain categories. Similar to the significance of the categories themselves (see 3.2), the association of phonetic features with these categories is highly contingent upon the specific group of raters. Due to space constraints, only a selection of the individual findings can be presented. We will focus on phonetic features associated with categories likely to engender a negative perception of their speakers, thereby potentially creating biasing against them. Comprehensive tables depicting all features mapped onto categories, while adhering to the empirical constraints outlined above including medians of absolute rates and reaction times, are available in the supplementary material accessible through the following link: https://osf.io/5qm3v.\\n\\nFigure 2 shows the distribution of BE (orange dots) and ZH (turquoise triangles) variants allocated to the category \\\"stupid\\\", as rated by ZH and DE raters, with the y-axis depicting absolute ratings. The grouping of these raters together in the plot reflects their similar patterns of rating, contrasting with the divergent patterns observed among Bern raters, thereby warranting their exclusion from the plot. The figure illustrates a higher frequency of \\\"stupid\\\" ratings for Bern variants compared to Zurich variants by both groups of raters. At least seven BE features demonstrate consistently high ratings for this category (\u00e4-opening, e-rounding, l-vocalization, \u00f6i-\u00fc contrast, primary Umlaut, s-palatalization, and nd-velarization).\\n\\nFigure 2: phonetic features rated as \\\"stupid\\\"\"}"}
