Benway, Jonathan L. Preston, Elaine Hitchcock, Asif Salekin, Harshit Sharma, Tara McAllister\\n\\nAbstract\\nWe present the PERCEPT-R corpus, a labeled corpus of child speakers of American English with typical speech and residual speech sound disorders affecting rhotics. We demonstrate the utility of age- and gender-normalized formants extracted from PERCEPT-R in training support vector classifiers to predict ground-truth perceptual judgments of \\\"rhotic\\\" (i.e., dialect-typical) and clinical \\\"derhotic\\\" /\u0279/ for novel speakers (mean of participant-specific f-metrics = .83; SD = .18, N = 281).\\n\\nIndex Terms: clinical speech, child speech, open access dataset, mispronunciation detection\\n\\n1. Introduction\\nChildren with speech sound disorder show diminished accuracy and intelligibility in spoken communication and may thus experience negative impacts on academic, socioemotional, and socioeconomic outcomes [1-3]. While most speech errors resolve by the late school-age years, between 2-5% of speakers exhibit residual speech sound disorder (RSSD) that persists until adulthood [4]. We focus on /\u0279/, the most common and challenging residual speech deviation in American English [5]. Effective intervention can reduce the lifetime burden of RSSD for impacted individuals. Motor-based intervention is one evidence-based practice for RSSD involving adaptive delivery of auditory-visual models and verbal cues for articulator placement [6]. However, not all children have access to motor-based intervention due to clinician shortages [7]. Even when intervention for RSSD is secured, treatment intensity might be lower than required for successful intervention because of clinician caseload size [8, 9]. Such access barriers could potentially be mitigated by computerized therapy with automated mispronunciation detection [10], but no existing system is sufficient for clinical use [11]. The three fundamental issues impacting available systems are the lack of examples of RSSD speech for system training, low accuracy when analyzing sounds produced incorrectly, and no empirical assessment of therapeutic benefit [11, 12].\\n\\n1.1. Motivation and Contribution\\nThe development of child speech technologies is hindered by the lack of large-scale, labeled child speech corpora [13], doubly so for child clinical speech technologies [11]. Corpora are emerging to address the need for publicly available child clinical data, such as SEED [14] and the three datasets of Ultrasuite [15]. These corpora contain spoken utterances elicited during the course of evaluation and treatment (Table 1). However, to our knowledge, no publicly available clinical corpus provides labeled training data for the audio classification of rhotic/derhotic /\u0279/ in the context of RSSD.\\n\\nTable 1: Notable public clinical speech corpora.\\n\\n| Corpus      | Tokens | Speakers | Notes |\\n|-------------|--------|----------|-------|\\n| SEED        | ~16,000 words and sentences | 58 children, 34 adults | Data from 16 speech tasks |\\n| Ultrasuite  | ~14,500 phones, words, sentences, & nonspeech | 86 children | Ultrasound treatment data |\\n| PERCEPT-R    | 105,232 words | 281 children, 1 young adult | Introduced herein |\\n\\nIn the absence of high-quality data, mispronunciation detection algorithms are not sufficient for clinical use. McKechnie and colleagues [11] systematically reviewed automatic child speech analysis tools for clinical use or second language phonetic acquisition. The studies reviewed report percent agreement with human judgment ranging from 45.7% to 95.67%; however, the authors caution that these numbers may be misleading when the test datasets contain few exemplars of mispronounced speech. As such, no available tool reviewed, including audio classifiers, met the authors' accuracy threshold for identifying incorrectly produced words (>0.8). Also, none of the studies specifically investigated rhotic classification in children. Gupta and DiPadova [16] later provide evidence that support vector machines were suitable for a related task, the classification of tokens showing typical sociophonetic variation with regards to rhoticity. This task, however, is not entirely analogous to the classification of clinical speech because of potential articulatory (i.e., acoustic) differences between dialect-typical /\u0279/ in non-rhotic dialects and the types of clinical /\u0279/ deviations observed in RSSD.\\n\\nThis paper offers two contributions. First, we present the PERCEPT-R corpus (Perceptual Error Rating for the Clinical Evaluation of Phonetic Targets-R). PERCEPT-R is an order of magnitude larger than other publicly available child clinical...\"}"}

Discussion\\n\\nThis study addresses the first barrier to the development of child clinical speech technologies: the lack of useful public data. The size of PERCEPT-R 2.2.1p compares favorably to existing publicly available corpora of children's clinical speech. The quality of corpus labels and integration with Phon allows for detailed phonological analyses to be completed on corpus items. We anticipate that these features will make the corpus a valuable resource for researchers in linguistics and communication disorders. We also anticipate that the data will be of interest to speech technology engineers interested in FAIR engineering, in addition to those interested in /\u0279/ classification.\\n\\nOur demonstration indicates that meaningful features can be extracted from PERCEPT-R for the purpose of binary classification of /\u0279/ in children with RSSD and is in line with previous classification attempts for /\u0279/.\\n\\nThe distribution of participant-specific f-metrics indicates that some voices may be a better fit for automated speech analysis than others, likely because of difficulties with formant extraction. Future development on classifiers trained on the PERCEPT-R corpus can identify speech biomarkers associated with high classification accuracy and methodologies/features/classifier architectures to increase accuracy for ill-fitting subjects.\\n\\nFigure 3. Distribution of participant-specific f-metrics.\\n\\nImportantly, our results surpass the threshold set by McKechnie and colleagues [11] for clinically useful speech technology. Further work can embed optimized versions of these classifiers into existing motor-based intervention software. The planned experimental validation of such tools will address the second and third largest barriers to the success of child clinical speech technology: insufficient technical description and lack of clinical efficacy data for these systems.\\n\\n6. Conclusion\\n\\nWe have presented the first public release of the PERCEPT-R corpus, 2.2.1p. The corpus is the first dataset to demonstrate utility for training clinically-acceptable classifiers for the prediction of /\u0279/ perceptual judgment in children with RSSDs.\\n\\n7.
