Laurel went viral: when listening to the same audio clip, some people claimed to hear only Yanny, others insisted it must be Laurel, and some had a mixed percept. Phoneticians have identified the acoustic features which caused this perceptual ambiguity, but we still know little about the factors affecting individuals\u2019 perceptual perception of the illusion. We conducted a controlled study with 974 Swiss German listeners, balanced for age, gender, and regional origin. Overall, nearly two thirds heard Yanny, one quarter Laurel, and about 1/2% had a mixed percept. We found age, gender, and electronic device to play a significant role: younger, female, and laptop-using participants demonstrated higher proportions of Yanny responses. These findings contribute to the growing body of research on polyperceivable words.\\n\\nIndex Terms: speech perception, auditory illusion, Swiss German\\n\\n1. Introduction\\nIn May of 2018, a recording of a single word caused widespread debate: we are, of course, talking about the ominous-sounding file with a percept of either Yanny or Laurel (or something else altogether). The origin of the clip makes for a good story: a high school student \u2013 Katie Hetzel \u2013 was looking for the pronunciation of the name Laurel and checked the site www.vocabulary.com. The student saved the recording and, upon replaying it, noticed that she no longer heard Laurel, but Yanny. She mentioned this to a friend who uploaded it on social media and it went viral from there (the original recording can be found here: https://twitter.com/CloeCouture/status/996218489831473152).\\n\\nListeners were bewildered and astonished by the illusion. Interestingly, many listeners claimed they could only access a single interpretation of the stimulus, suggesting that the percept is very stable\u2014and probably contributing to the widespread debate on the sound file. In essence, the world had discovered an acoustic equivalent to #TheDress [1].\\n\\nThe reason for the robust perceptual divide becomes clear when we look at the acoustic signal in a bit more detail. Figure 1 shows the spectrogram of the original signal (center) and articulations of Laurel (left) and Yanny (right) [2].\\n\\nThe spectrographic representations in Figure 1 show that the two spliced recordings of Laurel (left) and Yanny (right) are particularly different in one respect: Laurel shows high acoustic energy (red) in the lower frequency domain, while Yanny shows high acoustic energy in both the lower and upper (~2K Hz) frequency domains. The ambiguous, original Yanny v. Laurel recording (center) displays a bit of both: here, higher frequencies (> 2K Hz) are particularly strong, especially in the first 400ms of the signal (shown as the downwards trajectory at around 3K Hz from 0 to c. 0.4s). It is unclear why that is, perhaps because of the (poor quality) device the student had used to record the alleged articulation of Laurel. It has been argued that this pronounced energy is what triggers the ambiguity: some listeners interpret it as the F3 of /\u0254/ and hear Laurel [2], while others perceive it as the F2 of /\u00e6/ and hear Yanny. When the file is perceived as Yanny, the /\u00e6/ sounds raised and fronted, typical of American English pre-nasal TRAP tensing [3]. Because of the acoustic ambiguity in the signal, our minds have several degrees of freedom in how the stimulus can be interpreted, which then manifests in different proportions of percepts: for example, using a crowdsourcing approach to survey 532 listeners, [2] reports 60% Laurel, 30% Yanny, and 10% mixed percepts.\\n\\nSeveral studies have conducted signal manipulations to explore whether listeners can be induced to hear one percept or the other: [4] for instance, exposed participants to either low-pass or high-pass filtered versions of the original ambiguous stimulus. The low-pass filtered version triggered more Laurel percepts and the high-pass filtered version more Yanny percepts \u2013 which was expected, as Laurel has greater energy in the lower frequency regions and Yanny contains a high amount of energy in both lower and higher regions. [2] conducted a more nuanced attempt to induce one or the other percept by modulating lower and higher frequencies in a 7-step continuum. Figure 2 illustrates this continuum, which gradually triggered more\"}"}

Listening equipment, experience, listeners' first language, context, and gender all seem to play a role. [4] showed that (self-reported) listening equipment affects listener responses: over-ear and in-ear headphones triggered a higher proportion of Laurel percepts than laptop speakers did. Secondly, experience\u2014operationalized via 'musicality'\u2014appears to be crucial: musically-inclined listeners heard a higher proportion of Laurel [4]. In terms of listener language, [4] found that L1 Anglophone listeners were more likely to perceive a higher proportion of Laurel compared to L1 Francophones. Finally, recent evidence suggests that context plays a role in priming one percept or the other: [2] played audio precursors before the Yanny v. Laurel stimulus; the sequences were either low-pass or high-pass filtered. If the precursor was low-pass filtered, the subsequent percept tended toward Yanny because listeners paid more attention to higher frequencies in the target stimulus (and Yanny has more acoustic energy in the higher frequencies than Laurel); vice-versa for the high-pass filtered precursors. Finally, existing research also recognizes the role of listener gender in the percept of Yanny or Laurel: [4] reported men to perceive a higher proportion of Laurel.\\n\\nThe generalizability of this previous research is not entirely unproblematic, however. All of these studies have relied on crowdsourced, self-reported data, which is notoriously noisy. [2], for example, did not collect data on the 532 participants' genders, ages, first languages, or listening equipment, even though these factors have been reported to affect perception.\\n\\nThe study is somewhat unsatisfactory because they appear to have used a predominantly binary forced choice paradigm on their 289 participants. While they did consider what listening equipment was used by the participants, they did not collect information on the electronic devices used, which could possibly play a role since devices have different frequency responses [6].\\n\\nThe purpose of the present study, then, is to explore the percept of the Yanny v. Laurel stimulus in a more controlled fashion and with a balanced listener sample.\\n\\nGiven the previous literature, going into the study we expected to find an effect of gender, electronic device, and musicality. We further predicted a potential effect of region, given substantial variation in vowel quality, quantity, and phonotactics across Swiss German dialects (cf. [7])\u2014the assumption being that listeners have a perceptual preference for phoneme sequences that are more frequent in their dialect [8]. We further expected competence in English to play a role, given that competence in an L2 can affect discrimination ability in that foreign language [9]. Finally, we suspected age to play a role: as mentioned, the words Yanny and Laurel differ particularly in the higher frequency regions; these regions are likely to be attenuated in the hearing of elderly speakers, thus triggering higher proportions of Laurel percepts in older listeners.\\n\\n2. Methods\\n\\n2.1 Material\\n\\nThe original Yanny v. Laurel stimulus was retrieved from https://twitter.com/CloeCouture/status/996218489831473152 and was normalized in amplitude to 69dB in Praat [10].\\n\\n2.2 Listeners\\n\\nOne thousand listeners from 125 localities across German-speaking Switzerland participated in this study. They came from eight major regions, covering all major areas in German-speaking Switzerland (Cantons of Bern, Zurich, Grisons, Aargau, Northwestern Switzerland, Northeastern Switzerland, Fribourg, Valais & Ticino, as well as Central Switzerland \u2013 survey site selection is described in [11]). Figure 3 shows the survey sites.\\n\\nFigure 3: Survey sites from SDATS [10].\\n\\nThe sample consisted of 500 males and 500 females who took part in the SDATS project [12]. Half of the speakers belonged to a younger cohort and half to an older cohort (younger cohort mean age: 26, SD=4.8; older cohort mean age 70, SD=6.6). 55% claimed to be musical (i.e., sang or played an instrument in their free time or professionally), 36% had a tertiary education degree, and 37% used English on a regular basis and were relatively proficient (mean 3.3 on a 7-point rating scale). 23% of the participants had impaired hearing. Questions on hearing impairment and musicality were not mandatory, however, and 26 participants did not provide this information. For this reason, they were excluded from the sample, which meant the final dataset consisted of N=974 participants.\"}"}

Laurel. Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, data collection occurred remotely for most listeners (76.2% of the full dataset). Remote participants were generally located at their homes and linked with us on Zoom as we guided them through the linguistic tasks; they recorded their responses remotely on their smartphones using a bespoke app (cf. [1, 3] for a description of the recording setup). Figure 4 demonstrates the prompt enabling the collection of responses to the Yanny v. Laurel stimulus.\\n\\nListeners were instructed to carefully listen to the supervisor\u2019s explanations (cf. Figure 4, left panel) before clicking \u2018play\u2019 on the next slide (cf. Figure 4, right panel). Output volume was set at a comfortable level from a previous task. Listeners were instructed to play the file only once and then record their answer. 54% of the listeners heard the stimulus on a device running iOS, 38% Android, and 8% (N=79) on laptops (all Macs with varying specifications), using SpeechRecorder [1, 4]. The 79 laptop-based participants completed the survey in a face-to-face setting. Of the Android devices, 23% were Samsung, 7% Huawei, and 70% other makes. None of the participants used headphones. Response data was coded as Yanny, Laurel, or \u2018mixed\u2019 (which included responses such as \u2018none of the above\u2019, \u2018both\u2019, Yowrie, Yowrel, Yerry, etc.).\\n\\nNominal logistic regressions were run with \u2018Yanny, Laurel, mixed\u2019 as response and age, gender, device, region, musicality, hearing impairment, English use and competence as predictors. Age*musicality, gender*device, age*device, age*region, and gender*region were included as potential interaction terms.\\n\\n3. Results\\n\\nThe predictor of region was not significant, nor were any of the interaction terms; hearing impairment, use of English, and English competence were colinear with age, so these predictors and interaction terms were removed from the final statistical models.\\n\\n3.1 Overall distribution\\n\\nOverall, 62.2% reported hearing Yanny, 26.4% Laurel, and 11.4% heard a mixed version, cf. Figure 5. The multinomial logistic regression model to ascertain the role of age, gender, device, and musicality on the likelihood of a Yanny, Laurel, or mixed percept was statistically significant ($R^2=.05$, $F(10, 974)$, $p<.001^*). Table 1 shows the main effect likelihood ratio tests.\\n\\nFigure 5: Distributions of Yanny, Laurel, or mixed percepts.\\n\\nTable 1: Main effects in the percept of Yanny, Laurel or mixed.\\n\\nThe strongest predictor of percept was age, followed by gender and device. Musicality was non-significant but just above the $p=.05$ threshold ($p=.0665$).\\n\\n3.2 Age\\n\\nFigure 6 shows the relative proportions of the three percepts by age group. Older listeners ($60+$) had substantially more mixed percepts (18.5%) than younger participants (20\u201335; 4.5%) \u2013 at the cost of having much fewer Yanny percepts. Proportions of Laurel are almost identical across both age cohorts.\\n\\n3.3 Gender\\n\\nThe results obtained on gender and percept are shown in Figure 7. While proportions of mixed percepts are relatively similar across both genders, women heard substantially more Yanny (68.9%) than men (55.6%).\\n\\n3.4 Device\\n\\nFigure 8 shows the relative proportions of Yanny, Laurel, and mixed percepts across the different devices, cf. Figure 8.\"}"}

We did anticipate a much lower proportion of Yanny percepts compared to 62.2% in our study. This inconsistency unfortunately, not specified.\\n\\nThis \u2018overrepresentation\u2019 of low frequency exposure may explain the effects.
