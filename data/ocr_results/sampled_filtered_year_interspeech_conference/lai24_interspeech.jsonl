This paper aims to add to our knowledge of voice quality variation and how it interacts with ASR, by conducting three analyses using a new African American English (AAE) dataset. Acoustic analyses show robust differences between creaky voice and modal voice, suggesting cross-ethnic similarity in vocal fold articulation between AAE and Mainstream American English (MAE) speakers. In addition, we observed gender differences in creaky production both quantitatively (women > men) and qualitatively (women: medial partial creaks vs. men: final full creaks). This indicates that young AAE female speakers are participating in the phonation change taking place in MAE. We also found that the cr-ekier the speech, the more errors in ASR output, suggesting the importance of incorporating voice quality into ASR systems.\\n\\nIndex Terms\\ncreaky voice, phonation, voice quality, African American English, automatic speech recognition (ASR)\\n\\n1. Introduction\\nCreaky voice, also referred to as \\\"vocal fry,\\\" glottal fry, or laryngealization, is a type of phonation produced with extremely low F0 and irregular vibration of the vocal folds [1] which often signal utterance-finality. In American English, creak also appears in certain positions allophonically (e.g., 'button' [b\u028c\u0294n]) and can serve to communicate a speaker's affective stance. Over the past several decades, studies have shown that the acoustic characteristics of creaky voice are distinct from modal voicing (section 1.1). While speech-language pathologists had previously described creaky voice as pathological, sociolinguists have begun to document the increased use of creaky voice as a feature of the speech of young Americans (section 1.2). Scholarly work on voice quality also has implications for speech technology as various automatic creaky voice detection methods have been proposed to facilitate data annotation (section 1.3). Despite these findings, the ways in which the use of creaky voice varies by ethnicity have not been carefully examined. Additionally, the question of whether creakiness plays a role in speech recognition (in) accuracy in an era of increasing reliance on voice-AI has remained largely unexplored. This paper aims to address these gaps by analyzing data from a group of AAE speakers, since they employ a variety underrepresented in both the creaky voice literature and in the training dataset for voice technologies. This is particularly of interest due to the preponderance of data showing that AAE speakers experience an unacceptably high rate of errors in many ASR systems [2-5].\\n\\n1.1. Phonetic correlates of creaky phonation\\nThe body of work on phonation types has revealed a number of quantifiable properties in the articulatory, acoustic, and aerodynamic domains that can reliably distinguish modal voice from creaky voice [1]. In the present study, we focus on six measures of phonation that have been previously described as relevant to creaky phonation [6, 7] (Table 1):\\n\\nTable 1: Acoustic measures of phonation.\\n\\n| Measure | Explanation |\\n|---------|-------------|\\n| H1H2c  | The amplitude difference between the first and second harmonic, corrected for formants. |\\n| HNR05, HNR15, HNR25, HNR35 | The harmonic-to-noise ratios for 0-500 Hz, 0-1500 Hz, 0-2500 Hz, and 0-3500 Hz. |\\n| CPP    | Cepstral peak prominence, computed as the difference in amplitude between the cepstral peak and the regression line through the overall cepstrum. |\\n\\nAccording to Keating et al. [6, 7], for each measure, a lower value indicates a greater degree of creakiness.\\n\\n1.2. Sociolinguistic use and perception of creaky voice in the U.S.\\nRecent papers in sociolinguistic studies have reported frequent use of creaky voice among some American English speakers across the country. In particular, creaky voice has been described as frequent among young, white speakers in the Pacific Northwest [5, 6], Virginia [10], California [11, 12], Washington D.C. [13], Central Pennsylvania [14], and a variety of other locations. In addition to documenting its increased use, researchers have also described a number of social functions of creaky voice. For example, Lefkowitz and Sicoli [10] identified it as a marker of authoritative speech among college-age women. In one of the studies that focused on non-MAE speakers, Mendoza-Denton [11] associated creaky voice with gendered performance of being \\\"hardcore\\\" in Chicana gang girls' fight narratives. Podesva [13] observed that creaky voice can be used to index a professional woman persona, and Holliday [15] found ethnicity-related voice quality variation among Southern California youth, with AAE speakers being creakier than their Latinx peers.\"}"}

The (socio)distribution of creaky voice\\n\\nNow that we have established that modal voicing and creaky voice are acoustically distinct, we are interested in the sociolinguistic distribution of these voice quality types. When broken down by speaker gender, female speakers produced 86.3% modal voice and 13.7% creaky phonation, while male speakers used modal voice 91.9% of the time and creaky phonation 8.1% of the time.\\n\\nWe then focus on a subset of the data that contains partial or whole creak (n = 638) only to examine their distribution. Frequency analysis shows that male speakers contributed far fewer (28%, n = 181) creaky tokens to this dataset than female speakers (72%, n = 457). Among male speakers, full creaks (62%) occurred more often than partial creaks (38%). For female speakers, partial creaks (52%) were used slightly more often than full creaks (48%).\\n\\nWe then built a multinomial logistic regression model for position, with gender (male vs. female, reference level = male) as a predictor in R using the multinom function from the nnet package [33] to test for differences in creak distribution between male and female speakers. The regression analysis indicates that when moving from male to female speakers, the relative risk for producing medial creak increased by a factor of 1.04 (\u03b2 = 0.04), whereas when shifting from male to female speakers, the relative risk for producing final creak decreased by a factor of 0.56 (\u03b2 = -0.58). The gender differences are illustrated in Figure 2, which shows that despite voice quality, male speakers employed creaky phonation more frequently in utterance-final position than in medial position. Female speakers exhibited a rather different pattern as the creak occurred more often in medial than in final position, especially for partial creaks.\\n\\nFigure 2: Creaky production by position and gender.\"}"}

A previous study by Holliday, Lai, and van Hell [3] observed that young, white American English speakers, especially women, participate in the increased use of creaky voice among female MAE speakers. This matches previous findings, which have drawn evidence that phonation type, among other variables, has a substantial effect on ASR performance.\\n\\nThe present study aims to further our understanding of whether voice quality has an effect on speech recognition by examining its impact on ASR performance.

For this reason, it is imperative that ASR systems can incorporate voice quality into the acoustic model to ensure better performance. This finding, coupled with Yoon et al.'s [6] evidence that phonation type, among other variables, is an important factor for speakers of underserved ethnolects, given that a potential to improve user experience is also relevant for speech recognition, particularly for AAE speakers who regularly experience degraded performance in ASR systems.\\n\\nIn the future, it would help unpack how ASR systems utilize each of these acoustic measures, among which only 6 of them were considered in this study.
