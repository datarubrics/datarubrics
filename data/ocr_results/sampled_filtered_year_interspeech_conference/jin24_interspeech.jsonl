Introduction\\n\\nDespite the rapid progress of automatic speech recognition (ASR) technologies targeting single-talker, near-field speech [1, 2, 3], these regular methods and datasets [4, 5, 6] cannot handle the scenario where multiple speakers are presented simultaneously.\\n\\nExisting works on speech separation [7, 8, 9, 10] and multi-talker ASR [11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17] have been conducted on simulated multi-talker overlapping speech datasets [7, 18, 19, 20]. However, most of these datasets neither take reverberation in the far-field condition into consideration, nor deliver sufficient amount of data for the model to be generalized to other datasets [21, 22]. In addition, most of these datasets are simple cases with only 1 speaker turns, which does not match the real-world conversational scenarios where multiple speaker turns are common. Recently, some real-world recorded multi-talker overlapping speech datasets [23, 24] are proposed with far-field reverberation and multiple speaker turns presented. However, the amount of data delivered by these datasets is still not large enough due to the very high recording cost. Moreover, it is difficult to obtain clean separation targets from real-world recorded data, limiting their capability as training data for speech separation models.\\n\\nIn this work, we propose a 20,000-hour multi-talker overlapping speech dataset LibriheavyMix based on Libriheavy [6], which is a large-scale ASR corpus with richer information including punctuation casing and text context. We conduct preliminary experiments on speech separation and multi-talker ASR on the proposed dataset and present the corresponding baseline results. Compared with previous work, LibriheavyMix presents the following advantages:\\n\\n1. The amount of data is much larger than the others, with 10,000 hours.\\n2. Reverberation is introduced to simulate real-world far-field scenarios.\\n3. Multiple speaker turns, which is consistent with the real-world conversational scenarios, can be further used for speaker diarization [25, 26, 27, 28] and speaker-attributed ASR [29, 30, 31, 32].\\n4. Punctuation, casing and text context are inherent in transcripts, which can be further combined with the research of punctuation and semantic information [33, 34].\\n\\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the methods of data simulation. Section 3 shows the baseline systems of speech separation and multi-talker ASR. Section 4 shows experiments and results of baseline systems. Finally, Section 5 concludes this work.\\n\\n2. Data Simulation\\n\\nSimulation of Overlapped Speech:\\n\\nAs described in Algorithm 1, $D_{=spk}$, $D\\\\neq spk$ and $D_{ovlp}$ stand for the distribution of \u201cduration of pause between the same speaker\u201d, \u201cduration of pause between two different speakers\u201d and \u201cduration of overlapping\u201d respectively. The statistics of these distributions are derived from the target sessions provided, and the duration sampled from the distribution is utilized to blend the source utterances. Such a strategy is adopted as it has been successfully applied to improve end-to-end neural diarization [35].\\n\\nGiven the distribution of the target session on \u201cpause between the same speaker\u201d ($D_{=spk}$), \u201cpause between different speakers\u201d ($D\\\\neq spk$), \u201cduration of overlapping\u201d ($D_{ovlp}$) and \u201cprobability of overlapping\u201d ($P_{ovlp}$), a mixture $M$ of $k$ speakers with a maximum duration of $T$ is simulated by first sampling source utterances from the provided samples $U = \\\\{U_{s1}, \\\\ldots, U_{sk}\\\\}$ containing utterances from $S$ speakers, $k$ denotes the index for distinct speakers. The starting time of each of the selected utterances is sampled based on the speaker...\"}"}

The dataset is designed to mimic real-life conversations, featuring a variety of speaking styles and a broad range of acoustic environments. It serves as one of the publicly available benchmarks for evaluating speech separation and recognition systems, especially in reverberant and noisy conditions. Further experiments were conducted to evaluate the generalizability of the proposed dataset.\\n\\nThe Conv-TasNet model trained has 8.98 million parameters.

Since the SI-SDR is not defined for silent sources, training is done by minimizing the negative permutation-invariant, SI-SNR loss on 4-second segments. All systems were trained with identical parameters. Global layer normalization and ReLU are adopted for normalization and non-linearity respectively.
