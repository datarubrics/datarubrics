Cognitive Behavioral Therapy is a structured approach in psychotherapy, allowing the therapist to help the patient to identify and modify the malicious thoughts, behavior, or actions. This cooperative effort can be evaluated using the Working Alliance Inventory Observer-rated Shortened \u2013 a 12 items inventory covering task, goal, and relationship \u2013 which has a relevant influence on therapeutic outcomes. In this work, we investigate the relation between this alliance inventory and the spoken conversations (sessions) between the patient and the psychotherapist. We have delivered eight weeks of e-therapy, collected their audio and video call sessions, and manually transcribed them. The spoken conversations have been annotated and evaluated with WAI ratings by professional therapists. We have investigated speech and language features and their association with WAI items. The feature types include turn dynamics, lexical entrainment, and conversational descriptors extracted from the speech and language signals. Our findings provide strong evidence that a subset of these features are strong indicators of working alliance. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first and a novel study to exploit speech and language for characterising working alliance.\\n\\nIndex Terms: conversational analysis, working alliance, psychotherapy\\n\\n1. Introduction\\n\\nResearch interest in automatic behavioral analysis has been increasing in the past few years [1]. It has been proved that carefully designed, AI-enabled, Personal Healthcare Agents (PHA) [2] may improve many aspects of the treatment processes, including citizens' access to healthcare services and improvement of patients' adherence to medical prescriptions and wellbeing recommendations.\\n\\nTo reach those benefits, it is crucial that the design and implementation of PHA may rely on the understanding of the human therapeutic process, collaborative design, and on the availability of high-quality resources like annotated corpora of patient-therapist verbal interactions. A critical factor for the success of the PHA is the patients' engagement during the care process. In other words, like in human-human patient-therapist interactions, the establishment of a satisfactory therapeutic relationship. The different facets of such relationships have been investigated by psychologists and medical doctors in depth in the recent past [3, 4]. The concept of therapeutic alliance has emerged as a candidate for operationally describing the multiple intertwined factors that characterize compliance with medical prescriptions, user satisfaction, and a high chance of reaching benefits when setting and pursuing personal health goals.\\n\\nWhile this concept is general and applicable to all domains of healthcare, it is particularly crucial in mental healthcare because of the relevance of the bond that may be established between the therapists and their patients.\\n\\nIn this paper, we analyse patient-therapist spoken conversations collected over an eight-week Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) intervention in a real setting. The study aims at investigating the correlations between the conversation features and the patient-therapist working alliance. We describe the Working Alliance Inventory (WAI), the annotation process, and the inter-annotator agreement (IAA). The IAA results are very satisfactory and aligned with related studies using Cronbach\u2019s Alpha as IAA metric [5]. We have automatically extracted turn-taking, with other basic speech (e.g. duration and token), and language features from the conversations and correlated with WAI ratings. The turn-taking feature correlations show that equality in the engagement and acknowledgement utterances are relevant indexes of a good working alliance. The important role of the engagement is also observed in the most correlated turn-level features, which represent the speech activity at the segmentation and conversation levels. Furthermore, we have observed the same results on the discourse side, by measuring patient-therapist engagement through lexical entrainment for different word groupings and dialogue acts of these segments.\\n\\nOur analyses provide a strong evidence that the working alliance is manifested in speech and language. This result could provide support to further research in automatic behavioural analysis.\\n\\n2. Concepts underlying therapeutic relationship\\n\\n2.1. Working Alliance\\n\\nThe research on the evaluation of psychotherapy outcomes identified three key concepts that are frequently associated with good therapeutic results, measured in terms of satisfaction, acceptability, and symptom remission. The three concepts are proper information, cooperation, and commitment to achieve the objectives of treatment. While the concept of proper information pertains to the domain of ethics, cooperation and commitment to achieve treatment goals have been related to the construct of working (or therapeutic) alliance.\\n\\nAccording to many authors, the working alliance are one of the strongest predictors of the successful outcome of a psychotherapeutic path [6, 7]. In [8], the study shows the association between Alliance and Adherence, defined as the extent...\"}"}

The authors in [9] explain how this concept has been discussed in the perspective of the different theories, from its origin in the psychodynamic approach, up to the contemporary view as a pantheoretical concept. Following a pantheoretical way, the study [10] identified the three underlying factors (related components). The three underlying factors of working alliance are the mutual understanding and trust that therapist and client may establish (bond), their willingness of setting a shared goal (goal), and the purposive collaboration between them (task).\\n\\nDue to the importance of this construct in the determination of better results, over the years many researchers proposed questionnaires to measure the working alliance, for example, recently the authors in [5] studied the psychometric properties of this inventory for its application to self-assessment in online psychotherapy interventions.\\n\\n2.2. Working Alliance Inventory\\n\\nThe Working Alliance Inventory (WAI henceforth, [11]) is a questionnaire of items arranged on a Likert scale and is one of the most used to assess the alliance [7] according to the integrative model by Bordin [10]. The three specific factors (bond, goal, and task) mentioned above were examined by a specific confirmatory factor analysis [12], which allowed defining the 12-item short form of the inventory. The questionnaire has been validated both for self-assessment and for being administered by an observer [13], and both versions have been validated in several languages. In this study, we administered the Italian form of the W AI Observer-rated Shortened (W AI-O-S) version [13] as reported in [14].\\n\\n3. Corpus\\n\\n3.1. Description\\n\\nThe corpus is a collection of 23 Italian dyadic conversations during the sessions of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). The intervention can last from 5 to 20 sessions, each session of \\\\( \\\\approx 1 \\\\) hours, in which the patient works with the therapist on getting a better understanding of his/her issues. CBT therapy can reduce the impact on the patient\u2019s life of many symptoms, such as phobia, depression, anxiety, and bipolar disorders. In this corpus, three patients attended, via voice and video call, 8 therapy sessions. However, for one of the patients, the first session is missing.\\n\\nThe patient-therapist dialogues were manually transcribed. In all, the corpus is composed of 5.9K turns, the dictionary size is 8.1K words and the average turn length is 12 tokens. The dialogues were segmented into turns using the silent pauses between utterances, thus multiple consecutive turns can belong to the same speaker.\\n\\n3.2. Annotation task\\n\\nThe annotation task consisted of listening to the spoken conversation of a session and at the end of it, the annotators were asked to fill the W AI-O-S questionnaire by replying to the 12 questions listed in Table 1, by choosing a single option selection on a Likert scale from 1 (never) to 7 (ever). Two CBT experts performed the annotation of these therapeutic conversations. Based on those annotations, we computed the inter-annotator agreement (IAA) and the correlations to dialogue features.\\n\\nThe IAA has been computed with the Cronbach\u2019s alpha [15] metric; according to its interpretation table [16], we report: 15 questionnaires achieve excellent internal consistency (\\\\( \\\\alpha > 0.9 \\\\)), 4 good consistency (\\\\( 0.9 > \\\\alpha \\\\geq 0.8 \\\\)), 1 acceptable (\\\\( 0.8 > \\\\alpha \\\\geq 0.7 \\\\)), 1 questionable (\\\\( 0.7 > \\\\alpha \\\\geq 0.6 \\\\)), 1 poor (\\\\( 0.6 > \\\\alpha \\\\geq 0.5 \\\\)) and 1 unacceptable (\\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\geq 0.5 \\\\)). These values fall in line with other studies [5].\\n\\nTable 1: WAI items and their categorization in factors [12].\"}"}

Methods and Features\\n\\nTurn-taking Features\\n\\nWe extracted the turn-taking features by aligning outputs from speaker diarization sub-modules [20]. For the task, we utilized voice activity, overlap and speaker change detection using the raw dyadic audio. We aligned these automatic turn segments (short spurts/segments separated by at least 500ms silence) with the manual segmentation and then assigned manually annotated speaker role.\\n\\nUsing these segments, we extracted global features to understand conversation structure and participation. The features include:\\n\\n1. Participation equality [21, 18] \u2013 measuring the difference in the proportion of turn duration held by each speaker. We defined,\\n\\n   \\\\[ P_{eq} = 1 - \\\\frac{\\\\sum N_i (T_i - T)}{T_E} \\\\]\\n\\n   where \\\\( T \\\\) is the average speech duration of the speakers, \\\\( T_i \\\\) is the total speech duration for each speaker, \\\\( E \\\\) and \\\\( N \\\\) represent the maximum possible duration a speaker can hold and number of speakers. The value of \\\\( P_{eq} \\\\) closer to 1 indicates greater equality between speakers.\\n\\n2. Turn-level Freedom, [21, 18] \u2013 measuring the predictability of turn-taking structure, defined by\\n\\n   \\\\[ F_{cond} = 1 - \\\\frac{H_{max}(Y|X)}{H(Y|X)} \\\\]\\n\\n   where we calculated \\\\( H(Y|X) \\\\), the conditional entropy of speaker \\\\( Y \\\\) being the next speaker after \\\\( X \\\\) begins the turn, \\\\( H_{max}(Y|X) \\\\) being the maximal possible value for this.\\n\\n3. Overlapping turns [22, 19] \u2013 measuring the number and percentage of overlapping turns in the conversation.\\n\\nTurn-level Features\\n\\nAs the session unfolds, the turn properties of the speakers change. We have observed large differences in positional features such as the mean turn duration of therapists and patients which ranged from 12.6 to 22.8 seconds for the therapist and 8.0 to 14.6 seconds for the patient.\\n\\nMotivated by this, we extracted per speaker turn duration, token count, speech rates and pause-based (between and within the speakers) features for different parts (beginning/center/end), as well as the total percentage of speaking time for the interlocutors during the whole conversation like.\\n\\n4.2. Results\\n\\nThe estimated Pearson correlation (with \\\\( p \\\\text{-value} < 0.05 \\\\)), along with the regression slope, between the WAI-O-S ratings and the global turn-taking measures are reported in Table 2. The results indicate that an equal engagement (\\\\( P_{eq} \\\\)) from both interlocutors can lead to better working alliance for Task (WAI 1, WAI 2, WAI 12), Goal (WAI 11) and Bond (WAI 5).\\n\\nThe result also pinpoints the more unpredictable turn-taking strategy the therapist used (for e.g., giving short feedback signals, showing agreement between patient's turns, or giving patient more speaking time) often leads to better alliance scores for all the Task factors. Furthermore, we observed a slight positive effect of increase number of short overlapping spurt with Task (WAI 2, WAI 12) and Bond (WAI 5). This suggests that short feedback utterances are important for modelling a healthy alliance between the speakers.\\n\\nMoreover, we observed a positive correlation between the minimum observed rate of speech of the therapist and the score for Task (WAI 8) and Bond (WAI 9). We hypothesize that the more mutual trust observed between patient and therapist, the therapist is more comfortable to talk faster. This also shows that the therapist is well-aware of the patient's agreement towards the treatment plan.\\n\\nIn addition to the global features, we also observed correlation with other positional turn information. We noticed, the median duration of the patient speaking in any observed time window is positively correlated (\\\\( \\\\rho = 0.64 \\\\)) with the belief that the patient and therapist are working on his/her problems correctly (WAI 12). We hypothesize that the more regular the client engages in the conversation with the therapist, the more he/she is motivated to be working on his/her problems correctly.\\n\\nWe also observe a significant negative correlation (\\\\( \\\\rho = -0.55 \\\\)) between the standard deviation of the therapists' turn duration and the rating for WAI 11. The more variation there is in therapists' turn duration, the less common understanding there is between patient and therapist on the changes that would benefit the patient. This could mean, long stretches of the therapist talking to the patient (schooling/telling) instead of talking with the patient, followed by a time that has more of a conversation characteristic. This hypothesis is also backed by the correlation coefficient seen between total percentage of turn duration belonging to patient (\\\\( \\\\rho = 0.58 \\\\) for WAI 12 and \\\\( \\\\rho = 0.43 \\\\) for WAI 11).\\n\\n3 A Negative correlation is seen with therapist's total percentage of turn duration.\"}"}

Meaning the more the client talks (engages in the conversation) during the middle part of the therapy session the more confidence he or she has that the therapist can help him or her.\\n\\n5. Lexical Entrainment\\n\\nThe lexical entrainment is the phenomena in which a speaker conveys information reusing terms spoken by the other interlocutor. Furthermore, [23] defined a metric to estimate the entrainment, which effectiveness was tested on predicting the perceived naturalness of a dialogue.\\n\\nThe metric is defined as:\\n\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\text{ENTR}(c) = \\\\frac{-\\\\sum_{w \\\\in c} \\\\text{count}_{S_1}(w) - \\\\text{count}_{S_2}(w)}{\\\\sum_{w \\\\in c} \\\\text{count}_{S_1}(w) + \\\\text{count}_{S_2}(w)}\\n\\\\]\\n\\nwhere \\\\( c \\\\) is a target word class and \\\\( \\\\text{count}_{S_i}(w) \\\\) is the frequency of the word \\\\( w \\\\) used by the speakers \\\\( S_1 \\\\) and \\\\( S_2 \\\\). The word frequencies are computed over the set of dialogues selected for the estimation of the entrainment. We have used the entrainment metric to analyze possible correlations with the normalized WAI ratings and entrainment rating. We hypothesize that WAI ratings, which assess the working alliance between patient and therapist, should have a relation with entrainment metrics measuring user engagement.\\n\\n5.1. Methods and Results\\n\\nIn previous research [23], the word classes built to compute the entrainment were based on word frequencies, for instance, selecting the top 25 or 100 most frequent words of the whole corpus. In Table 3, we report the Pearson correlations between entrainment and WAI ratings for the top-25 most frequent words across the whole corpus (23 conversations). These words are reported in the first row of Table 3. We have further extended this analysis to all the words in the dictionary. We compute entrainment scores for each patient's conversation. For each patient, we sort by frequency the words occurring in his/her conversations. We have then processed the sorted word list with a sliding window of 100 words and an overlap of 85 words. This process has generated 66 word-bins per patient. For each bin, we compute the entrainment scores (eq. 1) for each patient's conversation. We correlate the entrainment scores, using Pearson correlation, with the 23 WAI ratings of a particular question. Due to the overall good inter-annotator agreement, we averaged the WAI ratings of the two annotators. Table 4 reports the highest correlation values amongst all word bins and WAI items. We have analyzed the part-of-speech of these words, using Spacy part-of-speech tagger, and have found 75% of the words are content words, i.e. they fall in one of these categories nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, and main verbs. In the first column of Table 4, we show representative words in the bin for the corresponding WAI question. We have inspected these words and the context they appear. We manually categorize these words in terms of their discourse function according to the Dialogue Act standard ISO-24617-2 [24]. From this, we observe that inform, agreement and offer discourse functions correlate well with Task (WAI 1, WAI 12, WAI 2). While feedback and request discourse functions correlate with Goal (WAI 11) and Bond (WAI 5), respectively.\\n\\nTable 3:\\n\\n| WAI (Factors) | WAI 12 (Task) | WAI 11 (Goal) | WAI 5 (Bond) | WAI 2 (Task) | WAI 1 (Task) |\\n|---------------|--------------|---------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|\\n| Corr          | 0.52         | 0.46          | 0.46         | 0.45         | 0.44         |\\n| Slope         | (1.17)       | (1.32)        | (1.45)       | (1.41)       | (0.91)       |\\n\\nTable 4:\\n\\n| Dialogue Act | WAI (Factors) | Corr | Slope |\\n|--------------|---------------|------|-------|\\n| Inform       | WAI 1         | 0.64 | (2.59) |\\n| Agreement    | WAI 12        | 0.64 | (2.45) |\\n| Offer        | WAI 2         | 0.63 | (3.41) |\\n| Feedback     | WAI 11        | 0.62 | (3.43) |\\n| Request      | WAI 5         | 0.61 | (3.71) |\\n\\n6. Conclusions\\n\\nWe have presented the analysis of patient-psychotherapist conversations collected during an eight-week CBT intervention on three patients. We described the WAI assessment scheme of the working alliance, and then detailed the annotation task of these spoken conversations. Following, we analysed features extracted from speech and language cues to find correlations with the WAI ratings. We empirically showed that turn-taking structure in the session is evidently a predictor of WAI. We observed that encouraging participation equality and more patient turn time is a strong feature for higher WAI ratings. From the language side, we noticed higher use of feedback, along with inform, request discourse functions correlates significantly with higher WAI ratings. These results provide insights into the future work on automatically computing the working alliance in therapeutic sessions and extension to other health domains.\\n\\n7.
