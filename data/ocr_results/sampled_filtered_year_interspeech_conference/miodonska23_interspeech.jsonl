We analyzed speech samples collected through a picture naming test from 11 children showing this retroflex-to-dental production pattern. The language material included words with /\u00f9/ and /s/ in various word positions. We extracted a set of spectrum-based acoustic features from the recorded sibilants and conducted the analysis using linear mixed-effect models. The models showed that significant acoustic differences (p < 0.05) can be found between realizations of /s/ and /\u00f9/ substituted by [s]. The main differences were detected in the amplitudes of fricative formants and the energy levels in specific subbands of the frication noise. The study provides preliminary evidence of the existence of covert contrasts in the analyzed substitutions.\\n\\nIndex Terms: child speech, covert contrast, sibilants, Polish\\n\\n1. Introduction\\n\\nThe acquisition of the phonological system of one's language is a process that happens over years. Researchers of child speech (including speech therapists, pediatricians, and psycholinguists) assume that the process of speech acquisition proceeds in stages, and that the child masters the correct pronunciation around the age of 6;0 [1, 2, 3]. Deviations from the adult pronunciation may be related to insufficient efficiency of articulators, problems with word-form encoding, or to the developmental state of the phonological grammar [4, 5]. Speech sounds that require more precise articulatory movements are initially pronounced as simpler sounds.\\n\\nOne of the examples of this phenomenon can be found in Polish: the realization of the retroflex phonemes /\u00f9, \u00fc/ as fricatives with a dental place of articulation. It is often described as a substitution, which suggests that this realization is identical to the realization of the phonemes /s/ or /z/ [6, 7]. However, our hypothesis is that this pronunciation may reflect a covert contrast that has not been explored and described in Polish so far. Covert contrast is a situation in which children in the process of acquisition and improvement of speech realize different phonemes by contrasting them acoustically or articulatory in a way that is not audible to the adult listener \u2013 the adult brain interprets these sounds as identical despite the presence of differences detectable in acoustic analysis, electropalatography or ultrasound [8, 9]. This phenomenon occurs as a transitional stage in the child's mastering of phonemic contrasts of the language, serving as an indicator of whether a given segmental contrast already has a representation in the child's mental lexicon. Some studies confirming the presence of covert contrasts in children's speech are available concerning both typically developing children and children with speech disorders (e.g. [10, 11]). Song et al. [12] showed that covert contrasts not only occur during the acquisition of a first language but also in second-language learners. Some authors report that children whose pronunciation showed a covert contrast had a better prognosis in speech therapy than children not realizing any contrast [13], indicating the potential for clinical use of this phenomenon. Two previous studies on this subject analyze sibilants [10, 14], but to date there is no similar research concerning this matter in Polish.\\n\\nSibilant sounds \u2013 including Polish sibilants \u2013 have been investigated for many years. Most of these studies regard adult speakers [15, 16, 17, 18, 19], but there are several studies concerning children [20, 21, 22, 23]. The acoustic features most commonly investigated are spectral moments [18, 24, 25, 26] and spectral peaks (formants of the frication band) [27, 23, 19]; some authors also take into account energies of the noise band [27, 28] or mel-frequency coefficients and their derivatives [16, 29]. Selected acoustic aspects of fricative productions in Polish children have been investigated before [30, 23, 27]. \u0141obacz & Dobrzanska analyzed the features of Polish fricatives in the speech of 19 typically developing children aged 4\u20137 [23]. The analysis showed that the fricative formants occur at significantly higher frequencies in dental sibilants than in retroflex fricatives. The researchers also confirmed the relationship between the speaker's age and the gradual approximation of fricatives to the adult-like norm. In one of our previous works, we investigated the acoustics of articulation of Polish preschool children with and without sigmatism [27]. We showed that the acoustic features based on the frication noise band help distinguish different patterns in the pronunciation of retroflex fricatives. However, according to our knowledge, no studies consider the possibility of a covert contrast between perceptually indistinguishable realizations of different phonemes in Polish. Evidence of the existence of covert contrasts in the population of Polish-speaking children would be a significant step toward a better understanding of the process of speech development.\\n\\nThe present study aims to investigate whether the dental substitutions of retroflex sibilants in Polish children's speech are an example of a covert contrast. We examined speech samples from eleven Polish children who realized retroflex fricative /\u00f9/ as dental [s], comparing these phones to productions of phoneme /s/ realized as [s] by the same children. The analysis employed linear mixed-effect models and was based on spectrum-based acoustic features: spectral moments, fricative formants, and frication noise energies. Our research question was whether retroflex-to-dental productions are acoustically different from dental-to-dental productions articulated by the same speakers.\"}"}

Materials and Method\\n\\n2.1. Speech material\\nThe registration of the speech material used in the present study was performed as part of a larger project on the speech of preschool children. We conducted recordings in three urban-localized kindergartens in a group of 5-to-6 years old children. Each participant took a picture naming test consisting of 35 words containing Polish sibilant sounds in different word positions and a speech examination performed by an experienced SLP (speech-language pathologist). The aim of the examination was to determine the articulation patterns of sibilant sounds in the speech of children, i.e., whether sibilants were articulated according to the Polish standard pronunciation or, when this was not the case, whether we could determine pronunciation characteristics that would suggest a speech disorder for these specific sounds. All gathered acoustic material underwent an additional auditory assessment by an independent annotator (a linguist and an SLP) to ensure that the speech diagnostic description matched the recorded signals. The project was approved by the local Bioethical Committee.\\n\\nIn the present study, we used 12 words with a dental fricative /s/ or a retroflex fricative /\u00f9/ (Table 1). The recordings were conducted with a sampling frequency of 44.1 kHz and a resolution of 16 bps. We used a Panasonic WM-61 electret microphone with a 20 to 20,000 Hz frequency response. The distance between the microphone and the child's mouth was about 10 cm.\\n\\nThe children were not preselected in any manner, as we aimed to gather data that would reflect the speech patterns existing in the population of Polish preschoolers. The inclusion criteria were age (5 or 6 years old) and consent for participation in the study (a written one from the legal guardians and an oral one from the participant).\\n\\nTaking the abovementioned criteria into account, 79 children were found eligible and were included in the speech corpus. As the aim of the presented study was to analyze [s] realizations of the phoneme /\u00f9/, we selected all the speakers that were manifesting a normative articulation of /s/ and a dental realization of /\u00f9/. Overall, 11 children (8 boys and 3 girls) showed this production pattern and were included in the analysis.\\n\\n2.2. Signal preprocessing\\nWe performed segmentation and annotation of sibilants based on the spectrograms using a dedicated Matlab application. During the annotation stage, some items were rejected as they were highly distorted when the participant spoke very loudly or laughed. In some cases, the speaker did not know how to name the picture, so some data was missing. The remaining signals were normalized to range 0\u20131, partitioned into 20 ms frames with a 10 ms overlap, and windowed with a Hamming window. Finally, we calculated a short-time Fourier transform (STFT) with a spectral resolution of 50 Hz.\\n\\n2.3. Feature extraction\\nThe signals were then used to calculate literature-based acoustic features of the sibilants: spectral moments, fricative formants and noise band energies. The calculations were performed in accordance to the procedure described by Miodonska et al. [27].\\n\\n2.3.1. Spectral moments\\nThe four linear spectral moments were calculated for the spectral representation of the signal frame as:\\n\\n\\\\[ L_1 = \\\\frac{1}{N_{DFT}} \\\\sum_{n=0}^{N_{DFT}-1} p(n) \\\\cdot f_n, \\\\]\\n\\n\\\\[ L_m = \\\\frac{1}{N_{DFT}} \\\\sum_{n=0}^{N_{DFT}-1} p(n) \\\\cdot (f_n - L_1)^m, \\\\]\\n\\nwhere \\\\( p(n) \\\\) is the normalized power spectrum derived from the \\\\( N_{DFT} \\\\)-point DFT for \\\\( n \\\\)-th frequency band with a central frequency \\\\( f_n \\\\).\\n\\nWe employed spectral moments in a form that corresponds to descriptive statistics of the spectrum:\\n\\n- mean, center of gravity: \\\\( \\\\text{CoG} = L_1 \\\\),\\n- standard deviation: \\\\( M_2 = \\\\sqrt{L_2} \\\\),\\n- skewness: \\\\( M_3 = \\\\frac{L_3}{(L_2)^{3/2}} \\\\),\\n- and kurtosis: \\\\( M_4 = \\\\frac{L_4}{(L_2)^2} - 3 \\\\).\\n\\nFurther analysis employed six spectral moments: \\\\( \\\\text{CoG}, M_2\u2013M_4 \\\\), and non-normalized versions of third and fourth spectral moments: \\\\( L_3 \\\\) and \\\\( L_4 \\\\).\\n\\n2.3.2. Fricative formants\\nThe fricative formants are understood as maxima of the spectrum envelope (spectral peaks) in the noise band accompanying the sibilant sounds. For fricative formant detection, we calculated linear predictive coding coefficients for each signal.\"}"}

Statistical analysis\\n\\nWe used linear mixed-effects (LME) models to evaluate acoustic differences between dental and retroflex sibilants assessed as having dental realization by the SLPs. In the collected corpus, the sibilants occurred in different phonetic contexts (different preceding and following vowels), so we decided to analyze 40% of the frames from the middle of each sibilant, thus reducing the coarticulation impact on the results. Overall, the analysis included 664 observations (301 \\\\( s \\\\) realizations of /\u00f9/ and 363 \\\\( s \\\\) realizations of /s/).\\n\\nFor each response variable (26 acoustic features described in Section 2.3), we tested several LMEMs with different random structures. Then, we used ANOVA to compare the models, starting with models best fit to the data (highest values of log-likelihood).

We averaged the power spectral density over all signal frames provided by individual speakers to see whether the differences in noise energies detected by LME models \\\\( NE_0, NE_7\u2013NE_9 \\\\) would be visible for particular participants. We found three basic patterns that occur in the speakers' spectra: (1) no contrast between the productions, (2) the contrast expressed in the altered formants structure, and (3) the contrast in the frication noise energy. Some speakers did not produce any significant acoustic contrast concerning spectral energies or fricative formant structure in the investigated realizations. The example of speaker M8's productions' spectra is presented in Fig. 1. In this case, the shape of the spectral envelope in the analyzed band and the amplitudes of specific frequency components are very similar for productions of both phonemes. A different pattern can be observed in the sibilants produced by speaker F3 (Fig. 2). The averaged spectra for investigated sounds differed significantly, mostly in the amplitudes of the spectrum components: the spectral energies in retroflex-to-dental productions were consistently lower than in dental-to-dental. In the case of speaker M6 (Fig. 3), we observe a different structure of the spectral peaks: the noise subband with the highest energy occurs in lower frequencies for /\u00f9/ realizations than in /s/. This is compliant with the differences...\"}"}

Conclusions\\n\\nAccording to our knowledge, the present study is the first reported attempt to investigate the acoustic nature of sibilant substitutions from the perspective of a possible covert contrast. Our results show that significant acoustic differences in the features of the frication band spectrum can be found between realizations of /s/ and /\u00f9/ substituted by [s]. This provides preliminary evidence of the existence of covert contrasts in the retroflex-to-dental substitutions in the pronunciation of Polish preschool children.\\n\\n5.
