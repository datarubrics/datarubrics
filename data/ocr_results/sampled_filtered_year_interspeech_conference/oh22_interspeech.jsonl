Overall, phrases under focus have greater vertical larynx displacement and lower onset positions, compared to the non-focus condition (except for Speaker A). Moreover, across conditions, the LX displacement decreases over time through the sentence, indicating the diminished gestural magnitude near the end of an utterance. Despite this trend, the focused phrase, which is near the end of the utterance, still exhibits a larger displacement than that of its unfocused counterpart. As a whole, the results show that vertical larynx actions are spatially conditioned by the prosodic planning of focus implementation.\\n\\nFigure 5: LX displacement and LX onset position by each speaker.\"}"}
