However, previous research has mostly focused on the phonemic contrast between English /l/ and /r/, providing little evidence in the acquisition of positional allophones, such as those in English /l/.\\n\\nThe current study investigates the acoustics and articulation of allophonic variations in English laterals produced by Japanese speakers, focusing on the effects of syllabic positions and flanking vowels. Acoustic and articulatory data were obtained from five Japanese speakers in a simultaneous audio and high-speed ultrasound tongue imaging recording setup while they read sentences containing syllable-initial and -final tokens of English /l/ in four different vowel contexts. Acoustic analysis was conducted on 500 tokens using linear mixed effects modelling and the articulatory data were analysed using generalised additive mixed modelling.\\n\\nSyllable position and vowel context had significant effects on acoustics, while midsagittal tongue shape was more influenced by vowel context, with fewer positional effects.\\n\\nThe results demonstrate that differences in acoustics not always be mirrored exactly by midsagittal tongue shape, suggesting multidimensionality of articulation in second language speech.\\n\\nIndex Terms: articulation, acoustics, English laterals, second language speech, ultrasound tongue imaging\\n\\n1. Introduction\\n\\nIn second language speech learning, it is well-established that the phonetics and phonology of a learner's first language (L1) interferes with acquisition of nonnative sounds in a native-like manner [1], [2]. The Speech Learning Model (SLM) posits that acquisition of position-sensitive allophones is seen as the fundamental mechanisms of second language (L2) speech learning [3]. However, while acquisition of the English liquid contrast between /l r/ by Japanese speakers has been well studied, there have been relatively fewer studies that investigate acquisition of allophonic variation in English /l/.\\n\\nThe two canonical allophonic variants of English /l/, typically referred to as clear-L and dark-L, are acoustically distinguished by F2 and the distance between F2 and F1 [4]. Clear-L, typically occurring in a syllable-initial position or before a consonant, shows higher F2 and greater F2-F1 distance than the darker, syllable-final variant [5]. The clear and dark /l/s exhibit different sequence and magnitude concerning the tongue tip (TT) and tongue dorsum (TD) gestures [6], [7]; L-lowering of F2 for the dark-L and resultant smaller F2-F1 value could correspond to the retraction and raising of TD [6], [8]. Previous articulatory studies show that the TD gesture is the key in understanding allophonic variations in laterals. However, due to lack of articulatory data in L2 speech research, we do not know what articulatory properties correspond to lateral allophony, given that L2 speakers could plausibly use different strategies from L1 speakers. In the case of Japanese, previous research demonstrated that Japanese /r/ lacks the specific TD gestural target, based on the extent of variability across vowel contexts, which could also affect the way Japanese speakers articulate syllable-initial and final /l/ [9]. In addition, a great degree of individual variation can be expected in the articulatory domain; for instance, at least seven patterns of tongue postures were discovered in production of English /r/ by native Japanese learner speakers of English with varying proficiency in English, which made it difficult to establish a clear relationship between acoustics and articulation (e.g., lower F3) [10].\\n\\nThe current study examines two predictions: (1) if the articulatory properties of nonnative sounds are influenced by those of the closest native category, given the variability in the TD gesture for Japanese /r/, the posterior tongue is also likely to be highly variable depending on the vowel context in English /l/; (2) changes in articulatory properties may not always be manifested in acoustics, making it difficult to generalise what articulatory strategies would contribute to the changes in F2 and F2-F1 in the case of English /l/.\\n\\nIn the following section, I will report a study that investigates Japanese speakers' production of the allophonic variations in English laterals. Specifically, we compare the effects of: (1) syllable position and (2) vowel contexts on acoustics and articulation.\\n\\n2. Methods\\n\\n2.1. Participants\\n\\nFive L1 speakers of Japanese (two female: \u201cJP01F\u201d and \u201cJP04F\u201d, and three male: \u201cJP02M\u201d, \u201cJP03M\u201d, and \u201cJP05M\u201d) participated in this study. They were aged between 23 and 30 years (M = 24.6 years) and enrolled in a university in the UK for a postgraduate study. All of them defined themselves as native speakers of Tokyo Japanese, and their English proficiency was considered to be high given their enrolment status at the UK university as well as their self-reported assessment. None of them reported speech and hearing impairment at the time of the recording.\\n\\n2.2. Materials\\n\\nThe stimuli were developed to elicit /l/s occurring in syllable-initial and -final positions in a controlled manner. The list of target words is shown in Table 1. The material development conceptually followed previous studies [11], [12]. First, target words were determined such that words embedding both on-set and coda tokens of /l/ share same sets of phonemes, differing...\"}"}

For example, we used leave /li\u02d0v/ for a syllable-initial lateral whereas veal /vi\u02d0l/ for a syllable-final lateral. Overall, F1 was higher syllable-finally than syllable-initially, except for the speaker JP04F. F2 was lower syllable-finally than syllable-initially, except for the speaker JP04F.\\n\\nAs a result of some tokens having to be excluded due to the presence of factors such as glottalisation or the absence of a complete lateral portion, only 245 final tokens were available for inclusion in the analyses. This was necessary because the F2 values were not entered into the model if the lateral portion was not identifiable; thus, the F1 values were entered into the model. In the analyses of the F2 values, it was observed that 1) there was an abrupt change in F2, 2) a decrease in resonance energy on formant transitions, and 3) a decrease in waveform amplitude for each lateral token, with flanking vowels being present in each case.\\n\\nIn the previous research, the lateral portion was delimited on the acoustic signal, visualised as X and Y values, delimiting the lateral portion on the acoustic signal, with the X and Y values then normalised by speaker. The lateral tokens from the neighbouring vowels were then embedded in a carrier phrase to (someone's) boss. Simultaneous acoustic and ultrasound data were obtained using the Telemed MicrUs system, with a 64 element probe of 20 mm radius and a 7 MHz transducer. The ultrasound signals were amplified and digitised using the AAA software, meaning that ultrasound synchronization errors in the lateral tokens from the neighbouring vowels were minimal.\\n\\nThe ultrasound data were imaged with a 64 element probe of 20 mm radius and a 7 MHz transducer, with midsagittal tongue images sampled at 2 MHz, and normalised by speaker. Ultrasound data were obtained using the Telemed MicrUs system, with a 64 element probe of 20 mm radius, and ultrasound images were imaged with a 64 element probe of 20 mm radius.\\n\\nThe ultrasound data were also used to determine the shape of tongue splines in the previous research to a clearer variant of English lateral, as a result of some tokens having to be excluded due to the presence of factors such as glottalisation or the absence of a complete lateral portion. Therefore, I only focus on within-speaker contrasts in realisations of English /l/.\\n\\nThe shape of tongue splines for words was not included in the analyses because it did not improve the model fit. Thus, a result, the interaction between position and vowel environment (i.e., /a_a/, /a_i/, /i_a/, and /i_i/) alone was included in the model's outcome variable, meaning that the acoustic analysis could improve the model fit. In the acoustic analysis, tongue splines were fitted with a generalised additive mixed models (GAMMs) package, meaning that the outcomes of the acoustic analysis were assessed whether tongue splines corresponded to the presence or absence of factors such as glottalisation or the absence of a complete lateral portion.\\n\\nAs a result of the presence of factors such as glottalisation or the absence of a complete lateral portion, only 245 final tokens were available for inclusion in the analyses. In the analyses of the F2 values, it was observed that 1) there was an abrupt change in F2, 2) a decrease in resonance energy on formant transitions, and 3) a decrease in waveform amplitude for each lateral token, with flanking vowels being present in each case. The acoustic data were low pass filtered to 11,025 Hz, down sampled to 44.1 kHz with 16 bit quantisation, and then converted into polar coordinate using the mgcv package. The exported tongue data, consisting of X and Y values, were then imported into the software using the mgcv package, meaning that the outcomes of the acoustic analysis could improve the model fit.\"}"}

JP04F differentiated the two position-dependent variants in the A_I and I_A conditions but less so in the A_A and I_I contexts. JP03M differentiated the two allophones in the A_A and A_I contexts but to a lesser extent in the I_A and I_I environments.\\n\\nFinally, comparisons of several linear mixed-effect models demonstrate that there were significant effects of position ($\\\\chi^2(1) = 8.801$, $p = .003$), vowel ($\\\\chi^2(3) = 10.727$, $p = .013$), and the interaction between position and vowel ($\\\\chi^2(3) = 171.800$, $p < .001$).\\n\\nIn summary, the acoustic analysis based on the $F_2$-$F_1$ values suggest that Japanese speakers distinguish syllable-initial and syllable-final laterals, but the magnitude of this varies by vowel context. Particularly, visual inspections of the boxplots suggest that there is a difference in the initial-final contrast depending on the preceding vowel (/i/ vs /a/). We will then turn to the articulatory analysis to examine whether similar trends can be observed in the articulatory data.\\n\\n### 3.2. Articulatory analysis\\n\\nThe participants\u2019 tongue spline data are visualised by speaker in Figure 2. Based on the results from the acoustic analysis, the four vowel conditions have been collapsed into two categories for the preceding vowels /i/ vs /a/.\\n\\nGAMM models based on the polar coordinate were constructed using the polar_gam function in the articulate package separately for each speaker [25] with the tongue height (Y) as the outcome variable and separate smoothing spline terms of the X coordinate by position and vowel. Residual autocorrelations were reduced by specifying AR1 models for each speaker as the amount of autocorrelation at lag 1 [26]. Significance testing was conducted through model comparisons using the compareML function between the full model ($Y \\\\sim position + vowel + s(X, by = position) + s(X, by = vowel)$) and a model that did not contain a parametric term and a smooth term with the variable in by-parameter (Position model: $Y \\\\sim position + s(X, by = position)$; Vowel-context model: $Y \\\\sim vowel + s(X, by = vowel)$).\\n\\nFigure 2: Comparisons of tongue splines for initial (in orange) and final (in grey) for different vowel positions across four speakers with tongue tip pointing rightward (based on the Cartesian coordinates). A speaker JP04F was excluded due to the poor imaging quality. Overall, the full models significantly improved the model fit against the position-only models (i.e., without terms associated with vowel context) across speakers (JP01F; $\\\\chi^2(5.00) = 3589.510$, $p < .001$, JP02M; $\\\\chi^2(5.00) = 500.325$, $p < .001$, JP03M; $\\\\chi^2(5.00) = 522.015$, $p < .001$, JP05M; $\\\\chi^2(5.00) = 231.851$, $p < .001$) suggesting that vowel context significantly improved the model fit. On the other hand, there were no significant differences between the full models and the vowel-context models (i.e., without terms associated with position),\"}"}
