Using a dataset of sarcastic utterances compiled from television shows, we analyze the prosodic features within utterances and key phrases belonging to three distinct sarcasm categories (embedded, propositional, and illocutionary), which vary in the degree of semantic cues present, and compare them to neutral expressions. Results show that in phrases where the sarcastic meaning is salient from the semantics, the prosodic cues are less relevant than when the sarcastic meaning is not evident from the semantics, suggesting a trade-off between prosodic and semantic cues of sarcasm at the phrase level. These findings highlight a lessened reliance on prosodic modulation in semantically dense sarcastic expressions and a nuanced interaction that shapes the communication of sarcastic intent.\\n\\nIndex Terms: sarcasm, functional trade-off, prosodic cues, semantic cues\\n\\n1. Introduction\\n\\nA sarcastic sentence is one in which a speaker says the opposite of what they mean, adding irony and humor to language [1, 2]. Although it is used frequently, sarcasm poses distinct challenges in distinguishing it from neutral speech. Understanding the ways sarcasm is expressed and meant is crucial, not just for theory but for use in interactive spoken dialogue systems.\\n\\nOur investigation into previous research reveals diverse outcomes influenced by the languages under study and the methods employed to elicit sarcasm. In languages like English, French, Italian, German, and Cantonese, changes in the basic pitch, or fundamental frequency ($F_0$) are linked with sarcasm [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. However, its usage varies across languages. Studies in Cantonese, Italian, and French report an increase in mean $F_0$ to mark sarcasm, while studies in German demonstrated a reduced $F_0$ range [3, 7, 6, 8]. The divergence is particularly notable in studies focusing on English. [7] reported decreased mean $F_0$, $F_0$ range, and $F_0$ standard deviation as markers of sarcasm, while [4] observed an increased mean $F_0$ and $F_0$ range as cues of sarcastic speech. The mixed results are further complicated by different methods used to elicit sarcasm. For instance, distinct from the aforementioned studies, [10] observed that spontaneous ironic speech, extracted from talk radio shows, offered minimal evidence for distinguishable features.\\n\\nRecognizing the methodological diversity in previous sarcasm research, we integrate these varied approaches with a comprehensive methodology that combines elements from spontaneous and elicited sarcasm studies. This mitigates the disparities observed in prior findings, offering a holistic understanding of acoustic sarcasm markers. Apart from $F_0$, reductions in speech rate and the lengthening of syllables or entire utterances emerge as consistent features of sarcasm across languages. Changes in intensity have also been identified in sarcastic utterances across languages [3, 11]. However, diversity is noticeable even within English; [4] reported increased intensity in sarcastic utterances, while [5] found no corresponding increase compared to literal utterances.\\n\\nAnother confounding factor are the different types of sarcasm. For example, [10] differentiated between \u201cdry sarcasm\u201d, where sarcasm is inferred only from context, and \u201cdripping sarcasm\u201d, marked by explicit word choice and unambiguous prosody, finding that \u201cdry sarcasm\u201d featured a lower mean syllabic duration while dripping sarcasm exhibited a higher one. [5] further compared acoustic features in short phrases (i.e., \u201cYeah, right.\u201d) and long sentences, uncovering that speech rate varies with sentence length to indicate sarcasm, with shorter sentences marked by a slower speech rate. Such studies underscore the interplay between the kind of sarcasm and the diversity of cues employed.\\n\\nWe unravel the complexities of sarcastic meaning by investigating whether modulations of $F_0$, duration, and amplitude \u2013 parameters consistently associated with sarcastic speech across various languages \u2013 are intertwined with the level of context ambiguity behind sarcasm. We explore three major subtypes of sarcasm: embedded, provisional, and illocutionary. Each subtype is characterized by a distinct use of semantic cues, which are key elements our experiments aim to investigate for a deeper understanding of how sarcasm is conveyed. To ensure alignment with previous work, we focus on acoustic features that have shown significant correlation with sarcasm, including mean $F_0$, $F_0$ range, mean amplitude, and speaking rate.\\n\\nThe presence of semantic cues, often characterized by a mismatch between the context and the literal content, is a primary indicator of sarcasm. To further explore the interaction between these two types of cues, we propose to investigate how they compensate for each other in conveying sarcasm. Given the varied reliance on prosodic and semantic cues across different instances of sarcasm, it is crucial to understand how these cues interact, particularly in contexts where one type of cue may be less apparent. This leads us to consider a potential reciprocal dynamic, where the absence or presence of one cue type influences the reliance on and manifestation of the other. Based on the assumption, we propose the following hypothesis (H1):\\n\\nH1: There is a reciprocal relationship between the use of prosodic and semantic cues in conveying sarcasm. In the absence of semantic cues, speakers emphasize prosodic cues to signal sarcasm. Conversely, when semantic indicators of sarcasm are evident, the reliance on prosodic cues diminishes.\"}"}

Based on these insights, our study suggests that speakers strategically target semantically critical phrases within an utterance to convey sarcasm effectively. We focus on the semantically critical phrases within utterances, and examine whether sarcasm is distinguishable from neutrality based solely on these key phrases. For instance, in the utterance \u201cIt\u2019s just a privilege to watch your mind at work,\u201d the word privilege holds the key to the sarcastic interpretation of the statement. The example provided illustrates this point but raises questions about the systematicity of this phenomenon across different instances of sarcasm. Therefore, we endeavor to dissect these occurrences, examining whether such prosodic emphasis on key phrases is a consistent feature across different sarcastic contexts. We propose hypothesis (H2):\\n\\nH2: Prosodic features indicating sarcasm, such as changes in pitch or loudness, are predominantly found on specific phrases within a sentence that are crucial for imparting the sarcastic meaning. These key phrases serve as focal points for the application of prosodic sarcasm markers.\\n\\nThis paper delves into the intricate interplay between prosodic features and diverse types of sarcasm in spontaneous speech. Our contributions are:\\n\\n\u2022 We elucidate the nuances of sarcastic cues by revealing the interplay between prosodic cues of sarcasm and the various subtypes of sarcasm characterized by differing levels of context ambiguity.\\n\\n\u2022 We underscore the importance of incorporating key phrases that convey sarcastic meaning into studies examining sarcasm in speech, enriching our understanding of how sarcasm is expressed and perceived and presenting effective methods for examining intricate dialogue data.\\n\\n\u2022 We provide empirical evidence that certain speech features serve as indicators of sarcasm in spontaneous speech.\\n\\n\u2022 We delineate the interplay between prosodic and semantic cues in detecting sarcasm, providing insights that enhance the accuracy of spoken dialogue systems.\\n\\n2. Methodology\\n\\n2.1. Data\\n\\nOur experiments leveraged the MUStARD++ dataset \\\\[13\\\\], comprising 1202 audiovisual utterances extracted from American TV sitcoms. These utterances are evenly divided between sarcastic and non-sarcastic instances and are accompanied by preceding conversations and speaker information. Each utterance is annotated with emotions, including valence and arousal, to capture the polarity and intensity of emotion. The sarcastic utterances are further classified into three distinct types of sarcasm:\\n\\n\u2022 Propositional Sarcasm, comprising 333 utterances, relies on contextual cues for sarcasm identification \\\\[14\\\\]. For instance, without context, utterances such as \u201cIt\u2019s my privilege\u201d may not be readily recognized as sarcastic.\\n\\n\u2022 Embedded Sarcasm, encompassing 87 utterances, contains inherent incongruities within the utterance itself, rendering the sarcasm evident through the text alone. For example, \u201cYou could charge people money to punch you.\u201d\\n\\n\u2022 Illocutionary Sarcasm, represented by 178 utterances, utilizes non-verbal cues, such as prosodic features or visual cues, to convey sarcasm. In these instances, the spoken words may appear sincere, but the sarcasm is evident through non-textual signals \\\\[14\\\\]. An example would be saying \u201cThat\u2019s right\u201d while rolling one\u2019s eyes or emphasizing the word \u201cright\u201d, where literal neutrality contrasts with non-textual sarcasm.\\n\\nWe applied voice fix tools \\\\[1]\\\\,\\\\footnote{https://github.com/haoheliu/voicefixer} to remove background noise from the original audios.\\n\\n2.2. Annotation\\n\\nSince sarcastic utterances in the dataset differed lexically from non-sarcastic ones at the utterance level, it raises questions about the reliability of the reported findings when directly comparing sarcastic and non-sarcastic utterances. Therefore, we aim to examine the prosodic expression of sarcasm not only at the utterance level but also in the key phrases within an utterance. To facilitate comparison between the acoustic features of key phrases in both sarcastic and neutral utterances, we assigned two graduate students specializing in linguistics to conduct the annotation process, which involved two main steps.\\n\\nFirstly, we selected all sarcastic utterances from the Big Bang Theory (BBT) and instructed annotators to identify lexically meaningful words (mostly nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, and other content words) and phrases (hereafter referred to as key phrases) within each sentence. Exclamations (e.g., \u201coh\u201d, \u201cyeah\u201d) were also included, as they play an important role in conveying sarcasm. Building upon the annotated key phrases, we conducted an extensive search of utterances in BBT transcripts containing the key phrases spoken by the same speaker.\\n\\nSecondly, annotators labeled the curated utterances as neutral or non-neutral, guided by the videos of the utterance and its relevant context. Each annotator labeled the full set of utterances independently. Inter-annotation yielded substantial agreement (Kappa score: 0.6042). We only kept utterances labeled as neutral by both annotators. We exclude illocutionary sarcasm data (44 in total) signaled exclusively by video modality and only keep those signaled by audio modality.\\n\\n| Sarcastic | Non-Sarcastic |\\n|-----------|---------------|\\n| Utterance  | 87            | 333           | 134  | 601 |\\n| Key phrase | 38            | 38            | 38   | 63  |\\n\\nThe resulting set of annotations consists of 114 key phrases, with 38 belonging to each sarcasm category. Each key phrase within each sarcasm type has at least two non-sarcastic-sounding counterparts. In total, 361 audio samples are manually labeled for analysis.\\n\\n2.3. Acoustic analyses\\n\\nIn order to find the accurate timestamp for each key phrase, we use a transcription alignment tool Gentle \\\\[2]\\\\,\\\\footnote{https://github.com/lowerquality/gentle} which automat-\\n\\n\\\\[1]\\\\,\\\\footnote{https://github.com/haoheliu/voicefixer}\\n\\n\\\\[2]\\\\,\\\\footnote{https://github.com/lowerquality/gentle}\"}"}

Statistical analyses\\n\\nBased on these measures, we fit linear mixed effects models using lme4 in R to analyze the effects of the experimental variables on the acoustic measurements. Model significance was assessed with the lmerTest package.\\n\\nFor utterance level analysis, we included MESSAGE_TYPE (PRO: propositional sarcasm, EMB: embedded sarcasm, ILL: illocutionary sarcasm, and NONE: non-sarcasm) and GENDER (male, female) as the fixed factors and SPEAKER as the random factor. For keyword level analysis, we also included UTTERANCE as the random factor.\\n\\n3. Results and Discussion\\n\\nThe mean measures of F0, F0 range, amplitude, and duration characterizing different types of utterances and key phrases are summarized in Table 2. Since no significant differences have been found in the amplitude range at both utterance and phrase levels, this feature is omitted in Table 2 for clarity.\\n\\n3.1. Utterance-level features\\n\\nAs shown in Figure 1 and tested by statistical models, both sarcasm type and gender have significant effects on mean F0. Specifically, utterances expressing sarcasm have significantly lower mean F0 compared to non-sarcastic utterances (EMB: $\\\\beta = -26.94$, SE = 10.31, t = -2.61, p < .01; PRO: $\\\\beta = -24.21$, SE = 5.92, t = -4.09, p < .01; ILL: $\\\\beta = -26.04$, SE = 10.31, t = -2.61, p < .01).\\n\\nAs for F0 range, no significant differences have been found between sarcastic and non-sarcastic utterance types. In addition, sarcasm type has significant effects on mean amplitude. Utterances expressing sarcasm have significantly higher mean amplitude compared to non-sarcastic utterances (EMB: $\\\\beta = 3.57$, SE = 1.50, t = 2.39, p < .05; PRO: $\\\\beta = 3.85$, SE = 0.86, t = 4.48, p < .001; ILL: $\\\\beta = 3.14$, SE = 1.17, t = 2.68, p < .01).\\n\\nNo systematic differences have been found in F0 range and amplitude range across sarcasm types. At the utterance level, pair-wise comparisons of the three sarcasm types (EMB, PRO, ILL) show no significant difference between the acoustic features. Therefore, we observe no functional trade-off in terms of individual prosodic cues at the utterance level.\\n\\nTo summarize, sarcasm can be distinguished from neutrality based on prosodic patterns, with sarcastic expressions marked by a lower mean F0 and a higher mean amplitude at the utterance level irrespective of the speaker\u2019s gender and the context of these expressions, which are in general consistent with previous findings across languages.\\n\\nFigure 1: Utterance-level prosodic features across neutral (NONE) and the three sarcastic (EMB, PRO, and ILL) types.\"}"}
