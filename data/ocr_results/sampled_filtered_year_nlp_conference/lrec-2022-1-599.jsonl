The CEJC is designed to contain various kinds of everyday conversations in a balanced manner to capture their diversity. The CEJC features not only audio but also video data to facilitate precise understanding of the mechanism of real-life social behavior. The publication of a large-scale corpus of everyday conversations that includes video data is a new approach. The CEJC contains 200 hours of speech, 577 conversations, about 2.4 million words, and a total of 1675 conversants. In this paper, we present an overview of the corpus, including the recording method and devices, structure of the corpus, formats of video and audio files, transcription, and annotations. We then report some results of the evaluation of the CEJC in terms of conversant and conversation attributes. We show that the CEJC includes a good balance of adult conversants in terms of gender and age, as well as a variety of conversations in terms of conversation forms, places, activities, and numbers of conversants.\\n\\nKeywords: Corpus of everyday Japanese conversation, corpus design, corpus evaluation\\n\\n1. Introduction\\n\\nThe characteristics of languages and behaviors in conversations occurring in daily life are an important research theme. Although many corpora of Japanese conversations have been constructed, most have targeted conversations in artificially created settings in terms of topics and recording situations or were biased in terms of conversational situation. In addition, there is no corpus of Japanese conversations that provides video data, and some do not even provide audio data (see Table 1).\\n\\nGiven this situation, we have engaged since 2016 in the construction of the Corpus of Everyday Japanese Conversation, CEJC. The main features of the CEJC are i) a focus on conversations embedded in naturally occurring activities in daily life, ii) the variety of everyday conversations, collected in a balanced manner to capture the diversity of everyday conversations and observe natural conversational behavior in our daily life; and iii) the publication of audio and video data in order to precisely understand the mechanism of real-life social behavior. We published a part of the CEJC, 50 hours of conversations, in 2018 on a trial basis, and will publish the whole corpus, comprising 200 hours, in March 2022.\\n\\nIn this paper, we present an overview of the corpus, including the recording method and devices, structure of the corpus, formats of video and audio files, transcription, and annotations in the CEJC. We then report the results of the evaluation of the CEJC in terms of conversant and conversation attributes.\\n\\n2. Corpus Design\\n\\n2.1. Recording method\\n\\nTo capture various kinds of conversations in daily life, conversations in the CEJC were recorded on the basis of two recording methods \u2014 individual-based and situation-specific methods (Koiso et al., 2016a)\u2014 the designs of which were based on the recording methods of the spoken language part of the British National Corpus (Crowdy, 1995; Burnard and Aston, 1998).\\n\\nIndividual-based method\\n\\nOf the 200 hours comprising the CEJC, 185 hours, featuring 533 conversations, were recorded using the individual-based method. We recruited 40 informants, balanced in terms of gender and age (man/woman, 20s/30s/40s/50s/over 60), provided them with portable recording devices for approximately three months, and had them record around 15 hours of conversation in their daily activities. Table 2 shows the attributes of the informants. All informants recorded their everyday activities in a variety of situations, such as at home, at the office, at a restaurant, and outdoors. About four to five hours of conversations, around 15 hours per informant, were selected for the CEJC by taking into account the balance...\"}"}

By verifying the balance for 94 hours of conversations collected using the individual-based method in the middle of building the CEJC, it turned out that extra recordings on business situations and involving younger people were required. Then, total of 10 hours of business meetings and five hours of conversations by minors were recorded using the situation-specific method.\\n\\n2.2.

A wearable camera (Panasonic HX-A500 camera) was used for outdoor recording. The HX-A500 was mounted on or around the conversant's shoulder to capture what they were looking at. In addition to these cameras, Sony HDR-CX675 cameras were sometimes used when recording meetings at work based on the situation-specific method.\\n\\nAudio\\n\\nEach conversant hung an IC recorder, a SONY ICD\u2013SX734, around their neck, and their voice was recorded with their own recorder.

Structure of the CEJC\\n\\nThe whole corpus contains video and audio data, transcripts, and two types of POS annotations. There is a subset of the corpus, named the Core dataset, which consists of 20 hours of conversations, corresponding to 10% of the entire corpus.

The video files were handled as follows: (1) The faces of the main conversants who agreed to have their faces published were left unblurred. (2) The faces of third parties performing common activities that were not sensitive activities and in public places were regarded as outside the scope of protection of portrait rights and were left unblurred. (3) The faces of third parties who are interpreted as being inside the scope of protection of portrait rights were airbrushed. (4) The faces of third parties talking to the...\"}"}

ISO 24617-2 includes communicative functions and functional dependence relations. Information about communicative function is divided into two types: semantic/pragmatic-level tags (e.g., question, answer, attention getting, and thanking) and interactional-level tags (e.g., repair, opening, and closing) in our framework.\\n\\nIntonation labels\\nThe utterances of 152 of the 157 main conversants included in the Core, which were selected on the basis of recording conditions and degrees of dialect and recording conditions, were manually labeled according to a simplified version of the intonation-labeling scheme, X\u2013JToBI (Maekawa et al., 2002), which was developed for spontaneous Japanese speech included in the CSJ. Figure 5 shows a sample labeling of a simplified version of X\u2013JToBI.\\n\\n3. Evaluation of CEJC\\nThe CEJC contains 200 hours of speech, 461 sessions, 577 conversations, about 2.4 million words (short-unit words, see above), and a total of 1675 conversants, including 862 different participants.\\n\\nIn this section, we will evaluate whether the CEJC is balanced in terms of conversant and conversation attributes.\\n\\n3.1. Conversant attributes\\nFigure 6 shows the distributions of numbers of conversants and words by gender and age included in the CEJC. In the individual-based method that is the main recording method of the CEJC, since the informant over 20 years old shown in Table 2 recorded conversations mainly with their friends, colleagues, and family members, many conversants of the same generation as the informant are naturally included in the corpus. Figure 6 shows that although there are some differences, such as a small number of males in their 40s and 50s, and many females in their 30s, 40s, and 50s, the CEJC contains about 100 or more conversants and more than 150,000 words for both males and females of all generations over 20 years of age. Since a preliminary survey of about 100 hours of conversations recorded using the individual-based method showed that there were few children under 20 years of age in the data, we also recorded, using the situation-specific method, about five hours of conversations by junior high and high school students. However, the figure shows that the conversations of minors are far fewer than those of adults of all ages.\\n\\n3.2. Conversation attributes\\nOne of the main features of the CEJC is that it contains various kinds of everyday conversation in a balanced manner. To establish a corpus design for such a balanced corpus, we conducted a survey of everyday conversational behavior with about 250 adults in order to show the diversity of our everyday conversational behavior (Koiso et al., 2016b). The questionnaire included when, where, how long, with whom, and in what kind of activity informants were engaged in conversation. On the basis of the results, we derived the approximate distributions of conversation forms, conversation places, accompanying activities, and the number of conversants included in each conversation as a measure of the design of a balanced corpus. In this section, we compare the conversations included in the CEJC with the survey results.\\n\\nFigures 7 and 8 show comparisons between the CEJC and the survey results in terms of conversation forms, conversation places, accompanying activities, and the number of conversants in each conversation.

Conversation form Figure 7 shows that there are slight differences in that the ratio of the number of chats in the CEJC is higher than that in the survey, while the ratio of the number of consultation/business talks is lower, although Figure 8 indicates that the CEJC shows similar tendencies to the survey in terms of total duration. This difference comes from the fact that the survey included more short consultations/business talks of less than five minutes than the CEJC did. Although there is only a slight difference, it can be said that, with regard to conversation forms, the CEJC contains conversations in a balanced manner with reference to the survey results.\\n\\nPlace and Activity\\nThe distributions of places and activities differ between the CEJC and the survey as follows: (1) the CEJC includes more conversations in public and commercial facilities and indoors, such as restaurants, city halls, friends' houses, and parents' houses, and fewer conversations at home, at school, and in the workplace than the survey; (2) the CEJC contains more conversations during private activities, such as spending time with family and friends, while\"}"}

As mentioned in Section 2.1, by verifying the balance of the 94 hours of conversations collected using the individual-based method in the middle of building the CEJC, we also collected 15 hours of business meetings and conversations by minors using the situation-specific method. The augmentation of data significantly reduced the gap between the survey and CEJC, but not to the same extent.\\n\\nThe reasons why there are fewer conversations at home in the CEJC, even though informants recorded many conversations at home, are as follows. As reported by Koiso et al. (2018), we decided to include fewer conversations at home in the CEJC than in the survey to reduce the similar types of conversation, such as conversations while eating with a family member at home, and to ensure a variety of conversations.\\n\\nNumber of conversants in each conversation\\n\\nIn Figure 7, the proportions of the number of conversants in each conversation show similar tendencies for the CEJC and the survey. However, differences can be seen in Figure 8. The total duration of conversations among five or more people is shorter in the CEJC than in the survey. This difference arises from the criteria of data collection for the CEJC. Although Koiso et al. (2016b) showed that conversations of five or more conversants tend to be long conversations over one hour, we asked informants to record at most an hour of conversation in order to collect many kinds of conversation for the CEJC.\\n\\n4. Conclusions\\n\\nIn this paper, we first provided an overview of the corpus of the CEJC, including the recording method and devices, structure of the corpus, formats of video and audio files, transcription, and annotations. Next, we reported some results of the evaluation of the CEJC in terms of conversant and conversation attributes. We showed that the CEJC contains a good balance between adult conversants in terms of gender and age. On the other hand, it was also shown that the CEJC includes fewer children than adults. To correct for this bias, we plan to start a new project in April 2022, in which we will build a corpus whose main targets are children. As for conversational attributes, we evaluated the balance of the CEJC by comparing it with a survey of everyday conversational behavior. Although we found fewer conversations during work/schoolwork at workplaces/schools in the CEJC than in the survey, we showed that the CEJC contains a variety of conversations in terms of conversation forms, conversation places, and accompanying activities, as well as number of conversants.\\n\\nThe CEJC will be published in March 2022 in two ways: 1) a web-based search system accessible to two-way POS data, provided free of charge, and 2) the entire corpus, including audio/video data and all annotation, provided for a fee.\\n\\n5.
