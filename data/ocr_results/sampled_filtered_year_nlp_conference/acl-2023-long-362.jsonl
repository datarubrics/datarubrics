Specifically, these agents must infer personas of their listeners to produce statements that cater to their interests. They must also learn to maintain consistent speaker personas for themselves throughout the narrative, so that their counterparts feel involved in a realistic conversation or story.\\n\\nHowever, personas are diverse and complex: they entail large quantities of rich interconnected world knowledge that is challenging to robustly represent in general narrative systems (e.g., a singer is good at singing, and may have attended conservatoire). In this work, we construct a new large-scale persona commonsense knowledge graph, PEACOK, containing \\\\( \\\\sim 100K \\\\) human-validated persona facts. Our knowledge graph schematizes five dimensions of persona knowledge identified in previous studies of human interactive behaviours, and distils facts in this schema from both existing commonsense knowledge graphs and large-scale pretrained language models. Our analysis indicates that PEACOK contains rich and precise world persona inferences that help downstream systems generate more consistent and engaging narratives.\\n\\n1 Introduction\\n\\nInterlocutors or storytellers in narrative scenarios often exhibit varying behaviours, which are affected by their own diverse personas, but also the personas of the counterparts they are interacting with. For example, an adventurous architect may be interested in talking about outdoor explorations with his friends who have similar hobbies, but may prefer to discuss architectural design ideas with his colleagues at work. Narrative systems must know when such behaviours should be exhibited, requiring them to learn and represent the rich personas of characters based on self-introductions, biographies and other background profiles.\\n\\nThis goal of modeling diverse persona attributes is at the heart of research in the areas of persona-grounded dialogue (Zhang et al., 2018; Zhong et al., 2020; Xu et al., 2022), story generation (Chandu et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2022) and narrative understanding (Brahman et al., 2021). However, the complex nature of real-world personas, which involve rich world knowledge, and the countless ways in which they might interact, is challenging to reliably learn purely from data. For instance, as shown in Figure 1, a singer preparing an album may have studied music at university at one point, which would allow them to share their experience with a student majoring in composition, who may study music as a daily routine.\\n\\nPrior work takes first steps at improving the persona knowledge representations available in narrative systems.

However, their collected profiles are fragmented and ignore the interconnections between personas that govern interactions. Meanwhile, Majumder et al., 2020 use knowledge generators (Bosselut et al., 2019) to expand the persona profiles with commonsense inferences, but these commonsense expansions are limited to general social commonsense (Hwang et al., 2021), and do not form a systematic persona-centric knowledge frame. Consequently, the lack of world-level persona commonsense knowledge resource hinders progress in learning the systematic persona representations necessary to sustain consistent and engaging narratives.\\n\\nIn this work, we propose a Persona-grounded Commonsense Knowledge graph (P-EA-CO-K), which represents world-level persona knowledge at scale. Building off the persona concept initially proposed in human-computer interaction (Cooper, 1999; Mulder and Yaar, 2006; Cooper et al., 2007) and on behavior analysis literature for human leisure conversations (Dunbar et al., 1997), we define a persona frame that formalizes five common aspects of persona knowledge: characteristics, routines and habits, goals and plans, experiences, and relationships. Using this knowledge frame, we construct a large-scale graph of persona commonsense knowledge by extracting and generating persona knowledge from both existing hand-crafted commonsense KGs and large-scale pretrained language models (LMs). We validate the knowledge graph via a joint human-AI majority voting scheme that integrates large pretrained LMs into the loop of crowdsourcing, and efficiently mediates the disagreements between human annotators.\\n\\nOur resulting KG, P-EA-CO-K contains \u223c100K high-quality commonsense inferences (i.e., facts) about personas whose connectivity in the KG reveals countless opportunities to discover common ground between personas. A neural extrapolation from the KG (Hwang et al., 2021) also shows that P-EA-CO-K\u2019s annotated personas enable the development of effective persona inference generators. Finally, the extended knowledge provided by P-EA-CO-K enables a downstream persona-grounded dialogue system to generate more consistent and engaging responses in conversations, particularly when more interconnections between the interlocutor personas are found in P-EA-CO-K.\\n\\n### 2 Related Work\\n\\n#### Commonsense Knowledge Graphs\\n\\nCommonsense KGs such as ConceptNet (Liu and Singh, 2004; Speer et al., 2017), ATOMIC (Sap et al., 2019a), ANION (Jiang et al., 2021) and ATOMIC2020 (Hwang et al., 2021) are widely used in NLP applications that involve integrating implicit world knowledge, e.g., question answering (Talmor et al., 2019; Sap et al., 2019b; Chang et al., 2020; Shwartz et al., 2020) and text generation (Lin et al., 2020). However, despite the importance of persona knowledge in modeling human behavior \u2014 a crucial component for building reliable narrative systems (Zhang et al., 2018; Chandu et al., 2019) \u2014 no commonsense KG explicitly focuses on representing human persona knowledge. We present P-EA-CO-K to open the field of developing commonsense knowledge graphs around personas.\\n\\n#### Persona-Grounded Narratives\\n\\nIntegrating personas to improve consistency and engagement of narratives is an important goal in dialogue (Song et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020) and storytelling (Chandu et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2022) systems. One representative work that greatly contributed to the development of faithful persona emulation, PERSONA-CHAT (Zhang et al., 2018), constructs a crowdsourced dialogue dataset by asking participants to perform conversations based on their assigned persona profiles \u2014 five statements of self-introduction. More recent work improves persona modeling in narrative systems by generating persona profiles from online resources (Mazare et al., 2018), training persona detectors (Gu et al., 2021) and predictors (Zhou et al., 2021), and distilling persona knowledge from commonsense inference engines (Majumder et al., 2020). However, while these works align characters in narratives with persona profiles, they only implicitly model the areas of interaction between personas. In contrast, P-EA-CO-K explicitly represents interconnections between persona profiles, enabling persona interaction modeling in narrative systems.\\n\\n### 3 P-EA-CO-K Knowledge Frame\\n\\nTo construct a systematic representation of persona knowledge, we distill five common aspects of personas from classical persona definitions.

From the perspective of goal-directed design (Cooper, 1999; Cooper et al., 2007), personas encapsulate user needs and goals when interacting with a product, along with their intrinsic character traits and past experiences (Randolph, 2004) that contextualize the interaction. Using these attributes of goals, traits, and experiences as the foundation of personas, we also leverage prior studies in human conversational behaviour that explore which topics of conversation are often broached in relaxed human social interactions. After conducting observational studies, Dunbar et al. (1997) categorized the topics of human conversations into bins: personal relationships (i.e., experiences or emotions rising from social interactions), personal experiences (i.e., factual events or circumstances experienced by a person), future activities (i.e., arrangements of meetings or events), leisure activities (e.g., hobbies), interests (e.g., culture, politics, religion), and work (e.g., daily routines).\\n\\nTo select our persona dimensions, we discard certain controversial categories from the above studies (i.e., culture, politics, and religion), as well as temporary dimensions of persona (i.e., emotion, which is well covered by prior work; Gupta et al., 2017; Chatterjee et al., 2019; Rashkin et al., 2019). Our final persona frame consists of five relations for each persona, each with multiple attributes attached to it. We describe the five relations below:\\n\\nCharacteristics describe an intrinsic trait, e.g., a quality or a mental state, that the persona likely exhibits. For example, as shown in Figure 1, good at singing describes a talent of a singer, which is one of the singer's characteristics.\\n\\nRoutines or Habits describe an extrinsic behaviour that the persona does on a regular basis, e.g., a singer may regularly write songs.\\n\\nGoals or Plans describe an extrinsic action or outcome that the persona wants to accomplish or do in the future, e.g., a singer may aim to win a Grammy award some day.\\n\\nExperiences describe extrinsic events or activities that the persona did in the past. For instance, a singer may have studied music at college.\\n\\nRelationships encode likely interactions of the persona with other people or social groups. Note that this relation can be overlapped with other relations in PEOCOK. For example, a singer may want to have more fans, which connotes a relationship between singer and fans, but also a future goal or plan of singer.\\n\\n4 PEOCOK Construction\\nWe use our persona frames to construct a knowledge graph of persona commonsense where personas are treated as head entities in the graph, frame relations constitute edge type relations, and attributes are tails in a (head, relation, tail) structure. Then, we devise a three-step procedure to construct the frames that make up PEOCOK, as shown in Figure 2. First, we search existing commonsense KGs to select entities that can serve as head personas. Then we query these KGs and prompt pretrained LMs to collect tail attributes that are potentially associated with the personas via the five relations defined in Sec. 3. Finally, we use crowdsourcing with large LMs in the loop to classify whether these persona inferences are valid.\\n\\n4.1 Persona Selection\\nWe select entities that can represent head personas using ATOMIC 20 (Hwang et al., 2021), a common-\"}"}

We assume that entities related to personas should be about human beings, rather than other animals or non-living objects. Therefore, we first over-sample living entities from ATOMIC20 which have animated behaviours, by extracting head entities that possess the CapableOf relation (i.e., are capable of doing something), e.g., an actor who is capable of performing, as shown in Figure 2. Then we filter out non-human beings in our extracted living entities, by removing entities that appear in the Animal Appendix of Wiktionary. We also manually filter out other inappropriate entities which are too generic (e.g., man) or unrealistic (e.g., devil).\\n\\nThis initial procedure provides us with a diverse collection of initial coarse personas (e.g., actor, singer). To enlarge our persona set with fine-grained personas (e.g., actor who acts in movies vs. actor who acts in plays), we collect additional persona candidates using three types of event-based entities derived from our initial persona set: a) entities containing the initial persona in a more complex context, e.g., becomes an actor associates with the process of becoming an actor, rather than being an actor, b) entities that can be linked to the initial persona through the ATOMIC20 CapableOf relation, e.g., acts in play is linked to actor, and c) entities that are returned by Sentence-BERT retrieval (Reimers and Gurevych, 2019) for the initial persona, e.g., becomes a movie star. For the later two types of derived event-based entities, we prompt InstructGPT-3 (Ouyang et al., 2022) to filter out extended personas which do not entail their initial seed persona, e.g., wants to be a lawyer is not entailed by a is a judge, as X would already be a lawyer if they were a judge. Finally, we extract 3.8K personas, which are converted to persona statements and integrated in PEACO3.\\n\\n4.2 Attribute Induction\\n\\nWe derive the attribute knowledge for our collected set of head personas using both hand-crafted KGs and large language models pretrained on natural language corpora (which contain many narratives with implied persona information).\\n\\n| Persona | Relation | Attribute |\\n|---------|----------|-----------|\\n| I am a programmer who becomes an expert | Characteristic, Self, Distinctive | tech savvy and highly knowledgeable in coding |\\n| I am a waiter | Routine or Habit, Relationship, Distinctive | get tips from customers |\\n| I am a runner who runs track | Goal or Plan, Self, Generic | get better |\\n| I am a great basketball player | Experience, Relationship, Distinctive | played on the varsity basketball team in high school |\\n\\nTable 1: Example persona attributes from PEACO3.\\n\\nKG-Based Approach\\n\\nWe first select 10 commonsense relations in ATOMIC20 KG which are potentially related to persona knowledge. For each persona entity selected in Sec. 4.1, we extract potential attributes by taking 1-hop inferences of the persona along one of our selected ATOMIC20 relations. As ATOMIC20 may have a limited coverage of commonsense knowledge, we also use a knowledge model, COMET (Bosselut et al., 2019), pretrained on ATOMIC20, to generate potential attributes of each persona as well. We append each selected ATOMIC20 relation to the persona entity, and feed each persona-relation pair to COMET to generate 5 new potential attributes.\\n\\nLM-Based Approach\\n\\nTo mine more persona knowledge implied in natural language corpora, we also prompt InstructGPT-3 to generate new persona attributes. Using each of the five relations defined in Sec. 3, we prompt InstructGPT-3 with our persona statements and generate 5 new attributes for each relation. For example, for the Experience relation, we instruct the model to guess distinctive activities that an individual fitting the persona might have done in the past. We adapt InstructGPT-3 using 5 manually created in-context examples for each type of relation.\\n\\n4.3 Relation Classification\\n\\nOnce we have a large-set of initial candidate knowledge tuples to compose our persona frames, we use crowdworkers from Amazon Mechanical Turk to verify every collected relationship consisting of a head persona, relation, and tail attribute.

For each attribute, we independently ask two workers to judge whether it describes: a) an intrinsic or extrinsic feature of the persona, b) a one-off or regular attribute of the persona, c) a past, present or future attribute of the persona, d) an attribute of only the persona itself, or describing the persona's relationship with others (interactivity). Finally, for each attribute in the persona frame, we ask workers whether the attribute is distinctively associated with the persona or generically associated with many potential personas (distinctiveness). As an example, in Table 1, we see that get tips from customers is distinctively associated as a common routine of a waiter. Meanwhile, get better is a generic attribute that would not be strongly associated with runner, as many personas can have the goal of self-improvement.\\n\\nWe follow Figure 3 to map the first three dimensions of the feature labels to one of the first four relations defined in Sec. 3, which we define as the main relation label of each persona-attribute pair. The other two dimensions of feature labels, i.e., interactivity (containing the fifth relation in Sec. 3) and distinctiveness, are defined as two additional relation labels. If a worker judges that an attribute is not associated with the persona at all, we instead ask the worker to label the relation as Not Persona.\\n\\nMajority Voting with LM in the Loop\\nTo mediate the disagreements between two crowdworkers without introducing more human labour (i.e., a third worker), we use InstructGPT-3 and the two workers in a majority vote scheme to determine the final relation labels of some persona-attribute mappings. For each attribute collected in Sec. 4.2, we prompt InstructGPT-3 to produce additional labels for the relation of the attribute with respect to the persona. We prompt InstructGPT-3 on three labels for each relation: a) the main relation label, b) the interactivity label, and c) the distinctiveness label. For the main dimension, we set the labeling classes to include the four main relation labels, and also a negative class (No Persona) indicating that the attribute is not a persona attribute or too generic (e.g., living a happy life). We prompt InstructGPT-3 with 2 examples of each class for the main dimension (i.e., 10 manually labeled in-context examples). For the interactivity and distinctiveness dimensions, we ask InstructGPT-3 to predict a binary label for each dimension. For these predictions, we provide InstructGPT-3 with 4 examples of each class (i.e., 8 manually labeled in-context examples for each dimension).\\n\\nFor each dimension of the relation labeling schema shown in Figure 3, we determine the final label as the majority label given by InstructGPT-3 and the two workers. We set the final label as Controversial if no unique majority label is found, e.g., InstructGPT-3 and two workers all give different labels. Finally, each persona-attribute pair forms a persona fact triple with its annotated relation labels in PEACOK. Table 1 shows some examples of PEACOK facts.\\n\\nWe include our designed instruction and few-shot examples for InstructGPT-3 relation labeling in Appendix A. We list more PEACOK persona facts in Appendix B.\"}"}

Percentage values in parentheses are computed among cases where there is disagreement between the two workers.\\n\\nOur statistics of the final PEA COK relations are shown in Table 2, where we construct 102,097 facts with valid persona knowledge inferences. We stratify PEA COK statistics based on the two persona collection approaches (KG-based and LM-based) described in Sec. 4.2. We find that the KG-based distillation (which extracts information initially annotated by human workers) results in more imbalanced persona knowledge. A large proportion (\u223c57%) of Routine or Habit relations dominate the extracted persona relations, and there are fewer Relationship and Distinctive facts, as well. This indicates that hand-crafted social commonsense KGs contain a narrower view of real-world persona knowledge, highlighting the importance of also distilling a balanced set of persona knowledge from large pretrained LMs. However, the repurposed knowledge from the KG was initially written by humans, and contains diverse persona inferences less likely to be generated by LLMs.\\n\\n**Persona Interconnectivity**\\nIn addition to containing diverse knowledge from multiple sources, PEA COK also contains interesting interconnections among personas, which potentially indicate engaging points of common ground for characters of narratives. For example, as shown in Figure 1, a professional singer's experience of studying music at college is also the routine of a music-major student, which shows a common topic for these two persona to discuss. Among 40,665 distinctive attributes in PEA COK, we find that 9,242 attributes are connected to two or more personas, forming 239,812 bridges, i.e., pairs of personas connected via a shared common attribute.\\n\\n5.1 Attribute Disagreements\\nOne of our innovations in this work is to introduce InstructGPT-3 as a third annotator to resolve disagreements between human annotators via majority voting. We analyze the disagreements between workers across the annotations as in Table 3, and observe that labels from InstructGPT-3 effectively solve many disagreements between human workers. For the main dimension labeling, \u223c73% of the disagreements are solved by adding InstructGPT-3 as a third annotator. However, \u223c27% of labels remain Controversial when both annotators and GPT3 all disagree in different ways. These controversial labels enable further research on the ambiguities in real-world persona types and the potential stereotypes in persona judgments. In the interactivity and distinctiveness dimensions where the labeling schema is binary, disagreements of workers are fully solved by the majority voting with InstructGPT-3, though ambiguous cases may still remain.\\n\\n**Expert Study**\\nHowever, one question that naturally arises, when employing a majority voting with InstructGPT-3 in the loop, is whether this classification decision remains accurate. To evaluate this, two experts from our research group manually re-annotate the relations of 825 persona facts...\"}"}

The 825 persona facts consist of 275 samples from each of the three PAEK subsets where majority voting is employed, that is, when InstructGPT-3 agrees with one of the workers but not the other, and when both workers agree with each other but not with InstructGPT-3. Experts are required to pass a qualification test by performing 20 test annotations correctly. Furthermore, in the case of disagreements (7% of cases), a third expert re-checked the annotations of the two experts and resolved the disagreement cases.\\n\\nTable 4 presents the accuracy and F1 of the majority voting results, compared to the re-annotations from experts as ground truth labels. We stratify the results into two cases: the two workers disagree with each other but InstructGPT-3 agrees with one of them, and both workers agree with each other but not with InstructGPT-3. We observe a high agreement between the experts and the majority vote, with an average accuracy and F1 of 0.874 and 0.865, respectively. These results validate majority voting with InstructGPT-3 in the loop, showing that InstructGPT-3 serves as a reliable third annotator when disagreements arise. Moreover, the integration of InstructGPT-3 in the verification loop costs less in terms of time and money compared to adding more human annotators.\\n\\nHowever, we note that InstructGPT-3 is not a panacea on its own. While the model effectively resolves worker disagreements, we find that its individual predictions are only correct with \\\\(\\\\sim 60\\\\%\\\\) macro-F1, which is far from the \\\\(\\\\sim 85\\\\%\\\\) macro-F1 with majority voting, indicating that not all PAEK persona relations are known by large-scale language models, and that human crowdsourcing is still necessary to ensure data quality.\\n\\nGeneralizing Persona Knowledge\\nFollowing the neural KG analysis method proposed by Hwang et al., 2021, we assess whether PAEK could be used to train inference generators that hypothesize persona knowledge. We train a BART-based (Lewis et al., 2020) COMET-BART knowledge generator based on a held-out training set (\\\\(\\\\sim 65K\\\\) facts) of PAEK, where the model learns to generate the tail attribute of a fact given its head persona and relation. We evaluate COMET-BART on a test set from PAEK containing 3030 facts with unique head-relation combinations. As baselines, we compare to a few-shot GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) that uses 5 randomly sampled training facts (with same relation as the testing fact) to prompt the tail knowledge generation and a zero-shot GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) baseline model. These baselines compare PAEK training to larger LMs that use both in context-learning and instruction tuning. We conduct both automatic and human evaluations on the knowledge generators, with results shown in Tables 5 and 6.\\n\\nCompared to few-shot GPT-3, COMET-BART trained on PAEK achieves overall better automatic evaluation results on various NLG metrics, despite being a much smaller model.\\n\\nIn the human evaluation, we find that facts generated by COMET-BART receive a high acceptance rate by experts. We include more implementation details of our neural KG analysis in Appendix C.\"}"}

Ties are not shown.\\n\\nEnhancing Dialogue Systems\\n\\nAs our knowledge graph $P_E A_C O_K$ covers rich world persona knowledge, we validate whether access to this knowledge enables better persona modeling in downstream narrative systems. Using $P_E A_C O_K$, we augment a persona-grounded dialogue model $P_2B$ (Liu et al., 2020) developed on the ConvAI2 (Dinan et al., 2020) PERSONA-CHAT (Zhang et al., 2018) dataset. We link facts from $P_E A_C O_K$ to PERSONA-CHAT dialogues, thereby extending $P_2B$'s persona perception and augmenting its dialogue response generation.\\n\\nWe evaluate our models based on both original and revised interlocutor profiles provided in the ConvAI2 PERSONA-CHAT dataset, and measure the perplexity ($PPL$), word-level $F1$, and cumulative 4-gram $BLEU$ (Papineni et al., 2002) of the generated responses compared to the references. We also follow ConvAI2 to measure $Hits@1$, i.e., the probability that real response is ranked the highest by the model among 20 candidates.\\n\\nResults\\n\\nIn Table 7, we show that $P_2B + P_E A_C O_K$ significantly outperforms $P_2B$ on $PPL$. Due to the model capacity limitation of the baseline $P_2B$, we only sample a subset of linked $P_E A_C O_K$ facts as the extended persona knowledge for each interlocutor.\\n\\nFact preprocessing details are in Appendix C and D.\\n\\nPersonata Knowledge Linking\\n\\nWe link $P_E A_C O_K$ knowledge to interlocutors based on both their PERSONA-CHAT profiles and their utterances in the dialogue. For each interlocutor, we extract all statements in their profile, as well as first-person sentences in their utterances. Then, we follow a commonsense fact linking benchmark, $CO-MET$ (Gao et al., 2022), to link relevant facts from $P_E A_C O_K$ to each extracted statement or sentence. We remove linked facts that are labeled as $Generic$ in the distinctiveness dimension, i.e., have little effect on distinguishing this persona from others. For each interlocutor, we randomly sample 5 $P_E A_C O_K$ facts that are linked to their PERSONA-CHAT profile, and convert them into natural language statements to form their extended persona knowledge.\\n\\nOur augmented model is denoted as $P_2B + P_E A_C O_K$. To compare $P_E A_C O_K$'s persona-centric knowledge augmentations with general commonsense augmentations, we also evaluate another baseline model $P_2B + ATOMIC 2020$, where we follow Majumder et al., 2020 to extend interlocutor personas with 5 randomly sampled commonsense inferences from the $COMET-A_TOMIC 2020$ model (Hwang et al., 2021).\"}"}
{"id": "acl-2023-long-362", "page_num": 9, "content": "{\"primary_language\":\"en\",\"is_rotation_valid\":true,\"rotation_correction\":0,\"is_table\":false,\"is_diagram\":false,\"natural_text\":\"and hits@1,15 and has comparable F1 and BLEU scores. Compared to P2BOT + ATOMIC 20, P2BOT + PEACOK also demonstrates a clear improvement across all metrics, indicating the importance of augmenting narrative systems with persona-grounded commonsense knowledge.\\n\\nHuman Evaluation\\nAutomatic metrics are not fully reliable for evaluating dialogue systems (Liu et al., 2016; Novikova et al., 2017), so we also conduct human evaluations on the dialogue responses. We make pairwise comparisons between P2BOT + PEACOK and other baseline models, based on their generated responses to 200 randomly sampled dialogue histories (100 each with original and revised PERSONA-CHEAT profiles). Two expert annotators from our research group manually compare four aspects of the response generation quality: fluency, whether the response is fluent and understandable; consistency, where the response is consistent with the dialogue history; engagement, whether the response is engaging and interesting; persona expression, whether the response demonstrates persona information related to the interlocutor's profile. To ensure the fairness and reliability of our human evaluation, similar to Sec. 5.1, we require each expert to pass a qualification test on 10 pairwise comparisons, and also include a third qualified expert to re-check the evaluation results. We note that both expert annotators do not see the source model from which each response is generated. The human evaluation results in Table 8 show that P2BOT + PEACOK generates more consistent and engaging dialogues compared to other neural baselines, demonstrating that persona commonsense knowledge is a key contributor to the conversation consistency and engagement. However, P2BOT + PEACOK still has room for improvement compared to human performance.\\n\\nPerhaps most interestingly, though, we find that PEACOK's impact on the consistency and engagement of dialogues is most pronounced when there are interconnections between the personas of the interlocutors. We stratify the pairwise comparison between P2BOT + PEACOK versus P2BOT from Table 8 based on the overlap of the two interlocutors' linked PEACOK knowledge. In Table 9, we show the results of this stratification across the cases where the interlocutors have 0, 1 or more than 1 shared attributes. Specifically, we find that the winning rates of P2BOT w/ PEACOK on dialogue consistency and engagement increase as the overlap of the two speakers' linked PEACOK personas becomes larger, demonstrating that more connections between interlocutors leads to more consistent and engaging conversations, and highlighting the importance of learning interconnected world persona knowledge in narratives.\\n\\n8 Conclusion\\nIn this work, we propose a persona commonsense knowledge graph, PEACOK, to complement the real-world picture of personas that ground consistent and engaging narratives. PEACOK consists of \u223c100K persona commonsense inferences, distilled from existing KGs and pretrained LMs, across five dimensions of persona knowledge identified in prior literature on human interactive behaviours. Our analysis and experiments demonstrate that PEACOK contains high-quality inferences whose connectivity provides many instances of common ground between personas, improving the consistency and engagement of downstream narrative systems.\\n\\nLimitations\\nWe acknowledge a few limitations in this work. First, PEACOK cannot be comprehensive. Persona knowledge is very broad and our resource cannot cover all dimensions of personas, nor all attributes of these dimensions. We select five dimensions of personas that we found salient from background literature in human interaction, and we distill attributes for these dimensions from ATOMIC and COMET and InstructGPT-3. These resources, while rich in knowledge, only represent a subset of possible background resources for the construction of PEACOK, and further work is needed to expand and improve the quality of our resource.\"}"}

Furthermore, the primary language of these three resources is English, making PEA-CO a solely English resource. Finally, in downstream narrative experiments, the usage of our augmented persona knowledge is constrained by the capacity of baseline model, which leaves for future work the exploration of downstream persona knowledge augmentation on a larger scale.\\n\\nEthics Statement\\n\\nOur work is approved by our institution\u2019s human research ethics committee to conduct human-centric or ethics-related experiments, e.g., crowdsourcing and human evaluations. Topic-wise, our research develops a knowledge graph of commonsense knowledge about personas to augment understanding of characters and their interactions in diverse narratives. Given that some of the attributes are extracted from previous KGs or generated by LMs, we cannot guarantee our knowledge graph does not contain attribute alignments with negative connotations that could provide undesired information to a downstream system. However, we took the following steps to mitigate this effect. First, the set of personas we include in PEA-CO was manually filtered to not include stereotypical and harmful roles, thereby limiting the negative associations of the personas themselves. Second, we explicitly prompted the LM to generate optimistic attributes about personas, which has been shown in prior work to reduce the toxicity of outputs (Schick et al., 2021). Finally, each attribute in PEA-CO is explicitly validated by two human workers for toxicity, providing a final opportunity for workers to flag problematic content. However, we acknowledge that none of these safeguards are perfect, as language models may still produce toxic outputs and annotators may have differing opinions on what constitutes toxic content (Sap et al., 2022).\\n\\nAcknowledgements\\n\\nWe thank Gail Weiss, Syrielle Montariol, Graciana Aad and Mete Ismayil for reading and providing comments on drafts of this paper.

We train the DeBERTa model to discriminate true facts versus negative samples based on a binary classification loss, with hyperparameters suggested by the ComFact (Gao et al., 2022) benchmark. Four NVIDIA TITAN X Pascal GPUs are used to train the model for 6 epochs, which costs about 21 hours to get the highest F1 score on the validation set.

We use the DeBERTa entity linker (instead of fact linker) to check the relevance of each fact's head and tail personas independently, without considering their in-between relations. This is because the DeBERTa fact linker from COMFACT is trained on ATOMIC2020 relations, which cannot well identify the new relation sets of PERSONA-COK. We link persona facts from PERSONA-COK whose head and tail personas are both relevant to the extracted PERSONA-CHAT statement or sentence. We also include an additional set of persona facts which only have relevant tail personas, since the high-level head personas are not always revealed in the dialogue.

We find that the involved PEAOK fact help identify a potential role of the speaker, i.e., breeder inferred from milking cows and farmland, and also explain the speaker's persona of having a pet canine, i.e., dog. Therefore, compared to other baseline models, P2BOT w/ PEAOK generates a more consistent and engaging response, which is well associated with the counterpart's last utterance in the dialogue history, and also simultaneously conveys a related persona of the speaker.\"}"}
