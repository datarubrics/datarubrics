We give an overview of the comparable and parallel, aligned corpus variants and explore various applications of the corpus. What makes EPIC UdS relevant is that it is one of the rare interpreting corpora that includes transcripts suitable for research on more than one language pair and on interpreting with regard to German. It not only contains transcribed speeches, but also rich metadata and fine-grained linguistic annotations tailored for diverse applications across a broad range of linguistic subfields.\\n\\nKeywords: Simultaneous interpreting corpus, European Parliament data, multilingual language resource, corpus annotation\\n\\n1. Introduction\\nThe European Parliament (EP) has been described as \\\"one of the most promising sources of interpreting and intermodal corpora\\\" for European languages due to the availability, accessibility and controlability of data and the professional interpreter status (Bernardini et al., 2018). Various interpreting corpus projects make use of this rich data source for interpreted speech. At the same time, the EP is a rather specific interpreting setting. EU interpreters work against the backdrop of extreme multilingualism in large meetings (Graves et al., 2021) and the EP context is not necessarily entirely representative for all interpreting services provided in the EU.\\n\\nDue to the generally time-consuming nature of spoken language corpora compilation, simultaneous interpreting corpora are still rare. They exist for a restricted set of language combinations, and most of them can be classified as nano-corpora (Defrancq, 2018). New interpreting corpora are currently being compiled with different goals and users in mind, and thus with varying transcription levels, meta-data attributes and with different degrees of availability. These corpus projects are highly relevant as interpretese still remains a largely understudies phenomenon. We briefly discuss a non-exhaustive list of examples in this paper (Section 2).\\n\\nUsing the standards established for existing resources, the EPIC UdS (European Parliament Interpreting Corpus at Saarland University) project was designed in a way that its transcriptions can be used in combination with data available within previously compiled EPIC corpora for other language combinations (cf. Section 3.2). Furthermore, we provide various corpus variants that can be used for different research foci, e.g. one corpus variant including disfluencies such as filled and silent pauses for studying cognitive aspects of interpreting vs. a \\\"cleaned\\\" corpus variant without disfluencies enabling more accurate linguistic annotations needed for research on specific lexical and syntactic features.\\n\\nThe remainder of the paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, we provide an overview of other existing interpreting corpora and discuss related work. Section 3 describes procedures of data collection, transcription and annotation. In Section 4, we present the existing corpus variants. Possible applications are discussed in Section 5. We conclude with a summary and outlook in Section 6.\\n\\n2. Related Work\\n2.1. Existing Corpora\\nThe EPIC UdS corpus can be situated in the European Parliament Interpreting family of corpora which was initiated with EPIC, created at Bologna university for Italian, English and Spanish (Russo et al., 2005). Other EP corpora include EPICG, covering English, French, Dutch and Spanish (Defrancq et al., 2015), PINC for Polish and English (Chmiel et al., 2021) as well as EP interpreting corpora efforts in Belgrade, Louvain and Lisbon (Bernardini et al., 2018). Recently, the corpus ESIC has been released with EP speeches in English and simultaneous interpreting into Czech and German (Mach\u00e1\u010dek et al., 2021). The various European Parliament interpreting corpora mainly differ with regard to the languages covered, selection of interpreter status (interpreting into assumed native language e.g. EPIC, EPICG and EPIC UdS, or including \\\"return\\\" for PINC) and transcription post-processing such as time-alignment for EPICG with EXMARaLDA or sentence alignment for EPIC as well as the sentence aligned and dependency parsed variants for EPIC UdS. EPIC UdS adds German (as an additional widely used language...\"}"}

Beside the aforementioned EPIC family of corpora, SIREN (Dayter, 2018), an English-Russian corpus of speeches and interpretations held at the United Nations and CEPIC (Pan, 2019), a large-scale (6.5 mio tokens) Chinese-English corpus, can also be placed in the political context.\\n\\nInterpreting corpora that include texts from other genres and domains include the DIRSI-C, a parallel, aligned corpus of English-Italian transcripts of international conferences, following the same methodology as the EPIC family (Bendazzoli, 2010), the WAW corpus in Arabic and English also with texts from international conferences (Temnikova et al., 2017) and HeiCIC, the Heidelberg Conference Interpreting Corpus (Kunz et al., 2021). HeiCIC contains authentic speeches by scientists and experts presenting their research on a variety of topics including electrical engineering in car manufacturing, astronomy, investor relations and annual general meetings of international corporations. These speeches were simultaneously interpreted by learners and professionals in eight languages. The English-German core corpus contains several parallel interpretations by students and professionals with different levels of interpreter expertise. Apart from EPIC UdS and ESIC, HeiCIC is the only other interpreting corpus we are aware of that includes German in its language combinations.\\n\\nFurther corpora that include texts from other genres and domains are NAIST (Doi et al., 2021) and BST (Zhang et al., 2021). The former is an English-Japanese interpreting corpus containing simultaneous interpreting of academic lectures, speeches on everyday topics, press conferences by politicians to business representatives and talks from TED conferences. The latter covers the English-Chinese language pair. It contains speeches and their interpretations involving a wide range of domains, including IT, economy, culture, biology, arts and others.\\n\\n2.2. Studies of Interpreting\\n\\nCorpus-based studies of interpreting often focus on the analysis of interpretese, i.e. specific features of interpreted texts that distinguish them not only from spoken originals but also from written translation ((Sandrelli and Bendazzoli, 2005; Bernardini et al., 2016; Ferrari and Mili\u02c7cevi\u00b4c, 2017) and (Defrancq et al., 2015; Kajzer-Wietrzny, 2012; Dayter, 2018)). Such studies use linguistic patterns to quantitatively and qualitatively analyse the interpretese phenomena in the language corpora at hand.\\n\\nInterpreting corpora are also essential for computational studies of interpretese which use automatically extracted features to automatically tease apart interpreting from other language products. For instance, He et al. (2016) use both shallow surface features and linguistically motivated features such as passive constructions, general nouns, etc. to automatically distinguish between interpreted and translated texts. Bizzoni and Teich (2019) use interpreting and translation corpora to create bilingual word embedding spaces that they explore for differences. Lapshinova-Koltunski (2021) uses a number of hand-crafted features inspired by variational linguistics to automatically classify interpretations and translations, as well as comparable spoken and written non-translations. In a recent study, Lapshinova-Koltunski et al. (2021a) use comparable subcorpora of EPIC and Europarl UdS in a classification task to show that interpreting is the most distinctive type of language production. Moreover, they analysed the translationese and interpretese features in the data and found both general translationese effects and effects that are unique to interpreting and translation, respectively.\\n\\nAnd last but not least, interpreting corpora are used as training and test data for automatic speech translation, where the tasks include simultaneous and offline speech translation, multilingual as well as low-resource speech translation, see proceedings of the series of the International Conference on Spoken Language Translation (IWSLT), such as (Federico et al., 2021; Federico et al., 2020) and previous editions.\\n\\n3. Corpus Compilation\\n\\n3.1. Data Collection\\n\\nAs manual transcription of spoken data is very time-consuming, we used some existing European Parliament transcripts as a starting point for our corpus data: The main part of the English subcorpora \u2013 English spoken originals (EN ORG) and English interpretations with German and Spanish as source (SI DE EN and SI ES EN) \u2013 are taken from TIC (Kajzer-Wietrzny, 2012) and individual English original speeches from EPICG (Defrancq et al., 2015). In order to ensure comparability of data, these existing transcripts were revised, and the newly transcribed dataset for German and Spanish, compiled at Saarland University (UdS), were transcribed according to transcription guidelines based on EPICG (Bernardini et al., 2018).\\n\\nEPIC UdS covers speeches held by MEPs (members of the European Parliament) between 2008 and 2013. Original speakers were selected based on their nationality. Native language was operationalised via speaker's nationality matching the language of the original speech: e.g., if German or Austrian MEPs delivered their speech in German, it was assumed that they are speaking in their native language (Kajzer-Wietrzny, 2015). As for interpreters' native language, the language combinations that are covered in this corpus (DE<>EN and ES<>EN) are generally interpreted from a language which the interpreter understands perfectly or in which the interpreter is perfectly fluent (but into which they do not work) to the interpreter's mother\"}"}

Additionally, for these widely used languages in the EP, usually no relay interpreting via a third \u201cpivot\u201d language is used. A fairly reliable predictor of relay interpreting is Ear-Voice-Span (EVS, the lag time between original speakers utterance and interpreter production) being constantly above four seconds (Bernardini et al., 2018). EPIC UdS is not time-aligned. However, the multilingual videos used for transcription allow for manual validation of EVS not being above four seconds over a longer period of time. We therefore assume that interpreters speak in their native language, interpreting directly from the source language.\\n\\n3.2. Transcription\\n\\nAutomatic speech recognition and transcription to text has advanced hugely during the last years. The focus of such applications is readability and fulfilling written language conventions, and therefore spoken language features such as false starts, mispronunciations and disfluencies are automatically corrected or left out. When studying spoken language and interpreting in particular, these spoken features are especially interesting and should be included in the transcripts. Therefore, the transcription process for such corpus material is still a process that requires substantial manual effort. A transcription of a spoken text can never fully mirror the acoustic signal (Bernardini et al., 2018). Depending on the research focus, linguistic, paralinguistic and extra-linguistic data will be included in greater or lesser detail. As our main research focus is on linguistic phenomena while ensuring comparability to other corpora of the EPIC family of corpora, we follow the transcription guidelines used for the compilation of EPICG, described in (Bernardini et al., 2018): As for the linguistic level, data were transcribed orthographically following the EU Interinstitutional Style Guide. In order to align source and target speeches on sentence level, sentence boundaries have to be included. EPICG uses EXMARaLDA (Schmidt and W\u00f6rner, 2014) to time-align source and target. Sentence annotation is therefore not described in the guidelines. As our aim is also to analyse target language features that might be triggered by a source language expression, we need sentence-equivalent segments in order to perform such an alignment. Here we opt for a similar approach as in EPIC: Sentence boundaries are detected using syntactic information as well as speakers intonation (annotated with \u2198). In spoken language, many main clauses are connected with coordinating conjunctions, leading to long parataxis. In order to get better alignment results during the next corpus compilation steps, we opt for the smallest possible sentence segment, splitting several coordinated clauses into individual segments such as in the example below, taken from the SI DE EN sub-corpus:\\n\\n\u2022 it's obvious for a country ruled by the state of law \u2198\\n\u2022 and I think it's a great shame that we have to talk about this / as if it weren't obvious / \u2198\\n\u2022 and therefore / the fact that we're saying / there should be a ceasefire / stop this weaponry / \u2198\\n\u2022 and we should be able to do everything possible / in a humanitarian way to cope with this conflict / \u2198\\n\\nAs for the paralinguistic level, filled and silent pauses were transcribed, truncated words and mispronunciations as well as possible ambiguities, following the EPICG guidelines in (Bernardini et al., 2018). Table 1 gives an overview of the transcription conventions used for the paralinguistic level. All transcriptions, revisions and segmentation of new and existing transcripts were carried out by one transcriber and validated by a second linguist.\\n\\n| Feature                      | Transcription          |\\n|------------------------------|------------------------|\\n| Silent pause                 | /                      |\\n| Filled pause                 | euh, hm, hum           |\\n| Mid-word pause               | spea/ euh ker [speaker]|\\n| Rising intonation            | [?]                    |\\n| Non-verbalized noise         | [noise], [breath]      |\\n| Non-standard pronunciation   | report [repo:rt]       |\\n| Inaudible segment            | [inaudible]            |\\n| Mispronunciation             | plenary [plenary]      |\\n| Truncated word               | propo/                 |\\n| Ambiguity                    | they [?there]          |\\n\\nTable 1: EPIC UdS transcription for interactional and non-verbal acoustic features based on EPICG (with minor modifications)\\n\\nFor more fine grained analysis purposes, metadata have to be stored as structural attributes. In accordance with EPIC and EPICG (Bernardini et al., 2018), Table 2 gives an overview of information on extra-linguistic level collected for EPIC UdS.\\n\\nAs in the existing EPIC corpora, source text delivery type was assigned depending on whether the source speaker could be seen reading a script (read) or not (impromptu), or switching between the two modes (mixed). Such extra-linguistic information is especially relevant for comparable corpus studies: Przybyl et al. (2022) show that interpreted speech compared to original spoken production in the EP is characterised by more spoken language features. In order to see whether this is a true interpreting effect or rather the result of some originals being written to be read out, studies need to take into account source speech delivery type.\\n\\n2 Speech delivery rate in accordance with classification in EPIC.\"}"}

Annotation\\n\\nDepending on research focus, it is sensible to ignore some of the features annotated and transcribed in the first place: if we are looking at syntactic complexity via automatic dependency parsed output, it makes sense to remove filled and silent pauses as well as truncated words in order to get better quality parsing results. For studies of disfluencies and possible triggers, fine grained annotation thereof are required. These, however, are a challenge for many tagging tools. Often used taggers such as Treetagger produce erroneous output for spoken language features. Some of them can fairly easy be corrected (e.g. for filled pauses), other such as truncated words belonging to different word classes are more difficult to handle.\\n\\n4. Corpus Variants\\n\\nWe provide several EPIC UdS corpus variants that can be used for different research purposes. The variants differ concerning the annotations used as well as spoken language features included. All corpus variants are accessible via https://corpora.clarin-d.uni-saarland.de/cqpweb/.\\n\\n4.1. Comparable Subcorpora\\n\\nEPIC UdS V2 is the comparable variant of the corpus. It can be used, for instance, for monolingual studies comparing the production of original speakers with that of interpreters in the same language. Table 3 gives an overview of EPIC UdS V2's subcorpora and their respective size.\\n\\nBesides lemmatisation and POS-information as annotation layers (UPOS as well as fine grained language specific POS: e.g. STTS for German, UPENN for English), universal dependency relations are also encoded including dependency relation to the head (deprel) and head of the current word (head).\\n\\nFor this, spaCy NLP tools (version 2.3.4) (Honnibal and Montani, 2017) and the corresponding language models (de_core_news-lg-2.3.0, en_core_web-lg-2.3.1) were used to process the sentence annotated transcripts. A randomly selected subset of 50 sentences for English and German was manually evaluated by two independent evaluators in order to assess the percentage of words with correct head (UAS: Unlabeled attachment score) and of words with correct head and label (LAS: Labeled attachment score). Table 4 gives an overview of the evaluated parsing accuracy for EPIC UdS V2 compared to stated parsing accuracy for the spaCy language models used. Due to spoken language features such as filled pauses, false starts and unfinished sentences present in the transcripts, parsing accuracy for both languages are well below the officially stated parsing accuracy. As simultaneous interpreting tends to use more spoken language features than the original speeches in the corpus (Przybyl et al., 2022), we expect accuracy results to be lower for SI compared to ORG. In order to increase parsing accuracy, we removed some spoken language features and used Stanza language models (v1.2.3) (Qi et al., 2020) in a further corpus variant (EPIC-UdS V3). With these measures we were able to increase accuracy scores to 85.94 (LAS) and 89.08 (UAS) for English and 85.78 (LAS) and 91.03 (UAS) for German.\\n\\nAccuracy scores have only been evaluated for the comparable datasets EN and DE.\"}"}

Parallel Corpora\\n\\nFor the parallel and aligned variants of EPIC UdS we used Intertext to automatically align and manually correct source and target sentences. Two parallel corpus variants are available \u2013 EPIC UdS aligned/parsed and EPIC UdS aligned/POS \u2013 with different focus: The first aligned corpus variant includes dependency parsing. In order to achieve better parsing quality, we remove truncated words, filled and silent pauses etc. in this corpus variant. For comparability of source and target parses, the parser used in the above-mentioned V2 variant of the corpus is not suitable as spaCy uses language specific dependency tags. In the aligned and parsed variants, we therefore opt for the Stanford NLP Python Library Stanza, so that dependency relations can be compared across languages. The second aligned variant is lemmatised and POS-tagged. Here we include some spoken features (e.g., filled pauses) and if necessary, manually correct their incorrect POS assignment, in order to pursue studies on disfluencies. These aligned corpus variants are currently being finalised for publication.\\n\\n5. Applications\\n\\n5.1. Comparable Corpora\\n\\nWe use the comparable corpus variant EPIC UdS V2 and the comparable written dataset Europarl UdS (Karakanta et al., 2018) in order to detect translationese/interpretese features. By applying a divergence measure (here: Kullback-Leibler Divergence) on probability distributions over words obtained by n-gram models, we compare translation and interpreting including comparison to their written/spoken originals (Przybyl et al., 2022). The study confirms the overall trend of written vs. spoken mode being strongly reflected in translation and interpreting output. Specifically for interpreting, we observe a higher degree of orality (e.g. expressed by such distinctive items as filled pauses, discourse markers, deictics and intensifiers) compared to spoken originals (Figure 1), which confirms previous observations made by Shlesinger and Ordan (2012).\\n\\nThe rich linguistic annotations of EPIC UdS V2, especially dependency parsing, are used to study syntactic complexity in interpreting, particularly dependency length minimisation (Przybyl and Teich, 2021). Using the annotated dependency relations, dependency distance of head and dependent were calculated for each word in the corpus. Syntactic complexity indicators such as average dependency length, maximum dependency length and number of adjacent dependencies for the English and German comparable corpora show a reduction of syntactic complexity in interpreted speech compared to originals in the same language. Especially long dependency relations occur less frequently in interpreting (cf. Figure 2). However, the trend of dependency length minimisation in interpreting can mainly be related to shorter sentences in interpreting than originals overall and can not be observed when comparing sentence of the same length in English.\\n\\n5.2. Parallel Corpora\\n\\nRecently, multilingual embeddings have proven to be very useful for multilingual computational modelling. Although, interpreting corpora are small in size, they can also be used for this approach, as it was shown for the parallel variants of our corpora. Both Bizzoni and Teich (2019) and Lapshinova-Koltunski et al. (2021b), compared bilingual word embeddings in translation and interpreting. In these studies, the aligned sentences were used to train a standard skip n-gram Word2Vec model and to create bilingual neural semantic spaces for translation and interpreting. Such spaces contain words with similar contexts, with context of each word being words in both languages of the aligned sentences in which a particular word occurs. The spaces of the same words in translation and interpreting were then analysed and compared. The main idea of this method is that words with a consistent translation share similar contexts with their equivalents and fall in close proximity. The imbalance in size between translation and interpreting corpora does not pose a problem for the comparison task, as it was shown in (Bizzoni and Teich, 2019, p. 5).\"}"}

Black denotes more frequent use in original, grey marks more frequent use in simultaneous interpreting.\\n\\nBilingual embeddings trained on our corpora can be used for the analysis of various linguistic aspects. For instance, Bizzoni and Teich (2019) analyse general lexical differences between interpreting and translation. They found that formulaic or highly predictable words are always translated with the same equivalent in interpreting. Besides that, semantic spaces of interpreting seem to contain more domain-specific and technical terminology instead of more stylistic features, e.g. interpersonal and textual expressions or adverbs. At the same time, (Lapshinova-Koltunski et al., 2021b) focus on the level of discourse, comparing neural semantic spaces of discourse connectives in translation and interpreting. Apart from general differences between semantic spaces of interpreting and translation that were also reported by Bizzoni and Teich (2019), this study observed the following differences: Interpreting use more general connectives to mark logical relations, which is in line with the existing observations about differences between speech and writing (Crible and Cuenca, 2017). Besides that, interpreting exhibits reduced variability in connectives (fewer types) which leads to stronger clusters (i.e. cosine similarity is higher) if compared to translated texts (cf. Table 5). The fact that semantic spaces of many connectives in interpreted texts do not contain any equivalents point to implicitation effects also discussed in the literature about interpreting. In this way, interpreting shows more implicitation than translation. Apart from these general tendencies, we also discovered that cognitive complexity of relations has impact on the resulting semantic spaces in translation with cognitively more complex relations like concession being reflected in the translation space whereas cognitively simpler relations such as expansion and contingency more often being left out (as also reported by Hoek et al. (2017). However, this effect can not be seen in the interpreting spaces.\\n\\nTable 5: Translation and interpreting spaces for if, as and secondly and the nearest neighbours with cosine similarity; semantically unrelated items in brackets (Lapshinova-Koltunski et al., 2021b).\\n\\n| TR space | SI space |\\n|----------|----------|\\n| wenn .87; dann .72; | |\\n| as (angesehen .53) wie 0.57 |\\n| secondly zweitens .76 zweitens .82 |\\n\\n6. Discussion and Future Work\\n\\nWe provide several variants of a European Parliament interpreting corpus for the language combinations English, German and Spanish that can be used for a vast range of applications and study purposes. This includes applications presented in this paper, but also specifically extends to cognitive aspects of the interpreting process traceable in the interpreting product as well as applications for interpreter training, applications in translation and interpreting research other than the ones mentioned in this paper or for scholars of conversation and discourse analysis.\\n\\n Corpus-based approaches to interpreting process research to reflect cognitive load in interpreting have recently received more attention. Approaches include studying filled pauses triggered by numbers, lexical density, formulaicity and syntactic complexity (Plevoets and Defrancq, 2016; Defrancq and Plevoets, 2018; Plevoets and Defrancq, 2020) or cognates and low frequency words (Chmiel et al., 2021). Furthermore, phonetic features such as pitch are promising in mirroring cognitive load in simultaneous interpreting (Defrancq, 2021).\\n\\nIn order to allow for more fine grained analysis of phonetic features linked to cognitive load we also plan to align a subset of the data in Praat (Boersma and Weenink, 2001). This will enable us to study the interplay of interpreters lag, disfluencies and phonetic features. Furthermore, we are also working on improving the existing material by adding metadata that can not be easily obtained: We are currently including manual interpreter identification in order to exclude interpreter idiosyncrasies from the results.\\n\\nEPIC UdS is a rich resource to be used on its own, in combination with written European Parliament corpora as shown in the applications discussed above, or combined with other interpreting corpora. With a focus on efficient use of existing resources we based our corpus on guidelines available for other corpora of the EPIC family, and therefore EPIC UdS can easily be used in combination with these resources in order to\"}"}
