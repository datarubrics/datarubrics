Low Saxon is a West-Germanic low-resource language that lacks a common standard and therefore poses challenges for NLP. The 1,000 sentences in our dataset cover the last 200 years and 8 of the 9 major dialects. They are presented both in original and in normalised spelling and two lemmata are provided: A Modern Low Saxon lemma and a Middle Low Saxon lemma. Several annotation-related issues result from dialectal variation in morphological categories, and we explain differences in the pronoun, gender, case, and mood system. Furthermore, we take up three syntactic constructions that do not occur in Standard Dutch or Standard German: the possessive dative, pro-drop in pronominal adverbs, and complementiser doubling in subordinate interrogative clauses. These constructions are also rare in the other Germanic UD datasets and have not always been annotated consistently.\\n\\nKeywords: Universal Dependencies, Low Saxon, Low German, low-resource, non-standard\\n\\n1. Introduction\\nLow Saxon is a West-Germanic language primarily spoken in the north-eastern Netherlands and northern Germany by an estimated number of 3\u20134 million people. Figure 1 shows the area in the early 20th century including the East Pomeranian (POM) and Low Prussian (NPR), which were spoken in these eastern areas until the end of WWII. Despite official recognition in both countries, there is no interregional standard. This means that a high degree of both orthographic and dialectal variation needs to be taken into consideration in NLP. Since carefully annotated datasets for Modern Low Saxon are still scarce, this extension of the UD dataset is part of our ongoing efforts to fill this gap.\\n\\n2. Data\\nTable 1 shows the size of the dataset by the dialects included. The East Pomeranian (POM) dialect shown in Figure 1 is missing due to a lack of data, since the only resources we have managed to obtain so far consist of poems and songs which do not lend themselves well to syntactic annotation. Our dataset primarily covers the last 200 years with a focus on the older period, since it is easier to obtain copyright-free material from that time. In addition, due to data scarcity, we have included a few sentences from the late 17th century in the Eastphalian (OFL) part of the dataset. The largest part of the new sentences stems from train, develop and test sets we had annotated for other purposes. These train, development and test sets had been randomly chosen from the LSDC dataset (Siewert et al., 2020), which has led to some imbalance in the dialect representation. When we complemented this data with other resources to raise the number of sentences to 1,000, we prioritised the underrepresented dialects. This means an addition of more than 900 sentences compared with the 2.12 release from May 2023.\\n\\nTable 1: The size of the dataset by the dialects included.\\n\\n| Dialect Group | Abbreviation | Sentences | Tokens | Lemmata |\\n|---------------|--------------|-----------|--------|---------|\\n| Brandenburgish | BRA          | 48        | 1,703  | 464     |\\n| Dutch North Saxon | NNS        | 50        | 1,225  | 340     |\\n| Dutch Westphalian | NWF      | 229       | 5,141  | 1,133   |\\n| Eastphalian   | OFL          | 50        | 1,575  | 460     |\\n| German North Saxon | DNS      | 225       | 4,266  | 1,034   |\\n| German Westphalian | DWF      | 238       | 4,471  | 1,012   |\\n| Low Prussian  | NPR          | 36        | 745    | 266     |\\n| Mecklenburgish | MVP          | 124       | 3,505  | 833     |\\n| **Total**     |              | **1,000** | **22,631** | **5,542** |\"}"}
{"id": "lrec-2024-main-1388", "page_num": 2, "content": "{\"primary_language\":\"en\",\"is_rotation_valid\":true,\"rotation_correction\":0,\"is_table\":false,\"is_diagram\":false,\"natural_text\":\"might be followed by further information on, for instance, the dialect subgroup, the exact place of publication, the name of the author or the title of the work, where available.\\n\\nThe preannotation of PoS tags, morphological features, and dependency relations was done with Stanza (Qi et al., 2020) trained on West Germanic and mainland Scandinavian UD datasets, while the Stanza lemmatiser was trained on the Reference Corpus Middle Low German / Low Rhenish (ReN-Team, 2021). Subsequently, we have manually corrected and validated these automatic annotations.\\n\\nThe annotation of the main lemmata in Modern Low Saxon has been an entirely manual undertaking.\\n\\n3. Spelling normalisation and lemmatisation\\n\\nThe sentences are provided both in the original spelling in the text_orig line, and in normalised spelling in the text line.\\n\\nIn the absence of a common standard, we use the interregional spelling Nysassiske Skryvwyse that has been adopted by the Dutch Low Saxon Wikipedia and the Low Saxon Wiktionary. This spelling strives to bring the Low Saxon dialects closer together orthographically by basing the grapheme usage on historical phoneme correspondences instead of particular local modern pronunciations. For instance, the word for book that might be written as Bauk, bouk, book, Bok, boek or beok in a variety of local spellings is unified to book based on the origin of the vowel in Proto-Germanic *\u00afo. Nevertheless, the Nysassiske skryvwyse represents variation to account for divergent developments that make it impossible to regularly derive all local pronunciations from one orthographical form. The cognate of over, for example, may be written oaver or \u00f6\u00e4ver depending on whether the vowel exhibits i-mutation in the dialect in question. The normalised text reflects such local characteristics.\\n\\nThe main lemma is given in the Nysassiske Skryvwyse as well, but here, we use the same lemma forms across dialects. In instances where divergent forms are found in today\u2019s dialects, the variant closest to the Middle Low Saxon dictionary form is chosen as the modern lemma. The North S\u00e1mi UD corpus (Sheyanova and Tyers, 2017) follows a similar approach with representation of dialectal variation in the text field and a standardised lemma.\\n\\nIn some cases, however, more than one modern lemma can correspond to the same Middle Low Saxon lemma. This usually happens when a word has developed different forms depending on the syntactic function. For instance, the indefinite and definite article have developed forms distinct from the corresponding indefinite and demonstrative pronouns in many dialects. Therefore, we lemmatise the articles as en and de, and the pronouns as eyn and dee.\\n\\nIn addition to Modern Low Saxon lemmata, we provide a second lemma in normalised Middle Low Saxon in the tenth column as lemma_gml, since linguists working on (historical) Low Saxon are likely to be familiar with this spelling. Our spelling largely follows the Mittelniederdeutsches Handw\u00f6rterbuch by Lasch et al. (1928ff.) that is also used in the Reference Corpus Middle Low German / Low Rhenish (1200\u20131650) (ReN-Team, 2021). In order to ease the manual annotation, however, we have removed superscript numbers and parentheses, and made a few grapheme simplifications such as <\u00eai> to <\u00eai> and <\u02d8\u00afa> to <a> or <\u00afa> depending on the context. Furthermore, we have unified the annotation of certain suffixes: E.g., the usage of the variants l\u02dc\u0131k, -l\u02dc\u0131ke, -l\u02dc\u0131ken, -l\u02dc\u0131ke(n), -l\u02dc\u0131ke(s), -liken and -haftich, -hachtich, -haft, -hacht, -haftigen, -haftigen was systematised in such a way that -l\u02dc\u0131k and -haftich are used for the adjective and -l\u02dc\u0131ken and -haftigen for the adverb.\\n\\n4. PoS and Morphological annotation\\n\\nThe Low Saxon dataset uses all Universal PoS tags except for \u2018SYM\u2019. So far, this tag has not been necessary, as the dataset does not contain emojis, currency symbols or mathematical operators yet. Due to the lack of a common standard, we find a few differences in morphological categories in the various dialects and time periods. This means that the same form can fulfill different functions based on the variety, which is reflected in the annotation of morphological features.\\n\\n4.1. Personal pronouns\\n\\nThe reference of some pronouns is ambiguous due to (historical) use as expressions of politeness. Several Dutch Low Saxon dialects, especially in the southern part of the language area, have lost or are in the process of losing the second person singular pronoun du/d\u00fb and extending the use of jy/g\u00ee to the singular. It is often not possible to tell from the context whether a single person is addressed with jy/g\u00ee for reasons of politeness or if the pronoun du/d\u00fb has already fallen out of use in the variety in question. Nor is it always possible to decide whether one or more persons are being referred to by jy/g\u00ee.\\n\\nThe annotation of jy/g\u00ee and verbs agreeing with it follows the context. Thus, the annotation...\"}"}

Polite-\\nness annotation Polite=Form is only added if the\\ncontext leaves no room for doubt and in our dataset\\nwe have only encountered such cases in northern\\nDutch Low Saxon and German Low Saxon.\\n\\nIn German Low Saxon, we find the third person\\nplural see/s\u00ea used as a politeness marker in part of\\nthe dialects. Since the polite pronoun and agreeing\\nverbs refer to the addressee, they will be annotated\\nas Person=2.\\n\\n4.2. Feminine-masculine distinction\\nAnother difference in morphological categories is\\nthe number of grammatical genders. Most Low\\nSaxon dialects have three genders: feminine, mas-\\nculine, and neuter, whereas remainder see the\\nmerging of the feminine and masculine genders\\ninto a common gender and show no overt distinc-\\ntion on the noun, agreeing determiners or adjec-\\ntives. Personal pronouns, however, might reveal\\nthe gender of the noun.\\n\\nGender marking poses problems for both the hu-\\nman annotator and the annotation model for two\\nother reasons as well: First, even in dialects with\\ndistinct feminine and masculine forms, the distinc-\\ntion is not overt in all inflectional forms. In many\\ndialects, for example, feminine and masculine noun\\nphrases have the same form in the determinate\\nnominative, while forms are distinct in the indeter-\\nminate nominative or the determinate accusative.\\nAdditionally, no gender distinction is marked in the\\nplural. Second, there is dialectal variation in gender\\nassignment and, for many local varieties, the gen-\\nder of words is not documented. This is especially\\ntrue for Dutch Low Saxon, where many dictionaries\\ndo not even mention the gender category. This\\nsituation is further complicated by the contact with\\nDutch. As Bloemhoff et al. (2019) have observed,\\nspeakers of Twents, a Dutch Westphalian dialect,\\nincreasingly struggle with the gender assignment\\nof nouns that have common gender in Dutch.\\n\\nGenerally, we strive to disambiguate the gender\\nbased on the context or other available sources,\\nsuch as dictionaries for the target or a closely re-\\nlated variety. If no such information can be ob-\\ntained, or the noun can carry both genders, we use\\nthe combined feature Gender=Fem,Masc. This\\nfeature is also used for gender-ambiguous forms\\nof pronouns, such as the demonstrative/relative\\npronoun dee/d\u00ea 'that' or the interrogative pronoun\\nwek/welk 'which'.\\n\\n4.3. Case inventory\\nThe size of the case system differs from dialect\\nto dialect. While nominative and accusative are\\ndistinguished in the personal pronouns everywhere\\n(compare Lindow et al., 1998), especially varieties\\nthat have been influenced by Dutch do not inflect\\nnouns for case. In addition to Dutch Low Saxon,\\nthis is true for, e.g., East Frisian 4 (L\u00fccht, 2016, 62).\\n\\nDespite the lack of overt marking in a few vari-\\neties, thenominative-accusativedistinctionisanno-\\ntated throughout on pronouns, nouns, and agreeing\\ndependents such as determiners and adjectives.\\n\\nProductive dative forms have been preserved\\nin several German Westphalian and Eastphalian\\nvarieties (cf. Lindow et al., 1998), as shown in\\nExample (1) from East Westphalian.\\n\\n(1) Ik sto in der Gemoene parish. Denste service.\\n\\n'I stand in the service of the parish.'\\n\\nIn other areas, dative remnants may occur after spe-\\ncific prepositions, e.g., in the German North Saxon\\nExample (2) after bi.\\n\\n(2) Mi weer de Sun to grall bi 'n reading.\\n\\n'The sun was too bright for me while reading.'\\n\\nThe historical genitive, however, has almost com-\\npletely fallen out of use in the whole language area\\nand Example (3) exhibiting this case, in fact comes\\nfrom the late 17th century Eastphalian texts men-\\ntioned in Section 2.\\n\\n(3) na synes his. gen \u00f6ldesten Broders gen Doode\\ndat 'after the death of his oldest brother'\\n\\nForms bearing the feature Case=Gen most com-\\nmonly refer to a possessive construction resem-\\nbling the English \\\"Saxon genitive\\\", such as in the\\nDutch North Saxon example 'n mouders ooge zucht scharp 'a mother's eye sees sharp' from our\\ndataset.\\n\\n4.4. Subjunctive mood\\nDistinct subjunctive forms have been lost in most\\nLow Saxon dialects today, and their use is mostly\\nconfined to parts of Westphalia and Eastphalia.\\nOne predominantly finds the past subjunctive in\\n\\n4 The varieties spoken in East Frisia which are part\\nof German North Saxon (DNS); not the East Frisian lan-\\nguage Saterlandic spoken outside of East Frisia.\"}"}

As a result, subjunctive forms are used without distinction in subjunctive and indicative meaning. (Saltveit, 1983, 298\u2013301).\\n\\nFormally ambiguous cases, i.e., indicative forms in context that historically or in other dialects would require subjunctive forms are annotated with the combined feature Mood=Ind,Sub.\\n\\n5. Dependencies\\n\\n5.1. Possessive dative construction\\n\\nLow Saxon has three primary possessive constructions: A \\\"Saxongenitive\\\" similar to English, a prepositional construction using van 'of', and a possessive dative. In the possessive dative construction, the possessum is preceded by the possessor in the dative case and a possessive determiner, as can be seen in Example (1) above.\\n\\nIn case a distinct dative case has been preserved, otherwise a form corresponding to the accusative or nominative may appear.\\n\\nAs shown in Figure 2, the possessive determiner connects to the head noun with a det relationship, and the possessor with an nmod:poss relationship to the possessive determiner of the possessum. The reason for this is that the possessive determiner of the possessum is obligatory, so that the possessor in the dative case cannot be connected without it.\\n\\n5.2. Pro-drop in separable pronominal adverbs\\n\\nSimilar to Dutch, pronominal adverbs in Low Saxon are commonly separable. We follow the Dutch annotation and connect the pronominal part tagged as 'ADV' as obl, and the prepositional part tagged as 'ADP' is connected to it as case.\\n\\nThis is illustrated by the German Westphalian sentence in Figure 3 from our dataset.\\n\\nUnlike in Standard Dutch, pro-drop of the pronominal part is fairly common, leaving only the prepositional part. An example of this is the Brandenburgish sentence in Figure 4 from our dataset.\\n\\nIn such cases, we tag the remaining prepositional part as 'ADV' and connect it as advmod, in the same way an unseparated doavan would be.\"}"}
{"id": "lrec-2024-main-1388", "page_num": 5, "content": "{\"primary_language\":\"en\",\"is_rotation_valid\":true,\"rotation_correction\":0,\"is_table\":false,\"is_diagram\":false,\"natural_text\":\"5.3. Complementiser doubling in subordinate interrogative clauses\\n\\nIn several Low Saxon varieties, interrogative adverbs in indirect questions as well as relative pronouns can be followed by an additional complementiser as 'as' or 'dat' 'that'. This is illustrated by the German North Saxon sentence from Wisser (1921, 29):\\n\\nUn da.rmit secht de ol Mann em Besch\u00ead, wodenni as he dat maken schall.\\n\\n'And with this, the old man tells him how he should do it.' This construction is already attested in Medieval Low Saxon and occurs in other West-Germanic varieties as well (Schallert et al., 2018), for instance, in Frisian (Popkema, 2018, 299). In contrast, this construction does not occur in either of the majority languages Standard Dutch or Standard German.\\n\\nThis construction appears in the Frisian Dutch UD dataset (Braggaar and van der Goot, 2021), where they unexpectedly write it as a contraction instead of splitting it on two lines. E.g., in de order dy'tnobinnenkaamis 'the order that has now come in', dy't is treated as a single element.\\n\\nIn contrast, the following sentence from Wisser (1921) shows that, at least in Low Saxon, other words can be placed in between the interrogative adverb ('wo' 'how') and the complementiser as:\\n\\nun will [...] s\u00eahn, wo wid as se t\u00f4 s\u00fcnd\\n\\n'and wants to see how far they are'. As a result, we connect it as mark to the verb and not as fixed to the adverb as shown in Figure 5.\\n\\nFigure 5: Complementiser doubling.\\n\\n6. Summary and future plans\\n\\nWe have presented a substantial extension of the first Low Saxon dataset on Universal Dependencies and hope our discussion of approaches for dealing with the lack of a common standard variety to be useful for annotation work on other languages in comparable situations.\\n\\nWe plan to continue the extension of the treebank and work in particular on the underrepresented varieties. This will likely require us to also draw from other sources than the original LSDC by Siewert et al. (2020).\\n\\nFurthermore, we would like to initiate an exchange on the annotation of, e.g., the possessive dative construction in order to come to an agreement across datasets and languages.\\n\\n7.
