In this paper, we explore fine-grained solidarity frames to study solidarity towards women and migrants in German parliamentary debates between 1867 and 2022. Using 2,864 manually annotated text snippets (with a cost exceeding 18k Euro), we evaluate large language models (LLMs) like Llama 3, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4. We find that GPT-4 outperforms other LLMs, approaching human annotation quality. Using GPT-4, we automatically annotate more than 18k further instances (with a cost of around 500 Euro) across 155 years and find that solidarity with migrants outweighs anti-solidarity but that frequencies and solidarity types shift over time. Most importantly, group-based notions of (anti-)solidarity fade in favor of compassionate solidarity, focusing on the vulnerability of migrant groups, and exchange-based anti-solidarity, focusing on the lack of (economic) contribution. Our study highlights the interplay of historical events, socio-economic needs, and political ideologies in shaping migration discourse and social cohesion. We also show that powerful LLMs, if carefully prompted, can be cost-effective alternatives to human annotation for hard social scientific tasks.\\n\\n1 Introduction\\nSolidarity is a crucial concept for understanding how societies achieve and maintain stability and cohesion (Reynolds, 2014), and it plays a critical role in shaping policies (Laitinen and Pessi, 2014). Traditionally, solidarity relied on common identity and reciprocity, potentially excluding out-groups like migrants (Hopman and Knijn, 2022) and reinforcing social boundaries and hierarchies (Anthias, 2014). However, growing diversity and increasing socio-economic, political, religious, and cultural complexities of modern societies (Kymlicka, 2020) call such traditional forms of solidarity into question. Simultaneously, recent populist movements challenge policies that support equality, such as equal opportunity or reproductive rights of women (Inglehart and Norris, 2016). These evolving complexities motivate a deeper and broader study of social solidarity, namely (i) a fine-grained exploration of different forms of social solidarity to reflect its multifaceted nature (Oosterlynck and Bouchaute, 2013), and (ii) a broader historical analysis to trace its evolution from the 19th century to today (Banting and Kymlicka, 2017). In this work, we contribute to such a systematic study of solidarity by tracing fine-grained notions of solidarity and anti-solidarity towards two target groups, women and migrants, in political speech, namely German parliamentary debates from 1867 to 2022 (Walter et al., 2021). We employ the social solidarity framework by Thijssen (2012) that incorporates rational (group-based and exchange-based) and emotive...\"}"}

In the transitional provisions, this stipulation has been repealed for those who had already reached the age of 16 on January 1, 1962. My faction finds this regulation unfair, as it would exempt significant groups of people from this maintenance obligation. Especially women who have made great efforts to send their children to higher education, for example, would have to bear these costs alone.\\n\\n(2) Exchange-based anti-solidarity towards migrants\\n(Apr. 19, 2018)\\n\\n\\\"[...] Let me also add: Migration is not necessarily successful \u2013 you always act as if that is great \u2013 it can fail, and it fails in particular when the immigrants' qualifications are low. In 2013, before the so-called refugee wave, 40 percent of immigrants from non-EU countries had no qualifications. Since the wave of refugees, stabbings have increased by 20 percent, and we have imported anti-Semitism in the country. Does this make for an outstandingly successful migration?\\\"\\n\\n(3) Mixed stance towards migrants\\n(Feb. 2, 1982)\\n\\n\\\"[...] We must accept that in a few years we will again need a higher number of foreign workers in the Federal Republic, as Mr. Urbaniak hinted earlier. In reality, therefore, we must commit to effective integration, which admittedly requires [...] that there can be no exceptions, no alternative, regarding the recruitment stop and the prevention of illegal immigration [...].\\\"\\n\\n(4) None case (women)\\n(June 17, 2015)\\n\\n\\\"[...] 'We want to be free people!' There is probably no better phrase to open today's debate here in the German Bundestag about the popular uprising of 1953.

Original German texts, as well as examples of mixed stance and none, are available in Table 3 in the Appendix.\\n\\n(5) (compassionate and empathic) elements of solidarity (refer to Fig. 1 and Section 4 for more details on the typology). We focus on migrants, central for solidarity discourse in European and German politics (Thr\u00e4nhardt, 1993; Faist, 1994; Fr\u00f6hlich, 2023; Lehr, 2015), and women as an \u201coppressed majority\u201d historically marginalized from public life (Calloni, 2020). As manual annotation of (anti-)solidarity concepts in all parliamentary proceedings over this 155-year period using traditional sociological methods is practically infeasible, we explore the use of language models for this complex task. In particular, we assess the efficacy of BERT, Llama-3, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4, to detect expressions of various (anti-)solidarity types in parliamentary texts, aiming to identify the best performing model for our large-scale analysis. From an NLP perspective, this task is semantically and pragmatically challenging because, (i) expressions of (anti-)solidarity are often implied rather than explicitly stated in the text and their meaning is affected by the political and historical context in which they are made (see the examples in Table 1; Sravanthi et al., 2024); (ii) German data, especially evolving German language over 155 years, is under-represented in common training data sets for LLMs, which may affect performance (Ahuja et al., 2023; Qin et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2024); and (iii) LLMs might struggle with annotating complex sociological concepts, achieving lower quality and reliability compared to human annotators (Wang et al., 2021; Ding et al., 2022; Zhu et al., 2023; Pangakis et al., 2023).\\n\\nOur contributions are: (i) We provide a human annotated training & evaluation dataset of 2,864 text snippets, which required 40+ hours weekly from 4-5 annotators over nine months, totaling an investment of approximately 18k Euro; (ii) we conduct a comparative analysis of LLMs on a complex sociological task in which pre-trained language models (esp. GPT-4) outperform an open-source model Llama-3-70B-Instruct, as well as models fine-tuned for this task (BERT, GPT-3.5 fine tuned); (iii) we provide fine-grained insights into solidarity discourse concerning migrants in Germany in the last 155 years across different political parties.

Recent CSS studies have leveraged LLMs for a variety of complex tasks. Ziems et al. (2024) conduct a comprehensive evaluation of LLMs, pointing out their weaknesses in tasks which require understanding of subjective expert taxonomies that deviate from the training data of LLMs (such as implicit hate and empathy classification). LLMs enhance text-as-data methods in social sciences, particularly in analyzing political ideology (Wu et al., 2023), but struggle with social language understanding, often outperformed by fine-tuned models (Choi et al., 2023). Zhang et al. (2023) introduced SPARROW, a benchmark showing ChatGPT's limitations in sociopragmatic understanding across languages. In exploring German migration debates, Blokker et al. (2020) and Zaberer et al. (2023) utilize fine-tuning of transformer-based language models to classify claims in German newspapers. Chen et al. (2022) apply LLM-based classification on German social media posts to study public controversies over the course of one decade. In contrast to these approaches, we apply LLMs to longitudinal historical data and explore it for a new challenging task, fine-grained detection of social solidarity.\\n\\nAnalysis of parliamentary debates using NLP tools. Abercrombie and Batista-Navarro (2020a) review 61 studies on sentiment and position-taking within parliamentary contexts, covering dictionary-based sentiment scoring, statistical machine learning, and other conventional NLP methods. In terms of specific methodologies, studies often deploy: (i) shallow classifiers, where Lai et al. (2020) use SVM, Na\u00efve Bayes, and Logistic Regression for multilingual stance detection; (ii) deep learning approaches, with Abercrombie and Batista-Navarro (2020b) applying BERT, Al Hamoud et al. (2022) exploring LSTM variants, and Sawhney et al. (2020) introducing GPolS for political speech analysis; (iii) probabilistic models, as in Vilares and He (2017)'s Bayesian approach to identify top-ics and perspectives in debates. With German political debates, M\u00fcller-Hansen et al. (2021) use topic modeling to study shifts in German parliamentary discussions on coal due to changes in energy policy, while Walter et al. (2021) employ diachronic word embeddings to track antisemitic and anti-communist biases in these debates. More recently, Bornheim et al. (2023) apply Llama 2 to automate speaker attribution in German parliamentary debates from 2017-2021. Our research goes beyond this by adopting recent powerful LLMs to track changes of a specific social concept, social solidarity, in plenary debates from three centuries.\\n\\nSocial solidarity in NLP. Previous studies of social solidarity in NLP have largely focused on social media platforms. For example, Santhanam et al. (2019) study how emojis are used to express solidarity in social media during Hurricane Irma in 2017 and Paris terrorist attacks from November 2015. Ils et al. (2021) consider solidarity in European social media discourse around COVID-19. Eger et al. (2022) extend this work by examining how design choices, like keyword selection and language, affect assessments of solidarity changes over time. Compared to these works, we use a similar methodological setup (annotate data and infer trends), but focus on parliamentary debates instead of social media, employ a much more fine-grained sociological framework (Thijssen, 2012), and use LLMs for systematic categorization and examination of solidarity types over time.\\n\\n3 Data\\n\\nWe obtain data from two sources: (i) Open Data, covering Bundestag (en.: federal diet) protocols from 1949 until today; and (ii) Reichstagsprotokolle covering Reichstag (en.: imperial diet) protocols until 1945. 1 We use the OCR-scanned version from Walter et al. (2021). Links to data, models, etc. used are in Appendix D. For the Reichstag data, we apply preprocessing steps similar to Walter et al. (2021) (e.g., removal of OCR artifacts), but keep German umlauts, capitalization, and punctuation. We automatically split the data into individual sittings and collect metadata like the date, period and number of each sitting, which we manually check and correct. Additionally, we removed interjections and split the text into sentences using NLTK (Bird et al., 2009), resulting in 19.1M sentences. We release this dataset of plenary protocols from German political debates (DeuParl) consisting of 9,923 sittings from 1867 to 2022 on GitHub. 2 To select keywords, we (i) train a Word2Vec model (Mikolov et al., 2013) on our dataset to identify words with vector representations similar to Migrant (en.: migrant) and Frau (en.: woman); (ii) manually expand this list with intuitively relevant terms; (iii) from both lists, we filter for those which could not be included due to lack of availability.\\n\\n1 Volkskammer (en.: Eastern German parliament) protocols could not be included due to lack of availability.\\n2 https://github.com/DominikBeese/DeuParl-v2\"}"}

This resulted in 32 keywords for Migrant and 18 keywords for Frau. These include general terms like Migrant, Immigrant and Frau to period-specific terms, such as Vertriebene (en.: expellees) and B\u00fcrgerkriegsfl\u00fcchtlinge (en.: civil war refugees), or social roles, such as M\u00fctter (en.: mothers) and Hausfrauen (en.: housewives). See the full list of keywords, and further preprocessing in Appendix A. For a detailed keyword distribution across the dataset, see Fig. 11 and Fig. 12 in the Appendix.\\n\\nUsing these keywords, we extract 58k main sentences (instances) for migrants and 131k for women from DeuParl, expanding each with three preceding and three following sentences for context, resulting in a total of (i) 463k sentences (9.79M tokens) for migrants and (ii) 1.58M sentences (32.82M tokens) for women. Fig. 2 shows the number of instances over time.\\n\\nFig. 7 in the Appendix shows yearly relative frequencies of sentences with terms related to women and migrants in the entire dataset. It is notable that both Frau and Migrant terms represent a minor fraction of the discourse, typically under 0.02. Periodic spikes in mentions likely align with historical and societal changes, such as post-WWII for Migrant.\\n\\n4 Data annotation\\n\\nTo obtain ground truth data for model training and evaluation, we annotated 2864 instances with five annotators (all student assistants, with specializations in social science or computer science). The annotation was performed over a duration of nine months. In the first three months, we iteratively refined the annotation guidelines and monitored the inter-rater agreement (measured by Cohen's Kappa) until inter-rater agreement converged (see Section 4.2 for exact scores) and annotators began annotating independently.\\n\\n4.1 Annotation task design\\n\\nFor the manual annotation, we take the target sentence and three preceding and following sentences for context into account. We first select a high-level category (solidarity, anti-solidarity, mixed, none). Solidarity or anti-solidarity cases are then further distinguished into frames as defined by Thijssen and Verheyen (2022): group-based, compassionate, exchange-based, and empathic. We describe each of the included variables below.\\n\\nHigh-level categories. Based on Lahusen and Grasso (2018) and Ils et al. (2021), we define solidarity as willingness to share resources, directly or indirectly, or support for target groups, and anti-solidarity as statements restricting resources, showing unwillingness to support, or implying exclusion of these groups. Texts with both supporting and opposing expressions are labeled mixed, while neutral or unrelated texts are labeled none.\\n\\nGroup-based solidarity is coded for texts emphasizing shared identity and common goals among group members, whereas group-based anti-solidarity emphasizes out-group exclusion based on perceived differences.\\n\\nCompassionate solidarity is coded for texts supporting marginalized groups, emphasizing their need for protection, while compassionate anti-solidarity dismisses these groups by considering them already in a good position, minimizing their need support or protection.\\n\\nExchange-based solidarity is coded when texts highlight the economic contributions of \u201cexchange partners\u201d and potential rewards or further contributions. Conversely, exchange-based anti-solidarity calls for penalizing groups perceived as receiving more than they contribute.\\n\\nEmpathic solidarity is coded when a speaker expresses respect for individual differences, seeing social diversity as beneficial, while empathic anti-solidarity arises when differences are used as grounds for exclusion or neglect.\\n\\nAnnotation involved elaborate explanations, with identification of (anti-)solidarity resources.\"}"}

We observe three main disagreement issues in annotation: misclassification of none cases, confusion between mixed stance and anti-solidarity, and overlap within solidarity and anti-solidarity subtypes (see Fig. 6 in the Appendix). This confusion is often due to overlapping characteristics or the presence of multiple subtypes within the text; moreover, this annotation task is inherently subjective, which can lead to differing interpretations. This is further evidenced by our average agreement scores. Table 6 in the Appendix provides examples of annotator divergence, explaining why multiple labels could be correct, which gives insight into more difficult instances. However, there was almost no confusion between solidarity and anti-solidarity. We note less stability in annotator agreement before 1930, stabilizing in subsequent years (see Fig. 14a in the Appendix).\\n\\nAlthough these variations can stem from the complexities of historical language and diverse interpretations of past events, they might also stem from the unbalanced distribution of human annotated data over the decades (see Fig. 4).\\n\\nOur dataset comprises 2864 annotated instances, 1437 for migrants and 1427 for women. We note that anti-solidarity accounts for 13.5% of instances, being more common among migrants (12.1%) than women (1.4%) (see Table 5a in the Appendix). 368 instances in our dataset (referred to as curated) were reviewed by a social science expert to provide a reliable comparison benchmark for evaluation of our models. Other consensus mechanisms for the final labels in the human-annotated dataset, and their distribution are shown in Table 5b in the Appendix.\\n\\n5 Models and experiments\\n\\nTo determine the most cost-effective model (both in terms of performance and costs) for our large-scale sociological analysis, we evaluate various models, including Llama-3-70B-Instruct, gpt-4-1106-preview, base and instruction-finetuned gpt-3.5-turbo-0125, across high-level and fine-grained (anti-)solidarity annotation tasks in achieving human-level performance. Once the quality of the models is assured, we apply the best performing model \u2014 GPT-4 \u2014 large-scale to determine trends in Section 7.\\n\\nData\\n\\nWe use a 70/15/15 train/dev/test split for all Migrant and Woman annotated data, which gives us approx. 2000 train, 400 dev and 430 test instances. We ensure reliability of a test set by allocating approximately 40% curated and 45% majority (labels assigned when more than half of annotators agree on the same label) labels. We create 3 random data splits, and calculate performance metrics as the average score of the 3 runs on the test sets.\"}"}

We also calculate the F1 Score for the classes individually. We report these metrics for both high-level and fine-grained tasks.\\n\\n5.1 Models\\n\\nBaseline\\n\\nFor our baseline, we use a BERT-based pipeline with 110M parameters, comprising a high-level category classifier and two subtype models for solidarity and anti-solidarity. All models share a similar architecture, processing inputs with a target (Frau or Migrant) and full text comprising the focus sentence and left and right context. We add a fully connected layer with softmax activation atop the pooled output of the BERT-based models, with 4 output units for each model. To counter class imbalance, minority classes are oversampled to parity with the majority class. We finetune for 20 epochs with a learning rate of 4e-4, a warmup ratio of 0.05, linear decay, AdamW optimizer (Loshchilov and Hutter, 2017) and categorical crossentropy loss.\\n\\nGPT-4\\n\\nWe design two prompts (one for each target group) that include several elements: (i) incorporating chain-of-thought reasoning (Wei et al., 2022) in a few-shot setting by providing examples with desired reasoning and asking to think step by step in a zero-shot setting (Kojima et al., 2022); (ii) providing precise definitions and insights derived from annotation discussions; (iii) introducing definitions and examples of potentially problematic labels (such as empathic solidarity and empathic anti-solidarity) earlier in the prompt and (iv) implementing a two-step prompting strategy that initially categorizes texts at a high-level followed by detailed subtype classification (full prompts are provided in Fig. 16 and Fig. 17 in the Appendix).\\n\\nPrompt-based fine-tuned GPT-3.5\\n\\nUsing the prompt identified for GPT-4\u2019s fine-grained classification, we proceeded to fine-tune GPT-3.5 on instances sampled from our initial train set (114 for migrants; 109 for women), ensuring a balanced distribution across labels. The fine-tuning dataset was structured with the system providing instructions for classifying texts into high-level categories and requesting further sub-categorization; the user GPT-3.5, GPT-4, only test sets are used (also averaged on 3 runs).\\n\\nLlama-3\\n\\nFor an open-source model, we select Llama-3-70B-Instruct with q_k quantization (Meta, 2024), tested in a zero-shot setting. We use the same prompt as detailed in Fig. 16 and Fig. 17 in the Appendix, but involving separate calls for high-level and subcategory classifications.\\n\\nFor all GPT experiments, we test the models in few- (where we include ten category examples in the prompt to demonstrate the desired reasoning and categorization setting) and zero-shot settings.\\n\\n6 Results\\n\\nResults on the test sets are shown in Table 2 and Table 7 in the Appendix.\\n\\nGPT-4 consistently outperforms other models in both fine-grained and high-level tasks for women and migrants. Interestingly, GPT-4 achieves similar performance in zero-shot and few-shot settings \u2013 0.37 (0.60) and 0.37 (0.54) for women, and 0.42 (0.73) and 0.43 (0.63) for migrants, respectively, where the first number represents the fine-grained, and the number in parentheses the high-level score. This might be attributed to the use of carefully crafted definitions, which eliminates the need for additional examples. The fine-tuned version of GPT-3.5 demonstrates only marginal improvement over the base model, generally falling short of GPT-4\u2019s performance. Most importantly, GPT-4 leads in F1 scores across categories, effectively identifying both solidarity and anti-solidarity (0.65 for women and 0.87 for migrants in zero-shot settings, see Table 7 in the Appendix). However, it scores lowest in the mixed stance category, indicating challenges with more complex and ambiguous instances. Llama-3, on the other hand, outperforms GPT-4 in this category for women and also leads in the none category for migrants by better identifying contradicting and subtle cues, likely benefiting from the two-step classification approach.\\n\\nConversely, BERT achieves lower F1 scores across all categories, performing comparably to the GPT-3.5 versions on high-level tasks but struggling with fine-grained tasks and ambivalent categories like mixed stance, likely due to challenges from underrepresented labels such as anti-solidarity categories for women, even after over-sampling (see Fig. 4, as well as Table 5a in the Appendix).\"}"}

We also consider explanations provided by GPT-4.\\n\\nObserved errors align with those noted during human annotation, with solidarity and anti-solidarity rarely confused (1% of cases). Confusion primarily occurs between (anti-)solidarity subtypes and none, as well as mixed stance, as the model seems to look for stronger indications of solidarity despite instructions to consider even slight expressions of it (see examples 1 and 2 in Table 9).\\n\\nThere is also notable confusion between the solidarity subtypes, with the most frequent confusion between group-based and compassionate solidarity, likely because of the presence of multiple category characteristics within the texts (see example 3 in Table 9). There is also confusion between compassionate and empathic solidarity, where the model sometimes misinterprets empathic as merely relating to the term empathy, overlooking the full category definition, which involves respecting diversity, as in example 4 in Table 9.\\n\\nAnalysis\\nIn this section, we analyze how the solidarity discourse in the German parliament developed over 155 years, using automatic, fine-grained annotations from the best-performing model, GPT-4 zero-shot. However, due to cost constraints, we limit the annotations to a) data concerning migrants, i.e., the target group for which our models achieved higher scores and b) a sample of 18,300 instances from the overall 58k instances concerning migrants. We draw the sample proportionally for the time spans in the original data. This selection includes all records with political party information (see Appendix B for details on political parties data extraction and list of parties included in the analysis). The cost of this automatic annotation was around 500 Euro.\\n\\nHow does (anti-)solidarity change over time? As shown in Fig. 5b, throughout the periods analyzed, solidarity consistently surpasses anti-solidarity. From 1880 to 1910, solidarity increased from under 20% to 30%, driven by discussions about Eastern and Central European foreign workers' rights in the context of industrialization and local demographic shifts (Sch\u00f6nw\u00e4lder, 1999). Following the NS regime, solidarity surges above 50%, aligning with the influx of Vertriebene (en.: expellees), who were generally viewed positively in parliamentary debates (Fr\u00f6hlich, 2023), as well as the arrival of Gastarbeiter (en.: guest workers) from the Mediterranean (Stalker, 2000). The highest solidarity and low anti-solidarity in 1940s reflect limited discussions (due to sparse data during this period) skewed towards solidarity, primarily focusing on expellees.\\n\\nAnti-solidarity towards migrants initially rose from about 5% to over 15% between 1870 and 1890, remaining stable until 1920, likely due to fears of \u201cPolonization\u201d from the influx of Polish workers, leading to restrictive policies against perceived threats to German identity (Triadafilopoulos, 2004). From 1960, anti-solidarity resurged with rising anti-migrant sentiments linked to labor migration in the 1960s and 1970s, right-wing opposition to liberal asylum laws in the 1990s (Faist, 2004).\"}"}

By 2022, solidarity stabilizes at around 40%, while anti-solidarity has risen to above 20%. We also note a relative decrease in solidarity compared to anti-solidarity, as shown in Fig. 10 in the Appendix, which illustrates this shift by subtracting the percentage of anti-solidarity from that of solidarity.\\n\\nHow have (anti-)solidarity frames evolved over time? In Fig. 5a, for solidarity (left), it is evident that group-based solidarity (i.e., emphasis on shared national identity and integration) was dominant until the 1990s, peaking to over 50% in 1870 with the founding of the German empire. It drops to below 20% by 1880, surges back above 50% in 1970, and then declines to below 30% by 2020. These trends align with periods of strong German nationalism (around 1870 and pre-World War II) and the influx of expellees in the 1950s and 1960s. For anti-solidarity (right), trends show group-based anti-solidarity dominant before WWII, peaking from 70% to over 90%, then declining to below 60% post-war, reflecting a decline in opposition to migration based on national identity in parliamentary debates after the NS era. Instead, anti-solidarity arguments shifted to exchange-based anti-solidarity (from below 10% to above 40% after World War II), i.e., arguments that migrants are not providing adequate economic contributions. Neither compassionate nor empathic anti-solidarity are frequent at any time. By 2022, group-based solidarity declines, giving way to compassionate solidarity, which rose to above 40%.\\n\\nHow are solidarity and anti-solidarity frames represented across political parties? Our analysis covers the distribution of (anti-)solidarity frames across parties from 1865 to 2022. It should be noted that we assess the data without regard to the specific emergence dates of political parties (e.g., AfD established in 2013 versus SPD in 1863). Data subdivision by the speaker\u2019s party shows that all parties, except for the far-right AfD, mainly exhibit solidarity towards migrants (Fig. 9 in the Appendix, left). Compassionate and group-based solidarity are prevalent, with left-leaning parties (Linke, Gr\u00fcne) showing higher levels of compassionate and empathic solidarity compared to the more exchange-focused solidarity of centrist parties (SPD, FDP, CDU/CSU). Conversely, while the right-wing parties, including CDU/CSU, also engage in anti-solidarity rhetoric, it is AfD that predominantly holds such stances, focusing mainly on exchange-based anti-solidarity that suggests migrants contribute less (see Fig. 9 in the Appendix, right). This distribution mirrors findings in Flanders, Belgium, where radical rightists\u2019 discourse predominantly focuses on group-based frames; greens and social democrats emphasize compassionate solidarity, liberals prefer exchange-based approaches, and both greens and liberals advocate for empathic solidarity, highlighting a polarization of partisan discourse (Thijssen and Verheyen, 2022).\\n\\n8 Concluding remarks This study set out to i) provide a high-quality dataset of (anti-)solidarity annotations in German parliamentary debates, ii) from an NLP perspective, evaluate the ability of LLMs to assist in large-scale social and political analyses over extended periods, and iii) from a CSS perspective, uncover long-term shifts in solidarity trends in Germany,\"}"}
{"id": "emnlp-2024-main-337", "page_num": 9, "content": "{\"primary_language\":\"en\",\"is_rotation_valid\":true,\"rotation_correction\":0,\"is_table\":false,\"is_diagram\":false,\"natural_text\":\"laying groundwork for future sociological studies.\\n\\nConcerning i), we invested 1000+ annotation hours and 18k Euro to provide a data set of 2,864 manually annotated text snippets following the sociological framework of Thijssen (2012).\\n\\nRegarding ii), our findings indicate that GPT-4 outperforms other models (Llama-3-70B, GPT-3.5 base, fine-tuned, and BERT) in reproducing human annotations. While other models demonstrate proficiency in identifying high-level categories, they exhibit limitations in handling more nuanced categories, specific to sociological theory. GPT-4, though challenged by ambiguity, handles complex tasks even in a zero-shot setting.\\n\\nContrary to previous research in CSS that suggested smaller fine-tuned models like BERT performed well (Choi et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2023), our study finds that larger models are more effective our hard CSS task, possibly due to the carefully designed prompts based on human expertise. Our observations align with Ziems et al. (2024), who noted that while LLMs have not yet reached the quality of human analysis in classification tasks within CSS, large instruction-tuned LLMs are preferable. However, we observe that the open-source model Llama-3 exhibits inferior performance compared to the non-open-source GPT-4.\\n\\nIn terms of iii), our analysis of German parliamentary debates from 1865 to 2022 reveals shifts in attitudes toward migrants influenced by labor demands, migration waves, and socio-political changes. The evolution from group-based to compassionate solidarity marks a shift towards economic pragmatism and issues of redistribution in migration discourse, likely spurred by rising global humanitarianism (Vollmer and Karakayali, 2018). Despite traditional solidarity dominance, the resurgence of anti-solidarity since WWII, peaking in 2022, illustrates deepening political polarization. This underscores the ongoing tension between xenophobic tendencies and liberal ideals in Germany (Joppke, 2007; Lehr, 2015), reflecting the complex challenges of integration and multiculturalism in a major migrant destination.\\n\\nThese findings lay a strong foundation for further sociological research using LLMs. Future work could examine how shifts in political discourse impact policy-making and public opinion, exploring correlations with civic solidarity. Comparative studies across countries with varying migration histories may reveal factors influencing (anti-)solidarity. Additionally, exploring the effects of such rhetoric on related policies, like migration or equal opportunity, could yield further insights. From an NLP perspective, future work can explore a broader range of LLMs, including those fine-tuned on German data, and explore the effect of using highlighting and explanations to improve classification.\\n\\nLimitations\\n\\nOur study faces several limitations that should be considered when interpreting the results.\\n\\n\u2022 The task of annotating political speech, particularly concepts such as solidarity and anti-solidarity, poses significant challenges. These concepts are inherently complex and laden with subtleties that are difficult to capture, both for human annotators and automated models.\\n\\n\u2022 Due to resource constraints, GPT-4 was applied to only a portion of the dataset, potentially limiting the generalizability of our findings. Moreover, the proportional sampling of instances across decades might have led to the underrepresentation of certain periods, which could have further impacted the comprehensiveness of the analysis.\\n\\n\u2022 While our analysis of solidarity and anti-solidarity frames distribution across parties covers data from 1865 to 2022 and includes all historical periods, it does not trace the evolution of partisan discourse over time. We assess the data comprehensively without focusing on the specific historical emergence of political parties (e.g., AfD established in 2013 versus SPD in 1863).\\n\\n\u2022 Additional manual annotation features such as free-comment explanations, highlighting, and indications of opposing positions (all available in our human annotation) were not fully explored. These elements hold potential for future studies, which could use them as cues for LLMs to achieve a more nuanced classification.\\n\\nAcknowledgments\\n\\nThis research was funded by the Ministry of Culture and Science of the State of North Rhine-Westphalia under the grant no NW21-059A (SAIL).

Wenn das geschehen ist, werden wir gerne darauf hinwirken, da\u00df das ge\u00e4ndert wird.\\n\\nich m\u00f6chte nur darauf aufmerksam machen, da\u00df aus Ihrer Frage der v\u00f6llig gegenteilige Sinn heraustzulesen war, n\u00e4mlich da\u00df Sie offensichtlich w\u00fcnschten, Ausl\u00e4nder, die in Deutschland Examen ablegen, solchen Diplome in ihrer eigenen Sprache ausgefertigt bekommen, was sicherlich nicht unsere Aufgabe sein kann und auch nicht sehr sinnvoll w\u00e4re.\\n\\nDie Zieglerarbeit ist eine schwere, sogar eine sehr schwere; das wird allgemein anerkannt, auch von allen Gewerbeinspektoren. Es wird deshalb auch ziemlich h\u00e4ufig f\u00fcr w\u00fcnschenswert erkl\u00e4rt, da\u00df die Arbeiterinnen aus diesem Produktionszweige mehr und mehr verdr\u00e4ngt werden. Wir sind sicherlich der Ansicht, da\u00df die Arbeit auf den Ziegeleien im allgemeinen f\u00fcr Frauen nicht geeignet ist. Daher k\u00f6nnen wir uns auch durchaus damit einverstanden erkl\u00e4ren, da\u00df man die Arbeit der Frauen auf den Ziegeleien erheblich eingeschr\u00e4nkt hat. wir w\u00fcnschen, da\u00df man darin weiter fortf\u00e4hrt, auch selbst dann, wenn dadurch vielleicht zun\u00e4chst ein gewisser Widerstand nicht nur bei den Unternehmern, sondern auch sogar bei den Arbeitern selbst erzeugt werden wird. Denn dar\u00fcber sind die Berichte ziemlich einig, da\u00df, wenn die Frauenarbeit nicht erheblich eingeschr\u00e4nkt w\u00fcrde, dann die Frauen gesundheitliche und sittliche Sch\u00e4digungen davontragen.\\n\\nWir w\u00fcnschen das nicht im Interesse der Frauen, wir haben uns mit den Frauenrechtlerinnen noch niemals auf eine Stufe gestellt. Wir w\u00fcnschen das nicht im Namen der Frauen und im Interesse der Frauen, sondern im Gesamtinteresse des deutschen Volkes, weil wir der Meinung sind, da\u00df bei Mitwirkung der Frauen mehr Verst\u00e4ndnis f\u00fcr die Angeklagten und ein sozialerer Geist sich in der Rechtsprechung durchsetzen wird.

Es liegt ja doch wirklich im Interesse der Staaten des Norddeutschen Bundes, da\u00df man diejenigen Ausl\u00e4nder, die uns etwas Gutes bringen k\u00f6nnen, zum Gewerbebetrieb zul\u00e4\u00dft und uns nicht selbst damit straft, da\u00df man die Gewerbetreibenden nicht zul\u00e4\u00dft, in deren Heimath vielleicht noch sehr schlechte Gewerbegesetze existiren.\\n\\nModel\u2019s Explanation: This could be interpreted as exchange-based solidarity to some extent. However, the core of the discussion is legal and pragmatic, rather than being based on an ethos of solidarity or anti-solidarity as defined. It is important to note that without the broader context of the discussion or the surrounding text, it is difficult to ascertain the overall stance regarding migrants beyond this specific legislative detail.\\n\\n(3) Gold standard: compassionate solidarity towards women\\nPredicted label: group-based solidarity\\n\\nWir werden es nicht zulassen, dass k\u00fcnftig ausl\u00e4ndische Ehefrauen vier Jahre in unzumutbaren Ehen verharren, um nicht aus Deutschland ausgewiesen zu werden. Das werden Sie nicht erreichen. Ich will es \u00fcberhaupt nicht verhehlen: Wir haben noch unendlich viel zu tun, bevor wir gerade im Erwerbsleben und bei der traditionellen Rollen- und Aufgabenverteilung eine faktische Gleichstellung von Frauen und M\u00e4nnern erreicht haben.\\n\\nModel\u2019s Explanation: The most fitting subtype of solidarity in this context is GROUP-BASED SOLIDARITY because the text discusses the collective responsibility to promote equality and the shared efforts needed to achieve substantial change in societal structures concerning the roles and treatment of women.\\n\\n(4) Gold standard: compassionate solidarity towards women\\nPredicted label: empathic solidarity\\n\\nWenn man von den Leuten fordert, da\u00df sie sich anmelden sollen, wenn alle m\u00f6glichen Einschr\u00e4nkungen f\u00fcr den Aufenthalt getroffen werden, soll man diese Ausl\u00e4nder auch wissen lassen, nach welchen Vorschriften sie sich zu richten haben. Es ist schikan\u00f6s und heimt\u00fcckisch, die Leute mit solchen Vorschriften zu \u00fcberfallen. Wie das in der Praxis vor sich geht, brauche ich Ihnen nicht lange zu schildern.\\n\\nModel\u2019s Explanation: The text seems to transmit a sense of EMPATHIC SOLIDARITY because it addresses the unfairness and challenges that foreigners face and advocates for fairness and clear guidelines, which shows a degree of empathy for their situation.\"}"}

On this occasion, I would like to ask the Reich government whether it is true that the Foreign Office has granted ten Russians the right to issue entry permit certificates to Germany. We demand the strictest control of foreigners. However, based on what I have just reported, such control would naturally be illusory.\\n\\nThe text does not display solidarity with or anti-solidarity against asylum seekers in the context of promoter solidarity or anti-solidarity subtypes as defined. It seems to be merely stating the situation as a matter of fact without expressing a clear stance towards the asylum seekers.\\n\\nThe text is critical of a policy deemed detrimental to promoting women's full participation in the workforce and calls for action rather than mere discussion.
