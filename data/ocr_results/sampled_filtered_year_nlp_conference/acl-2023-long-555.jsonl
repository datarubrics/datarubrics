Our findings provide key implications for the use of LMs to assist people in overcoming negative thoughts.\\n\\n1 Introduction\\n\\nNegative thoughts are a natural part of human cognition. However, for people experiencing mental health challenges, such thoughts are often entrenched, automatic and emotionally triggering, making it difficult to overcome them in-the-moment (Beck, 1976). An evidence-based, well-established therapeutic intervention to overcome negative thoughts is Cognitive Reframing, in which a negative thought is replaced with a more hopeful \\\"reframed thought,\\\" which offers an alternative perspective on one's situation (Beck, 1976). For example, imagine a person with a situation \\\"I'm submitting a research paper to ACL 2023\\\" has a thought \\\"This paper is going to get rejected.\\\" A possible way to reframe this thought is to say \\\"This paper has some chance of getting accepted due to its novel methodology and potential impact.\\\" Psychotherapy research suggests that for a reframed thought to be effective, it must be (a) relatable to the individual, (b) helpful in overcoming the negative thought and (c) memorable to be accessible the next time a similar thought arises (Beck, 1976; Burns, 1980). However, understanding what characterizes a relatable, helpful and memorable reframe is challenging and unknown. Professional therapists can support people in coming up with such highly effective reframed thoughts. However, barriers like clinician shortages, lack of insurance coverage and stigma commonly limit access to therapists (Olfson, 2016; Sickel et al., 2014). NLP-based methods that assist individuals in reframing negative thoughts, in-the-moment, may provide scaffolding that is easier to engage with and that could be made widely accessible.\\n\\nPrior NLP research has developed methods for a range of text reframing tasks like sentiment and empathy rewriting (Reif et al., 2022; Sharma et al., 2021) and more recently, positive reframing (Ziems et al., 2022). However, little is known about how to develop cognitive reframing methods that automatically generate relatable, helpful and memorable reframed thoughts.\\n\\nIn this paper, we conduct a study of how language models can be used to reframe negative thoughts (Figure 1). We study ways in which a negative thought can be reframed, how LMs can be utilized to perform this reframing and what types of reframes are preferred by people who experience negative thoughts.\"}"}

Here, we propose a framework of seven reframing attributes (see gray box). Given a reframed thought, we control each attribute (e.g., actionability) to generate reframes that score higher or lower on that attribute (e.g., more or less actionable); we deploy this model on Mental Health America, a large U.S. national mental health website (bit.ly/changing-thoughts) and conduct a randomized field study with 2,067 participants. We suggest LM-generated reframes to MHA visitors and assess which reframing attributes are desirable and what constitutes a relatable, helpful and memorable reframe.\u201d\\n\\n\u201cWe develop a new conceptual framework for characterizing the ways in which a thought might be reframed. We synthesize the most prominent cognitive reframing processes used in therapy and define seven linguistic attributes of reframed thoughts: whether the reframe addresses \u201cthinking traps\u201d (faulty or distorted patterns of thinking), whether it is rational, positive, empathic, actionable, specific and readable. Building on prior research, we develop automated metrics to measure these attributes and establish construct validity by correlating them with judgements from mental health practitioners.\u201d\\n\\n\u201c\u2026\u201d\\n\\nNext, to develop models for the cognitive reframing task, we collect and share a dataset from mental health practitioners and clinical psychology graduate students. The dataset includes 600 situations and thoughts with expert-suggested reframes as well as annotations of the proposed reframing attributes. Using this dataset, we develop a retrieval-enhanced in-context learning method (Brown et al., 2020) to generate reframed thoughts and to control their linguistic attributes. We show that this method achieves the highest overlap with expert-suggested reframes and the highest relatability and helpfulness ratings based on evaluation from mental health experts, when compared to popular NLP baselines.\u201d\\n\\n\u201cWe investigate which reframing attributes are desirable and what constitutes a relatable, helpful and memorable reframe. In collaboration (and co-authorship) with mental health experts, and after appropriate ethical review, we deploy a month-long randomized field study on Mental Health America (MHA; a popular website that shares mental health resources and tools online), with 2,067 participants with informed consent. We ask MHA visitors to describe situations and negative thoughts they are experiencing and then suggest LM-generated reframed thoughts with varying linguistic attributes. We find that highly specific and highly empathic reframing is the most preferred and highly specific and actionable reframing is considered the most helpful and memorable. However, we find that reframes that are highly positive are less preferred.\u201d\"}"}

Here, we aim to understand what constitutes successful reframing and how language models can assist people in this process. Towards this goal, we characterize the linguistic attributes of reframed thoughts (\u00a73), collect a dataset of situations, thoughts and reframes (\u00a74), develop methods to generate reframes and to measure and control their attributes (\u00a75; \u00a76) and investigate which linguistic attributes are related to the reframing outcomes of relatability, helpfulness and memorability (\u00a77).\\n\\n3 Framework of Linguistic Attributes of Reframed Thoughts\\n\\nWe draw from clinical therapy practices and collaborate with mental health experts (some of whom are co-authors) to develop a framework of linguistic attributes of reframed thoughts. We illustrate these attributes with the following example for all reframes below \u2013 Situation: \\\"I submitted a research paper and it got rejected;\\\" Thought: \\\"I'll never succeed as a researcher.\\\"\\n\\nAddressing Thinking Traps.\\n\\nNegative thinking often falls into common patterns, called \\\"thinking traps.\\\" Also called cognitive distortions, these include exaggerated and biased patterns of thinking which cause individuals to perceive reality inaccurately (Beck, 1976; Ding et al., 2022). Common thinking traps include: assuming what others think (\\\"Mind reading\\\"), thinking in extremes (\\\"All-or-nothing thinking\\\"), focusing on the worst-case scenario (\\\"Catastrophizing\\\"), trying to predict the future (\\\"Fortune telling\\\"), etc. See Appendix D for the full list.\\n\\nA reframe may or may not directly address one or more of the thought's thinking traps. A reframe like \\\"I don't know what the future will bring\\\" directly addresses the thinking trap \\\"Fortune telling,\\\" whereas a reframe like \\\"I will surely become a successful researcher\\\" does not address this thinking trap but rather continues to express it.\\n\\nRationality.\\n\\nAnother strategy to reframe a thought is to reflect on evidence for and against it and reason about what these evidence imply (Beck, 1976). For example, the rejection of the paper is evidence of having the thought \\\"I'll never succeed as a researcher.\\\" However, the evidence against this thought could be that acceptance or rejection of one paper does not make someone a failure, which may lead to a reframe \\\"Just getting one paper rejected doesn't define my failure.\\\" A rational reframe is guided by such strong evidence whereas an irrational reframe is based on unrealistic assumptions.\\n\\nPositivity.\\n\\nA reframe of a negative thought tries to emphasize the positive perspectives of the situation but different reframes may have different levels of positivity. An overly positive reframe like \\\"I'm going to win best paper awards for every paper from now on\\\" exaggerates the positive perspectives, which is likely to set the person up for disappointment rather than success (Dember and Penwell, 1980). On the other hand, a balanced response like \\\"I may or may not succeed, but I'll keep trying\\\" considers both positive and negative perspectives of the situation.\\n\\nEmpathy.\\n\\nIt can be helpful to acknowledge the feelings caused by negative thoughts (Allen and Leary, 2010; Elliott et al., 2011). A reframe may express empathy or self-compassion by validating how one is feeling. E.g., \\\"It is okay to feel disappointed when a paper gets rejected.\\\"\\n\\nActionability.\\n\\nTo encourage pleasant emotions, one commonly used therapeutic approach is Behavioral Activation (Dimidjian et al., 2011; Burkhardt et al., 2021). This involves engaging in behaviors or actions that may help in overcoming negative thoughts. A reframe may suggest specific actions (e.g., \\\"I can take the feedback I received and use it to improve my paper\\\"), may not suggest specific actions but be actionable (e.g., \\\"I can use this experience to learn and grow\\\") or may not be actionable at all (e.g., \\\"I may or may not become a successful researcher\\\").\\n\\nSpecificity.\\n\\nA reframe may specifically address the situation and the thought (e.g., \\\"One paper rejection doesn't define my failure as a researcher\\\") or may be generic enough to be applicable to a wide range of negative situations and thoughts (e.g., \\\"I'm going to succeed\\\"). While a specific reframe may be more helpful in-the-moment, a generic reframe could be effective for recurring thoughts, which are frequently a result of the \\\"core\\\" beliefs that a person holds (Beck, 2005; David et al., 2009).\\n\\nReadability.\\n\\nThe linguistic reasoning capabilities of individuals may be different (e.g., across age groups or education levels) (Kaplan et al., 1995). Accordingly, a reframe may either be simple or complex to read (e.g., \\\"I'll do well in the future\\\" vs. \\\"I'll do well in the future\\\").\"}"}

This dataset contains hypothetical and real-world situations, thoughts and emotional processes reported by crowdworkers on Amazon Mechanical Turk. We manually curate 180 pairs of diverse situations with negative thoughts from this dataset.\\n\\nMental Health America (MHA). Situations and thoughts from crowdworkers may not reflect the broad range of mental health challenges that people face in real-life. To incorporate more real-world situations and thoughts, we ran a survey on the MHA website (screening.mhanational.org). MHA visitors (who typically use the website for screening of mental illnesses) were asked to describe any negative thoughts and the associated situations they were struggling with. We manually curate 120 pairs of self-reported situations and thoughts to ensure broad coverage of relevant topics based on high diversity and manual filtering.\\n\\n4.2 Annotation Task and Procedure\\n\\nReframing negative thoughts is a cognitively difficult process that requires practice and training, making crowdwork data collection approaches challenging. To ensure high-quality reframes and annotations, we recruit 15 current mental health practitioners and clinical psychology graduate students with significant practical experience in cognitive reframing.\\n\\nFor each (situation, thought) pair in our data source (\u00a74.1), we ask them to (1) write two different reframed thoughts, (2) annotate the thinking traps addressed by each reframed thought and (3) compare the two reframes and choose the one that is more rational, more positive, more actionable, more empathic, more specific and more readable. In total, we collect 600 reframed thoughts with annotations on their linguistic attributes. We share this dataset publicly at github.com/behavioral-data/Cognitive-Reframing.\\n\\n4.3 Ethics and Safety\\n\\nOur data collection and randomized field study (\u00a77) were designed and conducted after review of potential benefits and risks to participants in consultation and collaboration with mental health experts. Both studies were approved by the University of Washington's Institutional Review Board and informed participants about study purpose, risks and data collection. All participants were 18 or older, provided informed consent and were given access to a crisis hotline. We do not assess any clinical outcomes. See \u00a710 for an extended discussion of ethical and safety considerations.\\n\\n5 Method\\n\\nWe design automated metrics for measuring linguistic attributes (\u00a75.1), develop methods to generate reframed thoughts (\u00a75.2) and to control their attributes (\u00a75.3).\\n\\n5.1 Measuring Reframing Attributes\\n\\nAddressing Thinking Traps. Given a situation \\\\( S_i \\\\), a negative thought \\\\( T_i \\\\) and a reframed thought \\\\( R_i \\\\), our goal is to identify the set of thinking traps addressed by the reframed thought. We approach this as a multi-label classification task, and fine-tune a GPT-3 model on the expert-annotated thinking trap labels collected in \u00a74.2.\\n\\nRationality. Rationality is the quality of being guided by reasons (Damielson et al., 2004). Here, we operationalize rationality of a reframed thought \\\\( R_i \\\\) as its reasoning strength and ask the following two questions: (1) What might be the reasoning behind \\\\( R_i \\\\)?; (2) Are the reasons sound? To understand the reasoning behind \\\\( R_i \\\\), we develop an abductive explanation based method (Peirce, 1974; Bhagavatula et al., 2020; Jung et al., 2022). For a given \\\\((S_i, T_i)\\\\), we use a language model to generate (a) the most plausible explanations that support \\\\( R_i \\\\) and (b) the most plausible explanations that refute it. Moreover, to check if the explanations are sound, we recursively generate explanations behind the explanations to test their reasoning strength (Appendix E). Let \\\\( \\\\text{sup}(\\\\cdot) \\\\) be a generator function that generates explanation supporting a reframe and let \\\\( \\\\text{ref}(\\\\cdot) \\\\) be a generator function that generates explanation refuting a reframe.\\n\\nMoreover, to check if the explanations are sound, we recursively generate explanations behind the explanations to test their reasoning strength (Appendix E).

We use text-davinci-003 as our GPT-3 model for all experiments in this paper.\"}"}

This RoBERTa-based model leverages a theoretically-grounded framework of empathy consisting of three empathy communication mechanisms (emotional reactions, interpretations and explorations) and predicts empathy levels in mental health conversations on a scale from 0 to 6. Here, we further fine-tune this model on the domain of reframed thoughts through a manually labeled dataset of 300 reframed thoughts with empathy labels (labeled by one author with expertise in empathy in mental health context).\\n\\nTo measure actionability, we hypothesize that an actionable reframe is one that either (1) suggests a concrete action or (2) does not suggest a concrete action but is easy to act upon. We cast action concreteness as a binary classification task: given reframe $R_i$, predict $contains_action(R_i) \\\\in \\\\{0, 1\\\\}$. We make few-shot predictions by prompting GPT-3 with 10 examples of reframed thoughts paired with actionability ratings from \u00a74.2 (details in Appendix A.1).\\n\\nTo determine the ease with which $R_i$ can be acted upon, we examine the next set of actions entailed by $R_i$. Our hypothesis is that a diverse next action set may indicate ambiguity which might be less actionable, whereas a coherent next action set may indicate clarity which might be more actionable. Here, we instruct GPT-3 to generate $k = 5$ next action candidates given a reframed thought (instruction prompting; zero-shot). We compute the next action coherence \u2014 denoted $next_{action}_{coherence}(R_i)$ \u2014 by embedding each of the $k$ action candidates using RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019) and computing the average pairwise cosine similarity. Higher similarity indicates greater coherence among the possible next actions. Our overall actionability measurement is defined as $contains_action(R_i) + next_{action}_{coherence}(R_i)$.\\n\\nSpecificity. Following prior work (Xu et al., 2018; Sharma et al., 2021), we measure specificity using sentence embedding similarity between the reframed thought $R_i$ and the concatenation of the situation $S_i$ and the thought $T_i$ (using RoBERTa embeddings (Liu et al., 2019)).\\n\\nReadability. We employ the commonly used Coleman-Liau Index (CLI) metric (Coleman and Liau, 1975) which assesses readability based on the character and word structure within a sentence. The Coleman-Liau Index is calculated as $0.0588L - 0.296S - 15.8$, where $L$: average number of letters per 100 words; $S$ is the average number of sentences per 100 words.\\n\\n5.2 Reframe Generation\\n\\nIn-context learning methods can learn to generalize NLP tasks from a handful of examples (few-shot learning) or from hand-written instructions alone (instruction prompting) (Brown et al., 2020). However, through a qualitative analysis of 100 manually written situations and thoughts, we found that a simple in-context learning method with a fixed set of examples often failed to appropriately reframe situations and thoughts for which no relevant in-context examples were provided (e.g., someone with anxiety having \\\"racing thoughts\\\").\\n\\nTo appropriately reframe thoughts related to a range of situations and thoughts, we develop a retrieval-based in-context learning method (Liu et al., 2022b). For each situation $S_i$ and negative thought $T_i$, we retrieve $k$-similar examples from our dataset (\u00a74). We first encode situations and thoughts using RoBERTa embeddings. Then, we retrieve $k$ examples, $\\\\{(s_1, t_1), \\\\ldots, (s_k, t_k)\\\\}$,\"}"}

Here, we intend to vary the linguistic attributes of the reframes.\\n\\nA reframed thought may or may not address a thinking trap in the original thought $T_i$. Here, we generate two reframes $R_i(\\\\text{tt}, Y)$ and $R_i(\\\\text{tt}, N)$, one that addresses the thinking traps in $T_i$ and another that does not address it.\\n\\nWe extract two separate sets of in-context examples from our dataset \u2013 those that address at least one thinking trap and those that do not (as collected in \u00a74). We use those examples to prompt GPT-3 to generate $R_i(\\\\text{tt}, Y)$ and $R_i(\\\\text{tt}, N)$.\\n\\nMoreover, a reframed thought may have high or low rationality, positivity, empathy, actionability, specificity and readability values. For these six attributes, given a reframe $R_i$ and a linguistic attribute $a$, we generate two additional reframes $R_i(a, H)$ and $R_i(a, L)$, one that scores higher on attribute $a$ and another that scores lower on it (e.g., higher or lower actionability). To accomplish this, recall that each (situation, thought) pair from \u00a74.2 is annotated with two reframes and that the reframes are compared along each linguistic attribute.\\n\\nFor a human-annotated instance $j$, let $R_j^*(a, H)$ and $R_j^*(a, L)$ be the reframes judged to be high and low on attribute $a$, respectively. To generate $R_i(a, H)$ from $R_i$, we prompt GPT-3 with in-context examples $\\\\{R_j^*(a, L) \\\\rightarrow R_j^*(a, H)\\\\}_{k_j=1}$, using $k_j=5$.\\n\\n6 Experiments and Results\\n\\nWe assess the construct validity of proposed linguistic attributes (\u00a76.1) and evaluate the performance of the reframe generation model (\u00a76.2).\\n\\n6.1 Construct Validity of Linguistic Attributes\\n\\nWe validate our proposed linguistic attribute measures by correlating them with the human judgments of mental health experts, as obtained in \u00a74.2. We find a strong Pearson correlation for addressing thinking traps (0.680***) and actionability (0.647***), a moderate correlation for rationality (0.448**), positivity (0.550***), empathy (0.575***) and specificity (0.427**), and a weak correlation for readability (0.331*) (Table 1).\\n\\n6.2 Reframe Generation Performance\\n\\nWe use both automatic and human evaluation to assess the performance of our proposed reframe generation model as developed in \u00a75.2.\\n\\n### Table 2: Automatic and Human Evaluation Results.

Highly empathic and specific reframings are preferred more. We find that highly empathic reframes are preferred 55.7% more frequently than reframes with lower empathy (39.7% vs. 25.5%; $p < 10^{-5}$); highly specific reframes are preferred 43.1% more frequently than reframes with lower specificity (39.2% vs. 27.4%; $p < 10^{-5}$). Prior work has shown the importance of empathy and less \u201ctemplated\u201d responses in mental health support conversations (Sharma et al., 2020b; Althoff et al., 2016). Here, we show that empathy and specificity of LM-generated reframes may support people in reframing negative thoughts.\\n\\n2. Overly positive reframes are preferred less. On the other hand, reframes with high positivity are preferred 22.7% less frequently than reframes with lower positivity (29.6% vs. 38.3%; $p < 10^{-5}$). This may be because adopting an overly positive re-framed thought may be challenging for individuals who are already experiencing emotionally triggering negative thoughts (Dember and Penwell, 1980).\\n\\nParticipants also prefer medium-readability reframes over very simple or very complex reframes, perhaps because their language is balanced for a wider audience.\\n\\n7.3 How do the linguistic attributes of reframed thoughts relate to the desired outcomes of cognitive reframing? We assess what characterizes a reframe that is relatable, helpful and memorable.

Reframes that address thinking traps are 6.3% more helpful than reframes that do not address them (3.39 vs. 3.19; \\\\( p < 0.01 \\\\)). Such reframes specifically challenge the cognitive biases in thinking patterns (e.g., \\\"Fortune Telling\\\"; Appendix D), which has shown to be more effective in dealing with negative thoughts in psychotherapy research (Beck, 1976; Burns, 1980). Moreover, we find that reframes with higher actionability are 6.6% more helpful than lower actionability reframes (3.41 vs. 3.20; \\\\( p < 0.05 \\\\)) and reframes with higher specificity are 9.6% more helpful than lower specificity reframes (3.42 vs. 3.12; \\\\( p < 0.01 \\\\)).\\n\\n(3) Reframes that are more actionable and more specific are more memorable.

Our work provides insights on how Human-LM interaction may directly support people struggling with mental health challenges through cognitive reframing. Computational work on cognitive reframing has relied on small-scale crowdsourcing studies (Smith et al., 2021; Morris et al., 2015). Our work develops scalable methods for cognitive reframing and conducts a randomized field study on a large mental health platform. Prior text reframing research has developed methods for related tasks including style, sentiment, politeness and empathy transfer (Reif et al., 2022; Madaan et al., 2020; Sharma et al., 2021) as well as positive reframing (Ziems et al., 2022). Our work develops text-reframing methods for cognitive reframing and demonstrates that linguistic attributes of addressing thinking traps, rationality, actionability, specificity and readability are critical to high-quality reframes. More broadly, our work relates to the growing body of research in NLP for mental health and psychological well-being (Althoff et al., 2016; Sharma and De Choudhury, 2018; Gaur et al., 2019; Lee et al., 2019; Miner et al., 2019; Pendse et al., 2019; P\u00e9rez-Rosas et al., 2019; Pruksachatkun et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2019a; Jaidka et al., 2020; Saha and Sharma, 2020; Sharma et al., 2020a,b; Wadden et al., 2021; Welch et al., 2020; Zhang and Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil, 2020; Lahnala et al., 2021; Lin et al., 2022; Naseem et al., 2022; P\u00e9rez-Rosas et al., 2022; Shah et al., 2022; Shen et al., 2022; Stewart et al., 2023).\\n\\n9 Conclusion\\n\\nIn this paper, we conducted a study of how Human-Language Model Interaction may support humans in the cognitive reframing of negative thoughts. We define a framework of seven linguistic attributes of cognitive reframing, develop automatic metrics to measure these attributes and validate their measurements with mental health experts. We collect and share a dataset of 600 situations, thoughts and reframes from mental health experts and use it to train a retrieval-enhanced in-context learning model based on GPT-3. We deploy this model on the Mental Health America website and conduct a randomized field study with 2,067 participants. We find that people struggling with negative thoughts prefer reframes that are highly empathic or specific, but do not prefer reframes that are highly positive.\\n\\n10 Ethics Statement\\n\\nIntervention in high-risk settings such as mental health necessitates ethical considerations related to safety, privacy and bias. There is a possibility that, in attempting to assist, AI may have the opposite effect on people struggling with mental health challenges. Here, in active collaboration and consultation with mental health professionals and clinical psychologists, we took several measures to minimize these risks.\\n\\nIRB Approval. We obtained approval from the University of Washington's Institutional Review Board for both our data collection (IRB ID STUDY00015882) as well as the randomized field study (IRB ID STUDY00016783). Our organization requires all research personnel who conduct human subjects research to complete human subjects protection training using the online CITI...\"}"}

All participants were 18 years of age and older. Participants were informed that they will be interacting with an AI-based model that automatically generates reframed thoughts and is not monitored by a human. Also, they were informed about the possibility that some of the generated content may be upsetting or disturbing.\\n\\nCrisis Resources.\\n\\nWe made it very explicit that the model should not be used as a \u201ccry for help\u201d outlet and should not be used in cases of suicidal ideation and self-harm. Also, we provided two crisis resources \u2013 Crisis Text Line (crisistextline.org) and 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline (988lifeline.org) \u2013 to our participants at the start of the study.\\n\\nSafety Measures.\\n\\nTo minimize harmful LM-generated reframings, we filtered out any response that contained suicidal ideation or self-harm-related words or phrases. For this, we created a list of 50 regular expressions (e.g., to identify phrases like \u201cfeeling suicidal\u201d, \u201cwish to die\u201d, \u201charm myself\u201d) using suicidal risk assessment lexicons such as Gaur et al. (2019). An LM-generated response that matched any of the regular expressions was filtered out and not shown to the participants. Also, participants were given an option to flag inappropriate reframing suggestions through a \u201cFlag inappropriate\u201d button (Appendix C).\\n\\nPrivacy.\\n\\nWe did not collect any privately identifiable information in our randomized field study and removed any user identifiers before conducting our data analysis. All research data was stored within a separate secure computing environment and only trained research personnel were provided access to data. The situations and thoughts collected in \u00a74.1 went through an anonymization process, where we manually removed any user identifiers and replaced any specific identifiable information including locations, names, etc. with their more general version, following Matthews et al. (2017).\\n\\n11 Limitations\\n\\nWe conducted our randomized field study on a single platform (Mental Health America) and in a single language (English). However, MHA is a particularly popular source for mental health resources with over ten million yearly visitors. In addition, we note that a range of socio-cultural factors might influence how negative thoughts should be reframed and how LMs assisting this process should be developed. Conducting studies on specific communities, including underrepresented communities and minorities, was beyond the scope of this research. Ensuring equitable access of these tools and adapting them to various socio-cultural contexts requires further investigation.\\n\\nNot all cognitive reframing implementations elicit situations, but we believed it was essential for making the reframe personally relatable. In the future, when an individual uses the system for multiple situations and thoughts, it would be interesting to study how their context can be learned more effectively over time. Due to privacy concerns, we presently do not gather information to link multiple sessions. However, with appropriate ethical considerations and user consent, this approach may be beneficial.\\n\\nOur focus in this paper was primarily on creating an intervention that is effective in-the-moment. This was motivated by recent clinical psychology research that suggests that such single-session, in-the-moment interventions can lead to significant positive long-term mental health outcomes (Schleider et al., 2022). To integrate a partial longer-term perspective, we assessed the memorability of a reframe, which may be essential for future utility. Nevertheless, evaluating long-term outcomes is critical and forms an important future research direction. Finally, we emphasize that our study does not investigate short-term or long-term clinical outcomes.\\n\\nAcknowledgements\\n\\nWe are grateful to the mental health practitioners and clinical psychology graduate students for data annotation, as well as the MHA visitors for participating in our field study.

Using the reframed thoughts that were annotated as high or low actionable in our collected data (\u00a74.2), we manually create 10 demonstration examples. If a reframed thought contains an action, we ask GPT-3 to extract the action from it. Otherwise, we ask it to generate the text \\\"No Action\\\". Appendix A.2 shows examples. We then use these 10 demonstrations as in-context examples, followed by the reframe which we aim to classify. If GPT-3 predicts an action for \\\\( R_i \\\\), we assign \\\\( R_i \\\\) containing action = 1; else we assign 0.\\n\\nFor \\\\( R_i \\\\) next action coherence, we instruct GPT-3 to generate \\\\( k = 5 \\\\) possible next actions given a reframed thought. Given \\\\( (S_i, T_i, R_i) \\\\), let \\\\( A_i = a_{i1}, a_{i2}, ..., a_{ik} \\\\) be the generated set of next actions. Let \\\\( \\\\text{emb} \\\\) denote RoBERTa embeddings. Then, we define \\\\( R_i \\\\) next action coherence as the average cosine similarity between \\\\( \\\\text{emb}(a_i) \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\text{emb}(a_j) \\\\) for all \\\\( a_i, a_j \\\\in A_i \\\\).\\n\\nA.2 Action Generation Prompt\\n\\nWe use the following prompt template for extracting actions through GPT-3:\\n\\nStatement: \\\"My bank card could be in many different places and I want to check them first before making any conclusions\\\"\\nProposed Action: \\\"Check bank card.\\\"\\n\\nStatement: \\\"I cancelled that trip because I had to. It hurts to have done so but it was the right thing\\\"\\nProposed Action: None\\n\\nAlso, we use the following instruction prompt for generating the next set of actions through GPT-3: \\\"Suggest 5 actions that the person could take based on the following statement:\\\"\\n\\nA.3 Hyperparameter Choices for our Proposed Retrieval-Enhanced In-Context Learning Method\\n\\nFor the number of examples to retrieve, we experimented with \\\\( k = 1, 5, 10, 20 \\\\) and found \\\\( k = 5 \\\\) to generate the most effective reframed thoughts, based on a qualitative assessment of 100 manually written situations and thoughts.\\n\\nB Reproducibility\\n\\nCodes and datasets created in the paper can be found at https://github.com/behavioral-data/Cognitive-Reframing under an academic, attribution-only license. The use of existing artifacts was consistent with their intended use. For GPT-3 based models, we will use the OpenAI library. For other deep learning models, we train and them on two NVIDIA Titan RTX GPUs. We use the evaluate python library (pypi.org/project/evaluate) for measuring BLEU and ROUGE scores and scipy for statistical tests.\\n\\nC Flagged Reframes\\n\\nThere were 32 reframing suggestions out of 5,760 which were flagged (0.56%). 19 of them were generic (59%). 5 of them made incorrect assumptions about the person's situation (16%). And 8 of them may not have been relatable to the person (25%). Importantly, we did not find any flagged reframes that were harmful or unsafe, which is critical in these scenarios. In future, exploring ways to create more personalized reframes could help avoid generic, assumptive or less relatable reframes.\"}"}
