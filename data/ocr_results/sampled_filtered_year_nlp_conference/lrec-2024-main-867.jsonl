It is the official language of Goa state from the Indian subcontinent. Currently there is a lack of idioms corpus in the low-resource Konkani language. This paper aims to improve the progress in idiomatic sentence identification in order to enhance linguistic processing by creating the first corpus for idioms in the Konkani language. We select a unique list of 1597 idioms from multiple sources and proceed with a strictly controlled sentence creation procedure through crowdsourcing. This is followed by quality check of the sentences and annotation procedure by the experts in the Konkani language. We were able to build a good quality corpus comprising of 6520 sentences written in the Devanagari script of Konkani language. Analysis of the collected idioms and their usage in the created sentences revealed the dominance of selective domains like 'human body' in the creation and occurrences of idiomatic expressions in the Konkani language. This corpus is made publicly available.\\n\\nKeywords: Idioms, Corpus, Konkani\\n\\n1. Introduction\\n\\nIdiomatic expressions are sensed with a different semantic meaning as compared to the meaning of the individual words in the expression. The nature of these expressions has posed a challenge to natural language processing systems. With the onset of deep learning methods, data has played an important part in simplifying the processing related to idioms in the sentences. To counter the problem of idiomatic sense processing, multiple datasets have been developed in high-resource languages like English. Some of the recent idiom related corpus in English language such as the MAGPIE corpus consist of more than 50000 sentences (Haagsma et al, 2020). Although a large number of datasets consisting of idiomatic expressions are available in languages like English, a corresponding corpus in low-resource languages like Konkani are missing. Konkani is a language spoken by over 2.5 million speakers in the western coast of the Indian subcontinent (Registrar General and Census Commissioner-census, 2011). This language has been under-resourced, with regard to the availability of digital resources in the language. There is no idioms related corpus developed for the Konkani language till date, to our knowledge. In this paper we aim to create a new corpus that incorporates a large range of idioms in the Konkani language. Our goal is to provide a ground for training and testing idiomatic sentences in Konkani language for the purpose of idiomatic sense identification and processing in order to enhance the natural language processing research in the Konkani language. This corpus is primarily intended for the task of automatic idiom recognition. This task is further intended to be used to improve the efficiency of Konkani to English language machine translations. This corpus can be used as a fine-tuning dataset for large language models to create applications like idiom-suggestion for Konkani language essay writing. This corpus will also act as a preliminary dataset for fine-tuning the language model for the automatic extraction of idiomatic sentences from a corpus in order to create a larger dataset of idioms in Konkani.\\n\\nCrowdsourcing as a method for corpus creation has been used by MAGPIE corpus (Haagsma et al., 2020). This study made the workers annotate the data from the British National Corpus (BNC, Consortium et al., 2007) as the base dataset through the use of an interface. In this paper we have used a crowdsourcing approach for the creation of sentences from scratch as there are no related resources in the Konkani language available to our knowledge that can be used as a base dataset to extract remarkable number of instances containing idiomatic expressions. We further use a combined approach, where experts guide our crowdsourced work adding quality to the dataset. The corpus is termed as the \\\"Konidioms Corpus\\\" standing for Konkani language idioms corpus. The main contributions of this paper include the following:\\n\\n\u2022 Describes the construction of the first (to our knowledge) dataset of idioms in the Konkani language.\\n\u2022 Provides analysis of frequency and usage distribution of the idioms in the Konidioms corpus that can reflect the overall pattern of idiomatic expressions in the language.\\n\u2022 Provides analysis of the domain distribution of idiomatic expressions as well as sentences in the Konidioms corpus.\\n\u2022 Provides an insight into the benefits, limitations and difficulties of using a combined approach of crowdsourcing and expert annotations for the creation and annotation of the Konidioms corpus.\\n\\nThis paper is divided into six sections beginning with the introduction that describes our motivation to create the dataset and our major contributions through this research. This is followed by the section on related work that mentions the current research with regard to idioms dataset, including the corresponding existing benchmarks and datasets in other languages. We further describe the process and experience of the corpus creation in the 'Method' section. This is followed by the section on 'Konidioms Corpus' where we mention the dimensions and the details of the created corpus. In the next section we proceed with the frequency and domain analysis of...\"}"}

Related Work\\n\\nThe availability of rich base corpus branching out into different genres in the high-resource English language has led to major work in creation of corpus containing idiomatic expressions. This work mainly focused on the extraction of sentences from the base corpus to create a new corpus rich in the usage of the idiomatic expressions. The overall dimensions of the existing idiomatic corpus and their creation and extraction process is discussed briefly in this section.\\n\\nSome of the recent idiom related datasets in English language include the following:\\n\\n\u2022 IDIX Corpus - For the creation of IDIX corpus (Sporleder et al., 2010) worked on the extraction of 4022 idiomatic phrases from the British National Corpus (BNC, Consortium et al., 2007) using a select list of idioms. The extraction process involved pattern comparison, followed by manual supervision.\\n\\n\u2022 The Potential Idiomatic Expression \u2013 PIE dataset (Haagsma et al., 2019) consists of around 20 thousand samples that were divided into 10 multiword classes.\\n\\n\u2022 'SemEval 2013 Task 5b' (Korkontzelos et al., 2013) provided the dataset with 4350 instances from UkWac (Ferraresi et al., 2008) base corpus for 65 different types of idioms. The instances in this corpus were annotated using labels - literal, idiomatic, both, unpredictable.\\n\\n\u2022 PARSEM shared task dataset (Savary et al., 2017) - Carried out verbal multi-word expression annotation (with idiomatic expressions as a subset) for 18 languages that were divided into 4 groups - Balto-Slavic, Germanic, Romance and Others. The created corpora included 4.5 million tokens for training, out of which 52,724 were annotated as 'verbal multi-word expressions' and 900 thousand tokens for testing out of which 9,494 tokens were annotated as 'verbal multi-word expressions'.\\n\\n\u2022 EPIE Dataset (Saxena and Paul, 2020) \u2013 This dataset includes around 25,000 sentences extracted based on a list of 717 idioms. These instances contain both literally sensed as well as idiomatically sensed sentences along with their annotations.\\n\\n\u2022 MAGPIE Corpus (Haagsma et al., 2020) is an open-source corpus containing more than 50,000 instances extracted from BNC (BNC, Consortium et al., 2007) base corpus and annotated through the process of crowdsourcing using a fixed list containing 2007 idiom types in English.\\n\\n\u2022 IMPLI dataset (Stowe, 2022) includes instances containing idioms and other multi-word expressions like metaphors prepared as paired statements with automated 24K silver pairs and 1800 manual pairs.\\n\\n\u2022 'SemEval-2022 Task 2' (Madabushi et al., 2022) \u2013 The idiomatically annotated dataset was provided for the shared task of identification of statements in the Portuguese and English languages as either idiomatic or literal. This corpus provided the previous and the next sentence in the context, along with each sentence containing the idiom.\\n\\n\u2022 IMIL Parallel Dataset (Agrawal et al., 2018) - Idiom dataset in the Hindi language that shares the same Devanagari script with the Konkani language, includes a parallel corpus that collects the idioms in English and translates them into 7 different Indian languages, including the Hindi language.\\n\\n3. Method\\n\\nWe used the following process to build the Konidioms dataset. First, we collected a fixed list of 1597 idiomatic expressions from multiple sources including collection from dictionaries, educational books as well as collection through conducted surveys of native Konkani language speakers (section 3.1). We further crowdsourced the task of creating Konkani language sentences with the collected idiom expressions to the native Konkani speakers (section 3.2.1). The crowdsourced work was analyzed for correctness by language experts (section 3.2.2). A different set of language experts further annotated the cleaned data and added idiomatic and literal sense labels to each of the sentences, along with other metadata details like domain and related keywords (section 3.2.3). The sentences obtained after completion of this process, along with their annotations, were aggregated to convert into a labelled dataset for idiomatically and literally sensed statements containing idiomatic expressions.\\n\\n3.1 Collecting Konkani Language Idioms\\n\\nThe process of formation of Konidioms corpus began with the collection of idioms from multiple sources. We attempted to capture idiomatic expressions of multiple types to incorporate the essence of the idioms from general spoken dialogues in the Konkani language. The Konkani dictionary served as a major source for the collection idioms. Additional idioms from school and college level educational books were added to this list. To ensure complete representation of the spectrum of idiom usage in the Konkani spoken language, we conducted a survey of selected elderly Konkani speaking people who were known to use a rich set of idioms in their spoken Konkani. The idioms collected through this method were added to the originally collected list of idioms to obtain a total of 1597 idioms in Konkani. We fixed this list of idioms for the creation of our dataset.\\n\\nA further type-based division of idioms in the Konkani language is not currently available with respect to lexical, semantic or syntactic categories. Therefore, we decided to create and contribute to a semantic type-based categorization by studying the collected idioms, with the guidance of Konkani language...\"}"}

The major criteria for this division, has been to semantically categorize the available idioms, while maintaining the consistency in type-division theories in English language as well as emphasizing the characteristic uniqueness in Konkani language idioms.\\n\\nThe collected idioms were studied and classified into the four different categories based on their characteristics.\\n\\n3.1.1 Category 1: Sound and Reaction-based idiomatic expressions\\n\\nThe first category of idioms includes those idiomatic expressions whose first word does not have any individual meaning and is mostly made up of some kind of sound description. Usually, the literally sensed counterparts of such idioms are very rare. Consider for example the following idiom:\\n\\n\u0920\u094b \u091c\u093e\u0935\u092a (Sound of gunfire) + (to occur)\\n\\n'\u0920\u094b' is assumed to be the sound of a gunfire/explosion (similar to 'bang' in English). In the idiomatic sense, this expression is used to refer to the event of 'failing at something'. Such expressions can be used for example to denote a student failing in an exam.\\n\\n3.1.2 Category 2: Metaphor-based idiomatic expressions\\n\\nSome of the idiomatic expressions in the collected list have evolved from indirect comparisons to certain living objects or their behaviours. Consider for example the following idiom:\\n\\n\u0915\u093e\u0935\u0933\u094d\u092f\u093e \u0906\u0935\u092f \u0906\u0938\u092a (crow + mother + (to - be / exist))\\n\\nTo be the mother of the crow\\n\\nThis idiom literally means 'to be the mother of the crow'. In the idiomatic sense it refers to a gossipmonger. In the comparative inception, it uses an indirect reference and considers the 'crowing' of the crow to be an unpleasant sound and compares it to gossiping.\\n\\n3.1.3 Category 3: Partially idiomatic expressions\\n\\nThose idiomatic expressions whose literal and idiomatic interpretations overlap to a certain extent are included in this category. Usually, one of the words in these idiomatic expressions, has some semantic relation with the literal meaning of the sentence. Consider the following expression as an example:\\n\\n\u0928\u093e\u093e\u0902\u0935 \u092c\u0941\u0921\u092a (name + drown)\\n\\nTo drown one's name\\n\\nThe idiom word-wise means to 'drown one's name'. It semantically means 'to spoil the name and reputation'. The first word name is already giving a brief idea about the idiomatic sense, but the verb used along with it (to drown) does not semantically relate to the first word.\\n\\n3.1.4 Category 4: Completely idiomatic expressions\\n\\nThese are expressions whose constituent words do not correlate at all to the idiomatic meaning of the sentence. Consider for example:\\n\\n\u0916\u094b\u092c\u0930\u0947 \u091c\u093e\u0935\u092a (crushed dry coconut) + (become / occur)\\n\\nTo become a crushed dry coconut\\n\\nThe idiomatic sense of this expression refers to being ruined or destroyed and has no connection with the constituent words that refer to the dry coconut.\\n\\nThe linguistic model for this classification was inspired from the idiom-type classification in English language by Fernando (Wray, 2000; Liu, 2008; Salih, 2017). This model divides idioms into three categories \u2013 pure idioms, semi-idioms and literal idioms. Based on our study we also felt the need for metaphor-based category based on idiom type classification by Moon (McCarthy, 1998) that classifies the idioms based on their transparencies. But in the case of Konkani, the number of metaphor-based idioms contributed to only 1.5% of the total idioms and hence we did not feel the need to include further transparency classifications as divided by Moon (McCarthy, 1998).\\n\\nStructural classifications of idioms (David, 2008; O'Dell, 2002) like prepositional phrase, binomial and trinomial idioms were not considered for classification in Konkani language as we did not find such structural fixedness in Konkani idioms (for example binomial structure of \\\"something + and + something\\\" is very uncommon in Konkani idioms). We found that the sound and reaction-based idioms occurred very frequent in the Konkani language and we did not find a similar category in the other classifications in linguistics. Based on this observation, we added an additional 'sound and reaction based idiomatic expressions' category to our classification.\\n\\nThe percentage distribution of collected idioms according to the four categories is shown in table 1.\\n\\n| Idiom Category                     | Distribution |\\n|------------------------------------|--------------|\\n| Sound and Reaction-based idiomatic expressions | 2%           |\\n| Metaphor-based idiomatic expressions   | 1.5%         |\\n| Partially idiomatic expressions         | 7%           |\\n| Completely idiomatic expressions         | 89%          |\\n\\nTable 1: Category-wise Distribution of Collected Idioms\\n\\nCompletely idiomatic expressions form a major part of the collected idioms list. The idioms from category 1 and category 2 \u2013 Sound and Reaction-based and Metaphor-based idioms will rarely possess literal counterparts. We can assume less than 96% of the total idiomatic expressions collected are more likely to be ambiguous (potentially idiomatic), meaning they can have either an idiomatic sense or a literal sense in any particular context.\"}"}

This idiom corpus is, to our knowledge, the first to be developed in Konkani language. To create the sentences, we decided to use the crowdsourcing approach. We provided the crowdsourced participants with an interface that mentioned the list of potentially idiomatic expressions along with their meanings. The workers were allowed to create any number of grammatically correct sentences with the freedom to create sentences with either idiomatic meaning or literal meaning as long as any specified idiomatic expression from the list was included in the sentence. The participants were allowed to create the sentences where the component words of the idiomatic expression were not used together, but were scattered throughout the sentences. The participants had to choose the idiom from the list using the interface and type out formulated sentences in the textbox provided on the interface. The participants were instructed to create any valid sentence from their regular spoken language dialogues that they use at home, office or otherwise in daily life.\\n\\n### 3.2.1 Appointing Crowdworkers\\n\\nThe selection of the crowdworkers was initially done through a simple online test as we needed only native Konkani language speakers that confirm to the selected dialect of this language in Devnagari script. Initially 10 participants were selected for this task based on the online test. After review of their initial work, 7 crowdworkers were retained for the creation of the Konidioms dataset, based on the quality check done by the experts (section 3.2.2). The retained workers were asked to work for at least 3 hours/day and create a minimum number of 50 sentences per day. They were paid Rupees 100/hour as wages. The work was assigned with a timeline of 20 days. After expert supervision of the crowdsourced work and management of some of the participants, the system became stable and was able to reliably create a minimum of 350 sentences per day. At the end of this crowdsourcing phase, we collected a total of 7060 sentences.\\n\\n### 3.2.2 Managing the Reliability of Crowdworkers\\n\\nThe validity of the sentences created by the crowdsourced workers was evaluated by three experts for correctness. The experts were highly qualified post-graduates in the Konkani language with a prior working experience of minimum 8 years associated with the language. The experts were paid Rupees 300/hour for the evaluation task. They evaluated the sentences for grammatical correctness, correct inclusion of the idiomatic expressions in the created sentences and for ethical correctness of the sentences. Based on the feedback from the experts, certain crowdworkers who were consistently giving poor quality statements were discontinued from giving inputs in the dataset creation work. Other workers were made to incorporate the changes as advised by the experts, to maintain the correctness of the sentences in the dataset.\\n\\n### 3.2.3 Annotation by Experts\\n\\nThe annotation of the sentences was carried out by two experts. Each expert assigned a label to every listing in the dataset that identified the meaning of the idiomatic expression used in the sentence as idiomatic or literal. The annotators were also asked to add the overall domain that the sentence with the idiomatic expression covered along with the related keywords. The two experts were qualified with a post-graduation degree in Konkani Literature and more than 10 years of teaching experience in the language apart from being native Konkani language speakers. Each of the experts was paid Rupees 300 per hour for this task.\\n\\nAn effective inter-annotator agreement was obtained with Cohen's kappa constant value of 0.92 for the annotation task of labelling sentences as idiomatic or literal. The different keywords and domains specified by the annotators were merged to create the final genre metadata. We also carried out a separate evaluation of the sentences in the dataset, wherever the experts had difficulty annotating them, or where each of the annotators had assigned different labels to the sentences. Through the discussion between the evaluation committee and the annotators, the contentious sentences were divided into the following four categories.\\n\\n- **Ambiguous** \u2013 This category included the sentences whose sense can be inferred as both idiomatic as well as literal. Such statements would need access to the previous and following statements in the context for interpreting the meaning correctly. Such sentences contributed to 9% of the inter-annotator disagreements. As a solution to this category of statements, some of the sentences were retained after making minor modifications to the sentences to reduce their ambiguity. Some of the highly ambiguous instances were discarded.\\n\\n- **Unclear Interpretation** \u2013 Around 6% of the idiomatic expressions in the Konkani language have more than one semantic meaning even when used in only idiomatic sense. The correctness of such sentences depends on what meaning the idiomatic expression is interpreted with. Due to this unclear usage some of the valid sentences with idiomatic sense were deemed as literal. This was solved by discussion with the annotators about the multiple meanings and the varying viewpoints were considered while annotating the sentences. Accordingly based on the context and usage of such expressions, the annotators decided whether to retain the label or update it.\\n\\n- **Discontinuous** \u2013 There were instances in the dataset where idiomatic expressions were not used in contiguous space. The component words of the idiomatic expression were not used together as an expression, but were scattered throughout the sentences. For this\"}"}

This decision was taken based on the fact that although some of the words appeared in between the idiomatic expression in the sentence, it still held on to the correct idiomatic or literal sense of the sentence. This may provide a good ground for testing of 'token level' word-wise tagging of each word in the sentence as idiom or literal. The label 'continuous' in each listing is assigned either a value 'yes' indicating the expression is used as a whole together in the sentence or it is assigned a value 'no' for discontinuous expressions in the sentence.\\n\\n\u2022 Others \u2013 Some sentences were questioned based on the usage as being neither idiomatic, nor literal, but instead belonging completely to other multiword classes. Such sentences were discarded from the current dataset.\\n\\n3.2.4 Crowdsourcing and Annotation Outcome\\n\\nAs a result of the complete creation and annotation process, a total of 6520 sentences were successfully included in the dataset. Out of the originally created 7060 instances by the crowdworkers, 438 sentences were discarded by the experts on account of incorrect grammar or non-inclusion of the correct idioms or due to ethical considerations. Around 102 sentences were discarded by the expert annotators owing to annotation difficulties. 92% of the originally created sentences are now a part of the final Konidioms Corpus after a thorough quality check.\\n\\n4. The Konidioms Corpus\\n\\nThe 6520 datapoint instances finally constituted the Konidioms corpus in the form of training and testing sets. A single datapoint instance in the Konidioms corpus is shown in table 2. Every instance consists of the following \u2013\\n\\n\u2022 A unique identifier 'Id' \u2013 an integer number that identifies each instance in the dataset.\\n\u2022 The field 'Idiom' states the idiomatic expression used in the sentence in Konkani language.\\n\u2022 The field 'Contextual_meaning' provides the context-wise interpreted meaning(s) of the idiomatic expression in English.\\n\u2022 The 'Sentence' field is the sentence created using the specified idiomatic expression.\\n\u2022 'Usage_sense_label' shows the final annotation label given by the annotators for the sentence. It can take only two values: 'literal' or 'idiom'.\\n\u2022 The 'Continuous' field is used to indicate whether the entire idiomatic expression is used together in the sentence or it is split into separate tokens throughout the sentence. 'Continuous' can take two values: 'yes' or 'no'. The value 'yes' indicates that the idiomatic expression is used as a whole expression and value 'no' indicates use of expression in a discontinuous manner.\\n\u2022 'Domain' specifies the overall genre in the English language, of the instances given in the dataset.\\n\u2022 The field 'split' is used to denote the division of the sentences in the form of training and testing splits. A 'split' can take two values: 'train', 'test'. The 'train' value indicates that the instance belongs to the training set. The testing sets are divided into two parts. The 'test' split instances consist of a combination of instances with some idioms included from the training set in a different sentence and some unseen idioms. Each of the two sets include examples from all the four categories of idiomatic expressions.\\n\\nId: 1\\nIdiom: \u091c\u0940\u092c \u0935\u093e\u0931\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0930 \u0918\u093e\u0932\u092a (tongue) + (on-air) + (to-put)\\nto put tongue on air\\nContextual_meaning: speak with no apparent reason/divulge secrets\\nSentence: \u0906\u092e\u091a\u0940 \u0936\u0947\u091c\u093e\u0928\u094d\u0928 \u0906\u092a\u0932\u0940 \u091c\u0940\u092c \u0935\u093e\u0931\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0930 \u0918\u093e\u0932\u0924\u093e our neighbour (Female) puts.

This scenario is comprehensible as in the Konkani language, certain idiomatic expressions, especially from categories 1 and 2 rarely possess literal interpretations. This phenomenon is observed in the nature of the regularly spoken natural language Konkani. In the case of English idioms corpus as well, the dominance of idiomatically sensed sentences has been observed in the existing corpus (Haagsma et al., 2020). The Konidioms dataset covers a wide range of genres through large variations in the sentence domains of the instances.\\n\\n5. Analysis of The Konidioms Corpus\\n\\n5.1 Frequency Distribution\\n\\nThe crowdworkers were given freedom to write any number of sentences for the idiomatic expressions of their choice without any specific instruction or constraint on writing idiomatic interpretations or literal interpretations of the expressions. This method was followed to ensure the natural valid frequency distribution of the idioms, as the native speakers are more likely to remember and create sentences for the idioms that they hear more often in instances, while speaking the language in general. Therefore, the more the frequency of an idiom in the dataset, the more likely it is to be used in the spoken Konkani language. The overall frequency distribution of the idioms in the Konidioms dataset is shown in table 4.\\n\\n| Frequency Range | Number of Idioms |\\n|-----------------|-----------------|\\n| 1 - 5           | 1262            |\\n| 6 - 10          | 204             |\\n| 11 - 15         | 85              |\\n| 16 - 20         | 24              |\\n| 21 - 25         | 18              |\\n| 26 - 30         | 2               |\\n| >30             | 2               |\\n\\nTable 4: Dimensions of the Konidioms Dataset\\n\\nThe distribution depicts that 80% of the idioms are used less frequently in the spoken dialogue-based Konkani language statements. Only 1% of the idioms have high occurrence in the language and these idiomatic expressions have contributed to the maximum number of sentences in the Konidioms dataset. This distribution confirms the general belief that although idioms are believed to be a rare occurrence, some small groups of idioms occur very frequently and can be usually found in most of the spoken language conversation dialogue.\\n\\nThe frequency distribution of the idioms category wise is shown in table 5. The maximum number of collected idioms belong to the Category 4\u2014completely idiomatic expressions. Idioms from this category have occurred most frequently and a total of 5801 instances of the Konidioms corpus belong to this category. Sound-based and Metaphor-based idiomatic expressions form only 2.5% of the Konidioms dataset. The frequency of occurrence for a single idiom in the Konidioms dataset is higher in partially idiomatic expressions. The overall instances in the Konidioms dataset that contain partially idiomatic expressions are comparatively less. This implies that although small number of partially idiomatic expressions exist, their corresponding usage in the Konkani language is very high.\\n\\n| Category                              | No of Idioms | Frequency Range |\\n|---------------------------------------|--------------|-----------------|\\n| Sound and Reaction-based idiomatic expressions | 31           | 1\u201313            |\\n| Metaphor-based idiomatic expressions   | 24           | 1\u20137             |\\n| Partially idiomatic expressions       | 112          | 1\u201321            |\\n| Completely idiomatic expressions      | 1430         | 1\u201336            |\\n\\nTable 5: Category-wise Frequency Distribution\\n\\n5.2 Domain Distribution\\n\\nDomain categorization of the Konidioms dataset is carried out in two parts. The first part calculates the percentage distribution of the collected idioms over the specified list of domains. The second part measures the distribution of the domains across the sentence instances in the Konidioms dataset. We considered the list of 18 different domains based on our understanding of division in the corpus. This list of domains was provided to the experts. The experts were requested to assign a fitting domain from the list to each of the instances. Experts were allowed to assign more than one domain as per the variations in the sentence instance. Table 6 shows the distribution of domains across the idiomatic expressions into the selected 18 domain categories.\\n\\nIt can be inferred based on the distribution that the maximum number of idiomatic expressions in the Konkani language use the human body elements to denote some other concept in the idiomatic sense. The concrete concept of the existing human body is the most referred domain. The next highest reference for the idioms belongs to the abstract category tilted 'Abstract Life/Soul Concept'. This domain incorporates all the abstract notions of human life\u2014identity, name, soul, humanity, life and death, abstract emotions. The next major set of idioms referred to the five elements of nature in multiple forms. The five elements of nature are traditionally defined as combination of air, water, fire, earth and sky elements. Use of these concrete reference elements usually corresponded to some form of human behavior in the idiomatic senses. 8% of idiomatic expressions refer to the local traditions and beliefs that are practiced by the Konkani language speaking people and provide a cultural aspect to the usage of idioms in the sentence. It was also observed that most of the trees and animals referred to in the Konkani language idiomatic\"}"}

For example, idioms referred to various parts of the coconut tree which grows in abundance across the west coast of India in these Konkani speaking regions.\\n\\nAnother major domain with regards to idiomatic expressions that contributed to 8% of the total expressions was human behaviour that denoted typical human characteristics during any interaction.\\n\\n### Table 6: Distribution of Domains Across the Collected Idioms\\n\\n| Domain                           | Collection | Konidioms |\\n|----------------------------------|------------|-----------|\\n| Human Body                       | 32%        | 34%       |\\n| Abstract Life/Soul Concepts      | 14%        | 6%        |\\n| Five Elements of Nature          | 9%         | 9%        |\\n| Local Traditions and Beliefs     | 8%         | 7%        |\\n| Human Behaviour                  | 8%         | 5%        |\\n| Food and Cooking                 | 5%         | 5%        |\\n| Sound and Reaction               | 5%         | 3%        |\\n| Animals and Insects              | 4%         | 3%        |\\n| Trees and Greenery               | 4%         | 4%        |\\n| Place and Position               | 4%         | 4%        |\\n| Time and Numbers                 | 3%         | 2%        |\\n| Habitation                       | 3%         | 3%        |\\n| Money                            | 3%         | 2%        |\\n| Clothing and Accessories         | 2%         | 2%        |\\n| Metal Objects                    | 2%         | 1%        |\\n| Games and Hobbies                | 1%         | 1%        |\\n| Colour                           | 0.65%      | 1%        |\\n| Temperature                      | 0.5%       | 1%        |\\n\\nThe domain distribution pattern of idioms signifies the category division of 1597 collected idioms which have been formed over years over different cultural aspects. Whereas, the domain distribution of Konidioms corpus instances is the categorization of the sentences created in the corpus not including the idiom domain. The distribution difference tests the hypothesis that most of the sentences with idiomatic expressions belong to the domain that is different from the idioms in the sentence itself. The expected major variation in the domain distribution percentages did not occur.\\n\\nThe domain categorization of Konidioms corpus instances took a very similar distribution as compared to the idiomatic expression distribution. The notable difference lied only in the remarkable reduction of more than 50% in the domain of 'Abstract Life/Soul Concepts'.\\n\\n### 6. Conclusion\\n\\nWe created the first idioms corpus in the low-resource Konkani language to enhance the research progress in idioms processing concepts in Konkani language. This paper describes the detailed process of creation of idioms corpus through a combined approach that used crowdsourcing in combination with expert supervision and annotation. We collected a rich set of 1597 idioms and studied and divided them into categories. We carried out further analysis of the idiomatic expressions in Konkani language with respect to these categories. Through the method of crowdsourcing, we were able to create a good quality corpus of 6520 instances thus establishing crowdsourcing as a viable method for Konkani language corpus creation. We also presented the analysis of the created corpus in terms of frequency and domain distribution. Through analysis we inferred the strong inclusions of domains like human body throughout the use of idiomatic expressions as well as sentence creations in the Konidioms corpus. We also observed that the relevance of certain percentage of idioms was limited to local traditions and beliefs of the Konkani speaking regions. We hope to pave a way to improvements in the machine translation applications and other natural language processing tasks through this dataset contribution to facilitate further research in low-resource languages like Konkani.\\n\\n### 7.
