Recent work has shown that large language models (LLMs) that have access to state information can generate higher quality game turns than LLMs that use dialog history alone. However, previous work used game state information that was heuristically created and was not a true gold standard game state. We present FIREBALL, a large dataset containing nearly 25,000 unique sessions from real D&D gameplay on Discord with true game state info. We recorded game play sessions of players who used the Avrae bot, which was developed to aid people in playing D&D online, capturing language, game commands and underlying game state information. We demonstrate that FIREBALL can improve natural language generation (NLG) by using Avrae state information, improving both automated metrics and human judgments of quality. Additionally, we show that LLMs can generate executable Avrae commands, particularly after finetuning.\\n\\n1 Introduction\\nDungeons & Dragons (D&D) (Gygax and Arneson, 1974) is a tabletop roleplaying game in which players assume the roles of characters in a fantasy adventure. Play is conducted primarily through natural language, with players roleplaying as their characters and describing their actions. Meanwhile another player, the Dungeon Master (DM), controls the fictional story world: setting obstacles, goals, and adventures, controlling monsters, and interpreting players\u2019 actions in the context of the rules of the game. Although the DM makes a lot of the final decisions, the game is ultimately a collaborative storytelling experience.\\n\\nDue to its use of natural language as actions, each individual player must maintain a personal understanding of the game world which they build from conversational history and using Theory of Mind (Martin et al., 2018; Zhou et al., 2022). The natural language action space also means that the AI needs the ability to adequately perform tasks such as language generation, language understanding, and planning (Callison-Burch et al., 2022). Although AI\u2019s capabilities in this space are still nascent, Callison-Burch et al. (2022) have shown that D&D dialog can be improved by adding state information into the input of a large language model (LLM). However, the state information presented in that work was heuristically created using regular expressions and machine learning classifiers. Thus it cannot be considered true ground truth state information. Our work is unique because it provides true ground truth state information.\\n\\nWe use this data for two tasks: Utterance to Command and State to Narration. In the first task, a model is given a game state and turn of the game (roleplay in natural language), and must predict the corresponding command that matches the intent of the roleplay. The second task is a constrained creative natural language generation task: given a state change resulting from a command execution...\"}"}

These game state elements are stored on a character sheet (Figure 2). One player takes on the role of the Dungeon Master (DM). This special player creates the world in which the story is told, role plays all of the characters the other players interact with, and acts as arbiter of the rules of the game.\\n\\nThere are two main modes of gameplay\u2014 in-combat and out-of-combat\u2014 which have different styles of play. In-combat play simulates battles between characters and monsters, and involves turn taking and tracking stats. Out-of-combat play is characterized by freeform collaborative storytelling. Both elements of the game involves rolling dice to determine the success of players' actions (like attempting to attack a monster). The die's outcome is then modified with a stat that represents the character's skill in performing that particular action (e.g., +3 for acrobatics). If the dice roll plus the modifier was above a threshold that the rules or the DM determines (called a difficulty class, or DC), then the action succeeds. Otherwise it fails. The DM then narrates the results.\\n\\nFor example, if an attack hits a monster, the DM might narrate the player's blow and how the monster reacts, taking into account information like the attack's damage type and how many hits the monster has taken previously.\\n\\nTraditionally, D&D is played in person with characters' stats written out on physical character sheets and monster stats referenced from books containing hundreds of prewritten \u201cstat blocks\u201d. To track a stat that changes frequently like hit points, players and DMs use paper and pencil or whiteboards, performing math in their head and writing over the previous value when it changes. Some players also use maps and miniatures to track where characters and monsters are located relative to one another and to aid immersion in the game world. Since the beginning of the pandemic, a large number of groups have moved online using tools like Discord (a messaging program), virtual tabletops that simulate maps, and game state trackers like Avrae rather than physical mediums.\\n\\nAvrae is a Discord bot that was designed to help people play D&D online. It allows players to import their character sheets, allows DMs to access a database of monsters, and simulates dice rolls. During combat, Avrae tracks the game state. This state contains detailed information including the list of participants in the battle, their stat blocks, their current HIT points, and their available actions. Avrae allows players to execute commands representing their characters' actions. It performs a simulated dice roll, adds the player's modifiers, and determines the success or failure of the roll. Avrae then updates the game state, adjusting things like hit points, and turn tracking.\\n\\nA simplified example of interacting with Avrae might look like the following example:\\n\\nPlayer: Filgo crouches down in the bush, loosing an arrow at the dire wolf charging towards him.\\n\\nPlayer: !attack longbow -t DW1\\n\\nAvrae: (Rolls dice and displays the results of the attack and damage dealt, including the new health of the dire wolf.)\\n\\nDungeon Master: Your arrow flies true and the beast lets out a shrill howl as it pierces its matted fur. It's low on health now, so on its turn it'll retreat.\\n\\nIn actual play, an average of 3-8 players (including the DM) take turns interacting with Avrae. By instrumenting Avrae to record these commands and messages before and after a user's inputted command, we collect a rich set of structured gameplay. Appendix B contains a full list of recorded events and their descriptions.\\n\\n4 Dataset\\n\\nWe worked with the developer of Avrae to instrument it to collect game transcripts and log game state information. The data collection was approved by Wizards of the Coast, the game company that owns D&D and Avrae, as well as by our institution's IRB and the Bot Safety team at Discord. Any players who participated in our study provided their informed consent.\\n\\n4.1 Data Collection\\n\\nParticipants were recruited from English-speaking \u201cplay-by-post\u201d D&D Discord servers, where players and Dungeon Masters play by taking turns posting in a Discord text channel to describe their moves. To accomplish this, we made a website explaining the study, and recruited server admins to review the study and opt-in to participate by announcing our research study on the Avrae Discord server. When players began combat in an opted-in server, they were presented with a message informing them of the recording. Players could opt-out.\"}"}

Similarly, recorded actions include the detailed results of each dice roll, such as whether a given attack hit its target or a spell succeeded (a list of all action attributes is available in Appendix C).\\n\\nIn the following sections, we refer to our data as triples consisting of a command and its corresponding state change, any relevant utterances before the command (\u201cpreceding\u201d utterances), and any relevant utterances after the command (\u201cfollowing\u201d utterances). Each of these commands corresponds to an action that an actor in combat can take, such as attacking with a weapon, casting a spell, or using a special ability.\\n\\n4.2 Utterance-Action Alignment\\nTo align utterances with their corresponding state changes, we match each utterance with its chronologically nearest state change, and tag all utterances that occur chronologically before their corresponding state change as an utterance motivating the command (the \u201cpreceding\u201d utterances), and all utterances that occur chronologically after their corresponding state change as narration of the state change (the \u201cfollowing\u201d utterances). These alignments create a prototypical triple as described above. Within each triple, we discard any utterance containing less than five words.\\n\\n4.3 Authorship Filtering\\nWithin each triple, we identify the user who issued the commands, and the Dungeon Master hosting the combat. We discard any utterances within each triple which are not authored by one of these users. Additionally, we discard any triple where the commands originate from multiple different actors, which may occur if a single user is controlling multiple different creatures in a group. Finally, we discard any triple which has neither any \u201cpreceding\u201d utterances nor \u201cfollowing\u201d utterances.\\n\\n4.4 IC/OOC Classification\\nWe further distill the set of \u201cfollowing\u201d utterances by training GPT-3 Ada (Brown et al., 2020) to distinguish between \u201cin-character\u201d (IC) utterances from \u201cout-of-character\u201d (OOC) utterances. In-character utterances are what the player says speaking as their character or to describe their character\u2019s actions. They might look like this:\\n\\n\u201cFilgo puts a hand on his axe, uneasy after the shaking he\u2019d felt from the ground. \u201cIs someone there?\u201d\\n\\nMeanwhile, out-of-character utterances occur across players/the DM when not speaking as any particular character. This dialog might be to discuss rules or strategy, or might be unrelated to gameplay entirely. Out-of-character utterances might look like this:\\n\\n\u201cHow much health do you have left? I\u2019ll move back 30 feet after. BRB, going to the bathroom.\u201d\\n\\nTo distinguish between these categories, we fine-tuned a classifier that was pretrained on Giant in the Playground data (Callison-Burch et al., 2022), forum roleplay data which includes labels for in-character and out-of-character posts, on a hand-labelled set of 750 utterances randomly sampled from our dataset. The classifier achieved an accuracy of 94% on a validation set of 125 utterances. We then applied the classifier to each utterance in our dataset and discarded any out-of-character utterances from the \u201cfollowing\u201d set since in-character text is usually more interesting and evocative. Finally, we also removed sections of utterances contained in parentheses, which usually indicate OOC speech, from the \u201cfollowing\u201d set.\\n\\n4.5 Dataset Size\\nOur dataset contains 25k unique combat scenarios, including 8M utterances from 3.6k unique authors covering 1.3M unique combat states.

For example, in the scenario illustrated in Figure 1, a dwarf named Filgo is fighting a Dire Wolf. On his turn, his player narrates that Filgo attacks with his axe, then runs the command to target the monster with his attack. Notice how, in this example, the player references the target dire wolf by its creature type (\\\"the wolf\\\"), rather than its name in the game state (\\\"DW1\\\").\\n\\nTo accomplish this task, we provide the state information included in our dataset\u2014namely the list of actors participating in combat and any information about those actors, such as their monster type and current hit points\u2014to the models. The full prompt for the example mentioned above is available in Appendix F.\\n\\nAfter our distillation passes, our dataset contains 120,000 aligned utterance-command pairs. We examine the accuracy of predicted commands on both a token level and by injecting predicted commands into the Avrae system. Finally, we also examine the performance of models without game state information included to demonstrate the importance of the game state.\\n\\n5.1 Models\\nWe use GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) Davinci models (as of Dec. 2022) as a base. Finetuned models are using standard Davinci, while few-shot models use Davinci-002. For the Utterance to Command generation task, we evaluate four main treatments:\\n\\n- **FT + S**: The base model is finetuned on a sample of 30K examples from FIREBALL with state information presented in the prompt.\\n- **FT**: The base model is finetuned on a sample of 30K examples from FIREBALL without any state information presented in the prompt.\\n- **FS + S**: The base model is presented 3 exemplars (few-shot) sampled from FIREBALL with relevant state information.\\n- **FS**: The base model is presented 3 exemplars sampled from FIREBALL without any state information.\\n\\n5.2 Evaluation\\nEach of the generation tasks is evaluated independently. Since the command generation task is more akin to a structured generation task, we evaluate only on objective correctness rather than subjective quality of generated text. We evaluate the generated commands over four quantitative metrics: pass rate, unit tests, RougeL (Lin, 2004) and Average Sentence Gleu (SGleu) (Mutton et al., 2007).\\n\\nWe first seek to evaluate whether the generated command is a valid Avrae command by simply passing the command to Avrae and checking for successful execution. Similar to Chen et al. (2021) we calculate a pass rate metric that determines the proportion of generations that constitute valid Avrae commands. To calculate this metric, we have each model generate commands for 1000 utterances randomly sampled from a held out test set, and simply count the proportion of generations that Avrae is able to successfully execute.\\n\\nSecond, we evaluate what proportion of generated commands would result in the desired state update through a number of hand-written unit tests. Each test accepts a predefined combat state, an utterance, and the corresponding model-generated command and validates assertions on the combat state update. We took 10 common scenarios seen in D&D for these unit tests, generating 10 commands for each scenario-model pair. Since these generated commands sometimes have repeats, we take the unique commands from the set of generations and validate which proportion of the generated samples pass the handwritten unit tests by running assertions on the updated combat state after running the command through Avrae.\\n\\nLastly, we perform a qualitative analysis to better understand the nature of the grounding. We took two popular spells (Bardic Inspiration and Fireball) and hand constructed a scenario for each. We then perturb the prompts that we present to the model to study the model's sensitivity to inputs.\\n\\n5.3 Results & Discussion\\nTable 2 displays the objective evaluations of the four treatments in the Utterance to Command generation task. We see that the model which was finetuned on FIREBALL with the state information\"}"}

SGleu refers to the average Sentence Gleu.\\n\\n(FT+S) significantly outperforms all other models (i.e., both models without the state information and the few-shot models). Within the perturbation results (detailed in Appendix D), we notice that the FT+S model can accurately gauge the state of the actors in combat. For example, when asked to cast a Fireball at injured enemies, it successfully parses the prompt to find the subset of enemies that were injured and only targets them in the resulting command. Further, the model can accurately determine which of the prepared spells correspond to an utterance. For example, an utterance that would have generated the Fireball spell generates the spell Burning Hands instead if Fireball is removed from the prepared spell list.\\n\\n6. State to Narration Task\\n\\nIn this task, we want to generate a narrative utterance describing the effects of a player's actions, given all of the state changes since the start of the player's turn in combat.\\n\\nFor example, in the scenario illustrated in Figure 1, a party is fighting a Sea Hag. On the cleric's turn, she attacks the hag with her mace, but misses. After seeing the result of her action, she narrates the miss, referencing the result as the hag dodging the attack.

All metrics aside from perplexity are calculated using the human narration as a reference. The results of our automated evaluation are available in Table 3.\\n\\nWe note that automated metrics are not particularly suited for evaluation of creative natural language generation. Perplexity is a measure of how \\\"unexpected\\\" a sequence is to a language model, which does not directly correlate with the quality of creative generation. Furthermore, BertScore and ROUGE evaluate similarity to a reference, which is an imperfect fit for our task where two narrations can differ substantially yet both be of high quality. These limitations are evident in the disparity in results between automated and human evaluation, which is expected given previous work that reached...\"}"}

In total, we recruited 45 evaluators from the Avrae user base based on their experience with Avrae and D&D. All evaluators had played D&D using Avrae before: 37 had used Avrae for over a year and 37 had been the Dungeon Master of a game using Avrae. Evaluators were rewarded with a set of codes for digital goods on D&D Beyond with a market value of $36 for completing the rating task.\\n\\nWe provided each evaluator a version of the context that was provided to the models: the last fifteen messages sent in a channel, the casting actor and their description, a list of actors in combat, and the current state of those actors. Along with each context, we provided one generated utterance from each model along with the true utterance sent by a human. The evaluators were asked to rate each output along three dimensions, following the evaluation procedure used for the Meena LM (Kulshreshtha et al., 2020) and D&D Dialogue dataset (Callison-Burch et al., 2022):\\n\\n\u2022 Does the response make sense? (yes/no)\\n\u2022 Is the response specific? (yes/no)\\n\u2022 How interesting is the response? (10 point scale)\\n\\nEach evaluator rated 3 to 7 scenarios randomly drawn from a set of 75, with at least 3-way redundancy for each scenario. The full annotator instructions and a mockup of the annotation interface are given in Appendix G.\\n\\n6.4 Results & Discussion\\n\\nThe results of our human evaluation are tabulated in Table 4. Both FIREBALL models outperform the baseline models in sensibility and specificity by an average of 15 percentage points (significant to \\\\( p < 0.01 \\\\)), and on average perform similarly to a human (\\\\( p > 0.5 \\\\)). A detailed analysis of significance can be found in Appendix H. Generally, models that were aware of the game context (including COMMAND) were more interesting than the model tasked with simply continuing the chat history, and comparable to human performance.\\n\\nIt may seem unusual for the human performance to be so low, only making sense to an experienced D&D player about 50% of the time. One explanation could be that human-written responses were more likely to refer to background knowledge not provided in the model\u2019s context, and therefore may have caused raters to mark the response as nonsensical. We compiled qualitative feedback from our evaluators to provide some insight into why this may be, as well as identify some common failure cases of our models. We summarize some of the reoccurring themes here.\\n\\nRemoving Player Agency.\\n\\nThe most common theme among evaluators\u2019 feedback was that they did not want the model to take control of their character away from the player. One evaluator noted that \u201cseveral [narrations] had player characters acting or speaking in response to the action. That\u2019s something I would never want a human DM doing unprompted and it might be frustrating to have the bot look like it\u2019s trying to control what my character does or says.\u201d This problem extended to the Dungeon Master\u2019s role, as well; one evaluator mentioned that some AI responses would specify creatures\u2019 movement and \u201cdrag [their] encounters down the hallway.\u201d\\n\\nHit Point Reasoning.\\n\\nAnother common failure case was models\u2019 tendency to describe any damage to a target, regardless of the target\u2019s true remaining health, as a kill. According to one evaluator, \u201cI ran into a scenario where the text was absolutely great, but incredibly wrong. A player scored a critical hit on a Mind Flayer with a bow, and left the mind flayer bloodied. The long text stated the scenario beautifully, even got the weapon right... but said it...\u201d\"}"}

In this scenario, a Dragonborn Bard named Umbrage has just cast the Cause Fear spell against a pack of Death Dogs. As a result of the command being run, three of the dogs fail to save and are afraid; four resist the effect.\\n\\n\\\"We noticed this failure case was more prevalent among the DIALOG and COMMAND models, demonstrating that our state-aware models were able to appropriately ground the generated narratives. Nevertheless, even the state-aware models often made this mistake. We have seen in our dataset that humans tend to only narrate critical portions of a fight, like when an enemy is killed. This reporting bias creates a disproportionately large number of narrations in our training set that reference a creature being killed. Therefore, the models trained on this data skew towards narrating that monsters are killed.\\n\\nTable 5 shows a scenario that exemplifies many of these aspects. Without the guidance of previous dialog turns, the COMMAND model hallucinates names for the caster and the targeted creatures. The DIALOG, FIREBALL-SHORT, and FIREBALL-FULL models produce plausible next utterances based on the details provided in the player's utterance but exhibit some of the discussed failure cases: it acts as the Dungeon Master to narrate that the dogs have fled and it references the first dog dying, which it did not (in the game state, the dog still has a full 39/39 hit points). For reference, the true next utterance as written by the player does not mention any effect of the spell, instead focusing on the character's movement. The full game state and chat history associated with this example is included in Appendix I.\\n\\n7 Conclusions\\nWe have demonstrated how the FIREBALL dataset can be used to predict game commands that correctly match a player's intent and generate cohesive and grounded narration from the results of a game action. Our Utterance to Command model is capable of translating roleplay into game-specific actions and can aid novice users, reducing the amount of time players spend looking up documentation and allowing them to play the game more. Our State to Narration model can help inspire the Dungeon Master and take some of the cognitive load off of repetitive writing tasks, allowing them to focus on creating an enjoyable experience for the players. FIREBALL opens the door to multiple exciting avenues of research, and we're excited to see how future work utilizes our unique dataset of state-augmented gameplay.\\n\\n8 Limitations\\nDungeons & Dragons is a very complex game to capture completely, and there are certain aspects that FIREBALL does not take into account. For example, FIREBALL's scenarios are recorded independently of the overarching narrative context they take place in, do not record players' inventory, and do not account for any movement or placement on a map. Our models are not able to play D&D autonomously \u2014 but doing so is not the goal. Instead, D&D models can be used to assist and inspire the humans playing.\\n\\nOur models do not take into account the generation of...\"}"}

The table gives an example for the character Filgo Bitterfoot, a level 5 Dwarf Fighter. We also explain the function of each attribute within the rules of D&D, as well as a possible use case for generative applications.\\n\\n### Attribute\\n\\n| Example | Description | Use Case |\\n|---------|-------------|----------|\\n| **Name** | Filgo Bitterfoot | Character's name. | Both commands and narration usually reference actors by their name. |\\n| **Class Level** | Fighter 5 | Classes inform what types of actions the character is good at, while level is the amount of \\\"experience\\\" the character has. | An actor's classes offer a general overview of their abilities. |\\n| **Stats** | STR: 15; DEX: 10; CON: 17; INT: 10; WIS: 14; CHA: 10; Proficiency: +3 | Strength, dexterity, constitution, intelligence, wisdom, & charisma. Being proficient in a stat or skill means that a bonus is added to their die outcome. | Can be used to condition text generation; for example, a strong character's actions would likely be described differently from a dexterous character. |\\n| **Skills** | Acrobatics +0; Animal Handling +5 (proficient);... | | |\\n| **Saves** | STR +5; DEX +0; CON +6; INT +0; WIS +2; CHA +0 | Saves are bonuses for when a character is defending against an attack. | |\\n| **Resistances** | Resistant to fire, poison | Cuts the amount of damage done or removes it entirely if they are immune. | Useful for game reasoning: don't use fire abilities against an immune target. |\\n| **Attacks** | Frost Brand Scimitar (+5 to hit, 2d6+2 damage); Unarmed Strike (+5 to hit, 1d4+2 damage); ... | Weapons, bonuses for the ability to hit the target, and the amount of damage the target takes when hit. 2d6 indicates 2 6-sided dice. | These attributes provide a more detailed list of the actor's capabilities. For command prediction, the actor may only use an ability they actually have. For text generation, an ability list can help describe the actor's style (e.g. \\\"an ice mage\\\"). |\\n| **Spellbook** | +5 Spell Bonus; DC 13; Spells: Fireball, Prestidigitation, ... | Bonus to see if a spell hits the target, the amount the target needs to beat when being hit by the spell in order to dodge it, a list of spells that the character can cast (each with different outcomes) | |\\n| **Actions**\u2020 | Rally; Second Wind; Interception; Action Surge; Disarming Attack; ... | Class-specific abilities. | |\\n| **Custom Counters\u2020** | Superiority Dice: 4/4; Second Wind: 1/1; Action Surge: 1/1 | Limitation on the number of times the character can use an action before resting. | Certain abilities can only be used a certain number of times. |\\n| **Armor Class** | 18 | How difficult the character is to hit. | Provides information about how dire a situation might be for more interesting text generation. Actors are also commonly referred to by a combination of these (e.g. \\\"the prone dwarf\\\"). |\\n| **Hit Points** | 54 / 54 (0 temp) | How \\\"healthy\\\" a character is. | Filgo has 54 points out of 54. |\\n| **Effects*** | Prone, Stunned | Combat-specific states that affect how attacks resolve. | |\\n| **Creature Type** | Humanoid | Category of creature. Other examples are undead and dragon. | |\\n| **Race\u2020** | Mountain Dwarf | Fantasy race that might provide extra bonuses or actions. | |\\n| **Description\u2020** | \\\"Filgo is a level 5 Mountain Dwarf Fighter. He is 100 years old, 4' tall...\\\" | Natural-language description of the character, how they look & what they're like. | Provides qualitative information about the actor useful for text conditioning, e.g. Louis and Sutton (2018). |\\n\\nTable 6: A list of common attributes associated with actors in FIREBALL.\\n\\n\u2020 Only available for player characters.\\n\\n* Only available for actors in combat.\\n\\nCharacter sheet for this example actor available at https://github.com/zhudotexe/FIREBALL/blob/main/Filgo_Bitterfoot.pdf.\"}"}

The model seems to be able to reliably differentiate between healthy and injured enemies - asking the model to cast Fireball at the injured enemies generates the appropriate command.\\n\\nIt also seems to be able to target based on character classes and races. However, it does not always target the correct number of enemies - asking the model to target \\\"2 injured orcs\\\" leads to targeting all the injured orcs. Similarly, asking the model to target based on party roles fails; asking the model to target \\\"the casters\\\" does not correctly target the spellcasters in the party.
