They provide instructions on how to interpret the discourse, and their study is paramount to understand the mechanism underlying discourse organization. This paper presents a new language resource, an ISO-based annotated multilingual parallel corpus for discourse markers. The corpus comprises nine languages, Bulgarian, Lithuanian, German, European Portuguese, Hebrew, Romanian, Polish, and Macedonian, with English as a pivot language. In order to represent the meaning of the discourse markers, we propose an annotation scheme of discourse relations from ISO 24617-8 with a plug-in to ISO 24617-2 for communicative functions. We describe an experiment in which we applied the annotation scheme to assess its validity. The results reveal that, although some extensions are required to cover all the multilingual data, it provides a proper representation of discourse markers value. Additionally, we report some relevant contrastive phenomena concerning discourse markers interpretation and role in discourse. This first step will allow us to develop deep learning methods to identify and extract discourse relations and communicative functions, and to represent that information as Linguistic Linked Open Data (LLOD).\\n\\nKeywords: multilingual corpus, discourse markers, ISO-based annotation scheme, discourse relations, communicative functions\\n\\n1. Introduction\\n\\nThe notion of discourse marker (Zwicky, 1985; Schiffrin, 1987; Lenk, 1998) is an elusive and fuzzy concept. The term is often used interchangeably with, inter alia, discourse particle (Schourup, 1985; Kroon, 1995), pragmatic marker (Fraser, 1996; Aijmer et al., 2006), pragmatic particle (\u00d6stman, 1981) or discourse connective (Blakemore, 2006). In earlier studies, discourse markers were studied from a structural, discourse organization perspective, while more recent investigations also focus on their role as establishing local dependencies (Prasad et al., 2008), and on the epistemetic stance they may encode, thus following an attitudinal or affective perspective (Sanders et al., 1992; B\u0105czkowska, 2016). Regardless of the adopted definition or theoretical approach, discourse markers provide instructions on how to interpret the discourse (Crible and Zufferey, 2015), and its study is paramount to understand the mechanism underlying discourse organization.\"}"}

ISO 24617-8 puts forward an interoperable core-annotation scheme for discourse relations, which with a plug-in to ISO 24617-2 can adequately represent the meaning of discourse markers, and be used cross-linguistically. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first cross-lingual application of parts 8 and 2 of standard 24617 to the annotation of discourse markers.\\n\\nIn this paper, first we revise some of the related work (section 2), then the annotation scheme is presented (section 3) and finally we discuss data preparation (section 4), annotation challenges (section 5) and overall results (section 6).\\n\\n2. Related work\\n\\nDiscourse markers are single-word or multiword expressions (MWE) from syntactic classes of conjunctions, adverbials, and prepositional phrases (Fraser, 2009a), but also according to some authors, expressions such as you know, you see, and I mean (Schiffrin, 2001; Maschler and Schiffrin, 2015). In addition to signaling moves in conversation and dialogue (Heeman and Allen, 1999), discourse markers signal coherence relations established between clauses and sentences (Das, 2014; Taboada, 2006). For that reason, some authors have proposed a somewhat polemic, but useful, distinction (Crible, 2016) between relational and non-relational discourse markers, depending on their semantic or interactional use. Although the line that divides these two groups can be blurry, taxonomies for both types have been proposed either separately (Mann and Thompson, 1988; Sanders et al., 1992; Prasad et al., 2008), or in conjunction (Gonz\u00e1lez, 2005; Crible, 2014).\\n\\nSince discourse markers are amply considered significant discourse relations' triggers, they have been researched for discourse relation detection and analysis (e.g. Sanders et al. (1992); Knott and Dale (1993); Marcu (2000); Silvano (2010); Das (2014); Bunt and Prasad (2016); Das and Taboada (2019)). As a result, a significant number of annotated corpora with discourse relations signaled by discourse markers has been developed: for example, RST-DT English corpus (Carlson et al., 2003); Penn Discourse Tree Bank (PDTB) (Prasad et al., 2008); SDRT Annodis French corpus (Afantenos et al., 2012). Presently, the large bulk of these corpora is manually annotated, mostly by trained linguists, less by non-experts (cf. Scholman et al. (2016) for the efficacy of annotation by non-experts), and only a reduced number undergoes automatic/semiautomatic annotation (with human supervision). One of the complex Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks capturing discourse structure has been addressed by Zufferey (2004). He describes a three-step process: detecting the occurrence of discourse markers, attaching the inferential semantic functions to discourse markers, and determining the scope of the characteristic functions. The typical functions of discourse markers embrace: connecting discourse, signaling hesitation, turn-taking and theme, marking turn boundaries, hedging, disclosing attitude, and regulating relationship with the interlocutor, as well as seeking approval (Jucker and Ziv, 1998).\\n\\nThe research about discourse markers allows the identification of lexical items that can be incorporated into the lexicons and the definition of new characteristic features. Recently, shared tasks such as DISRPT 2019 and 2021 editions (Zeldes et al. (2019); Zeldes et al. (2021)) have also greatly improved automatic methods for discourse markers detection, as well as Discourse Relation Classification across RST, SDRT, and PDTB (see, for example, DisCoDisCo (Gessler et al., 2021) with a Transformer-based neural classifier).\\n\\nIn terms of language coverage, discourse markers annotated corpora vary greatly. Since language coverage is not uniform, cross-lingual methods have been explored to include less resourced languages (TED-MDB, but also already Gylling-J\u00f8rgensen and Korzen (2011)). NLP research embraces cross-lingual language models by applying the approach to multiple languages searching for the effectiveness of cross-lingual pretraining (Ding et al., 2020). The cross-lingual studies of discourse markers and linking discourse marker inventories by applying LLOD techniques allow creating interlinked, multilingual discourse marker lexicons to be used for further analysis of cross-lingual discourse structure (Chiarcos and Ionov, 2021). However, cross-lingual techniques necessarily extend to languages for which resources already exist, so it would be desirable to compare the resources that already exist for these languages, and/or to use these external data to complement the notoriously scarce training data for discourse annotations.\\n\\nFocusing on the languages from our corpus, if, on the one hand, there are languages like English and German that are very well covered, on the other hand, languages such as Hebrew, Macedonian, Portuguese, Lithuanian, Romanian, Bulgarian, Polish, and Romanian are low-resourced languages.\\n\\nAlthough with fewer language resources compared to English, German is relatively well covered. With the Potsdam Commentary Corpus (Bourgonje and Stede, 2020, PCC), the CoNaNo corpus (Stede and Heintze, 2004) and the DimLex discourse marker inventory (Scheffler and Stede, 2016), a number of resources for discourse analysis have been available for years. German is also covered in the TED-MDB corpus (Zeyrek et al., 2020). Aside from these small-scale resources,\"}"}

There are no native SemAF discourse annotations available for German, but several of these resources adopt schemes which have mappings to SemAF so that these resources can be used for external evaluation of both manual annotation as well as future projection experiments into German. Moreover, they can be used to evaluate the mapping of external schemes to SemAF. While Bunt and Prasad (2016) provides mappings of PDTB, RST, and SDRT to SemAF, these do seem not to have been evaluated on a quantitative basis, so far.\\n\\nBy contrast, the other languages from our corpus, in spite of a wide variety of studies about discourse markers, lack language resources with discourse markers annotation. In Lithuanian consistently annotated discourse related data is covered by TED-MDB, which is a comparatively small corpus (Oleskeviciene et al., 2018). There have been attempts to research spoken Lithuanian discourse markers by either focusing on certain expressions (\u0160ink\u016bnien\u0117, 2020) or carrying out a synchronic and diachronic corpus-based analysis of discourse markers (\u0160ink\u016bnien\u0117 et al., 2020).\\n\\nAlthough there are many studies on discourse markers and corresponding pragmatic functions in some Romance languages, e.g., French, Spanish, or Italian (Crible and Pascual, 2020; Lansari, 2019; Cristofaro and Badan, 2019), there are not so many on Romanian (Ionescu, 2020; \u015etefanescu et al., 2020; Popescu et al., 2020). The current studies only analyze the pragmatic functions of some of these markers from a linguistic perspective. Unfortunately, large-scale computational linguistic studies for this language are lacking in the current literature. Ionescu (2020) proposes the analysis of a sub-category of discourse markers, i.e., topic shifters, from a contrastive perspective, in the Romanian language. The study also compares the strategies of topic shifting in Romanian with their French counterparts, using parallel corpora consisting of 150 discourse markers occurrences. A comprehensive analysis of two synonymous Romanian discourse markers and their main features is discussed in \u015etefanescu et al. (2020). The authors use a corpus of 150 annotated sample sentences to study the main functionalities and discourse patterns of *de altfel* and *de altminteri* (as a matter of fact, in fact, indeed). The Romanian adverb *atunci* (then) has suffered discursive values changes over time, from a temporal adverb to a polyfunctional discourse marker (Popescu et al., 2020). By employing the CoRoLa corpus and CORPES, the authors compare *atunci* with its Spanish counterpart *entonces*.\\n\\nIn European Portuguese, there is a relatively small corpus of spoken discourse manually annotated following PDTB annotation principles (TED-PT) (Zeyrek et al., 2020). In this corpus, several implicit and explicit discourse markers are attributed a meaning by means of coherence relations. A lexicon of discourse markers was also created for European Portuguese (LDM-PT) (Mendes et al., 2018) within the project of TextLink. In Connective-Lex (Stede et al., 2019) discourse markers are annotated with discourse relations in addition to the syntactic and lexicographic information.\\n\\nBulgarian corpora with discourse markers annotations are sparse. We find collections of several examples with intonation marking of discourse markers in BulPhonC (Hateva et al., 2016), and collections of text corpora, such as the Bulgarian National Corpus (Kocheva et al., 2011), and the Bulgarian-English Parallel TreeBank Simov et al. (2011), that do not contain specific information about discourse markers or their roles. The corpus of annotated examples for discourse markers presence or absence from TED talks that is reported in this paper is the first systematic work on creating such an annotated corpus with discourse markers for Bulgarian. In the course of the current effort a Macedonian and Hebrew language corpora with examples of TED talks annotated for the presence and absence of discourse markers have also been created.\\n\\nCorpora of Polish with annotated discourse markers are scarce as well. Probably the best known is the corpus of spoken language dubbed *Gesprochene Wissenschafts Sprache Kontrastiv*, available in four languages, Polish among them (also in German, English, and Bulgarian), which amounts to 760,000 words in size and is based on 92 hours of recordings. It contains annotation of discourse phenomena in texts illustrating academic interaction, and it is also PoS tagged, lemmatized, time-aligned and orthographically transcribed (available at clarin.eu).\\n\\n3. Annotation scheme\\n\\nThe design of the annotation scheme followed a main requirement: suitability for representing the meaning of discourse markers across different languages. On the one hand, since the discourse markers extracted from the corpus served two different functions, either establishing coherence relations or conveying interactional purposes, the tag set had to properly account for their relational and non-relational uses (Crible, 2016). On the other hand, due to the multilingual nature of the corpus, the annotation scheme had to be comprehensive enough to cover different language specificities. Despite the existence of many corpus-based frameworks, like RST (Mann and Thompson, 1988), CCR (Sanders et al., 1992), SDRT (Asher et al., 2003), PDTB (Prasad et al., 2008), and of several taxonomies, such as the ones proposed by Cuenca (2013) and Crible and Zufferey (2015), being interoperability and language-independence key factors, we deemed it best to opt for ISO 24617 - Language resource management \u2013 Semantic annotation framework (SemAF), which provides semantic annotation schemes with extensive coverage.

Assuming that there are evident compatibilities across the semantic description of discourse relations in the different frameworks, which enables mapping between them, ISO 24617-8 defines an interoperable set of low-level semantic discourse relations according to the meaning of the relation's arguments. These discourse relations are divided into two types: symmetric, whenever the two arguments assume relation-specific semantic role, and asymmetric, whenever the arguments take the same semantic role. This part of ISO 24617 adequately represents the meaning of discourse markers that establish a relation between the content of two arguments, as illustrated by Example 1 from the English dataset.\\n\\nExample 1. For every ton of cement that's manufactured, almost a ton of CO2 is emitted into the atmosphere. As a result, the cement industry is the second-largest industrial emitter of CO2, responsible for almost eight percent of total global emissions. In this example, the two arguments are linked by the discourse relation Cause, signaled by the discourse marker as a result. Thus, Arg2 (in italics) bears the semantic role of reason, while Arg1 (in bold) plays the semantic role of result.\\n\\nThe problem arose when we tried to apply this annotation scheme to examples with discourse markers that fulfil an interactional function, as exemplified in Example 2.\\n\\nExample 2. Here's a project called \u201cJust Landed\u201d, where I'm looking at people tweeting on Twitter. \u201cHey! I just landed in Hawaii!\u201d \u2013 you know, how people just casually try to sneakrtion that into their Twitter. In this case, the discourse marker you know is clearly different from as a result from the previous example. Instead of relating the meaning of two arguments, it intervenes in an interpersonal domain being used to manage the relation between speaker-listener (Crible, 2014). Therefore, the value of discourse markers such as this one cannot be properly described within ISO 24617-8.\\n\\nInspired in the plug-in interface designed for the second edition of Language resources management \u2013 Semantic annotation framework (SemAF) \u2013 Part 2: Dialogue acts (2020) (Bunt (2019); Bunt et al. (2020)), we decided to add a similar mechanism to our annotation scheme, but working in the inverse direction, that is, from the discourse relations set to the dialogue acts set. The second version of ISO 24617-2 (ISO, 2020) puts forward a wide-ranging metamodel for the annotation of dialogue acts that includes dimensions, communicative functions and qualifiers. As anticipated by the standard, there may be the need to customize the annotation scheme by simplifying it to the specific needs of the project, and that is what we considered to be the best path bearing in mind that our aim was to represent the meaning of discourse markers. So, whenever the annotation requires the use of the plug-in interface, only the communicative function should be identified, and, if it is relevant, the qualifier should also be registered. This means that the segmentation of the dialogue acts, the identification of the participants and of the dialogue act dimension were left out. Accordingly, in Example 2, the discourse marker you know would be annotated with checkQuestion, a general purpose function part of the information-seeking functions.\\n\\nFigure 1 summarizes our proposal and Figure 2 and Table 1 specify the discourse relations, communicative functions and qualifiers that integrate our model.\\n\\nFigure 1: Annotation scheme\\nFigure 2: Set of Discourse Relations (Bunt and Prasad, 2016)\\n\\nTo sum up, the framework that we propose includes a host annotation scheme based on ISO 24617-8 (DR-core) and an annotation plug-in to ISO 24617-2 (DA), thus combining two standardized means to represent the discourse markers' meaning.\\n\\n4. Multilingual parallel corpus\\n\\nThe multilingual corpus that we present in this paper contains data from nine languages: English, Lithuanian, Bulgarian, German, Macedonian, Romanian, Hebrew, Portuguese and Polish, using the publicly available TED Talk transcripts. TED Talks are spoken monologues that employ a great deal of communicative instruments to render the presentation lively and interactive. This includes abundant use of discourse markers whose roles are of interest to our study. The constitution of the multilingual corpus is an ongoing expansion of TED-EHL parallel corpus LINDAT/CLARIN-\"}"}

Each bilingual pair contains aligned examples in English and in another language, based on the occurrence of a MWE potentially in the role of discourse marker, defined according to theoretical insights by Schiffrin (2001); Fraser (2009b); Crible (2014), among others. In other words, in this work, we consider discourse markers to be not only connectives, conjunctions, but also verbs and lexicalized expressions with verbs, used to link the content of utterances or to express the stance of the speaker.\\n\\nIt is important to point out that many of the selected multiword discourse markers in our corpus are ambiguous, e.g. they can be discourse markers or content expressions depending on the context in which they occur. Such expressions are you see, you know, that is, that can be either clauses, or discourse markers, as shown in Examples 3 and 4.\\n\\nExample 3. You can see (content expression) areas where neuronal cell bodies are being stained. And what you can see is it's very non-uniform.\\n\\nExample 4. So you see (discourse marker), we're navigating the web for the first time.\\n\\nTo render the corpus homogeneous and uniform for experimenting the ISO-based annotation, all eight datasets of language pairs have been compared and the matching examples across all of them identified and extracted. Thus, we came up with an intersection of 55 unique matching contexts across all nine languages out of a total of 44192 distinct textual contexts for English, representing the union of the English examples from all eight language pairs. This amounts to a total of 495 examples in the set of the nine languages that were annotated with the ISO-based annotation scheme. We deem this corpus size satisfactory as our annotation effort is the first attempt to produce ISO-based annotations of discourse markers, in addition to match them across nine languages.\\n\\nThe use of TED talks and their translations permits building a parallel corpus and studying contrastively the different languages. The multilingual consistently annotated corpus makes it possible to compare discourse annotated translated texts with the English discourse annotated source text in order to analyze different languages of the text, as well as to understand translation trends. Such analysis offers a better perspective of comparative studies because the same type of texts is used for annotation (eg. Zufferey (2004)). Text-type similarity is a major advantage in analyzing language discourse relations/ communicative functions and discourse markers. The other important usage scenario of multilingual discourse annotations is where cross-lingual data is being applied to languages that do not provide any native discourse annotations or only at a very small scale as is the case of Macedonian, Bulgarian, European Portuguese, Hebrew, Polish, and Romanian.\\n\\nAlthough the pivot language is English, and the aligned examples in the other languages are the translations of the contexts where there is a multiword discourse marker in English, in fact, the former are not mere literal translations, which could result in non-naturalistic texts. As shown in section 6, the parallel corpus allows us to observe particularities with regards to the type and distribution of discourse markers in each language. For instance, discourse markers in English are in some cases omitted in the other languages, or translated by others with different characteristics.\\n\\nAnother relevant aspect of our corpus worth referring to is its monologic nature. As is well known, TED talks are spoken monologues, which does not mean that they are devoid of interactional discourse markers. In spite of being less frequent, they are indeed present, which is also a challenge for our annotation scheme, in particular in what concerns the plug-in to ISO 24617-2, because this part of ISO was designed primarily to account for dialogues, and not monologues.\\n\\n5. Annotation process\\n\\nThe structure of the data in the bilingual datasets provides tables with shorter sentence chunks and larger contexts where a multiword discourse marker appears, the identified discourse marker expression aligned in English and in the other language, a classification of the occurrence of the expression as discourse marker or not, and the following breakdown of categorization of the examples, based on the adopted annotation scheme, combining ISO 24617-8 for discourse relations representation and ISO 24617-2 for communicative functions representation. Figure 3 shows the structure of the annotation table.\\n\\nThe analysis of each example of the dataset requires estimation whether the multiword discourse marker...\"}"}

As a consequence, the string describing the discourse marker in the example is recorded in the field Discourse marker, while the parts of the text describing the first and the second arguments of the assigned discourse relation are recorded in the fields Arg1 and Arg2. The recording of the ISO discourse relation role and of the roles of its arguments is provided in the following three fields: Discourse relation (ISO), Arg 1 role, Arg 2 role. Finally, the last two fields in the table are dedicated for the assignment of ISO communicative roles, e.g. dialogue acts and qualifiers, Communicative function (ISO) and Qualifier, as shown in Figure 3. Accordingly, Example 1 would be annotated as in Figure 4.\\n\\nAs a result, One of the byproducts of that process is carbon dioxide, or CO2. For every ton of cement that's manufactured, almost a ton of CO2 is emitted into the atmosphere. As a result, the cement industry is the second-largest industrial emitter of CO2, responsible for almost eight percent of total global emissions.

So, if the discourse marker was of a relational nature, the annotator had to identify the arguments, the discourse relation that linked both arguments and, in case of asymmetric discourse relations, the arguments role. When the discourse marker had an interactional meaning, the annotator had to identify its communicative function and, if pertinent, the appropriate qualifier.\\n\\nAfter designing the annotation scheme, a manual of annotation with instructions, definitions and illustrative examples was prepared. The following step was the annotation of the English dataset by a linguist, which worked as gold standard. Next, the 55 parallel text segments with discourse markers from each language pair was annotated by one native speaker (all authors of this paper) following the annotation guidelines. Although the annotators work in different field of expertise - either Linguistics, Computer Science, or both -, all have been developing research about discourse markers. Whenever the annotators encountered some difficulties or issues not included in the annotation manual, these were addressed by the group and a solution was agreed on.\\n\\n6. Discussion and Results\\n\\nThis section presents the results of the annotation process along with discussion of different phenomena single and cross-language and evidence issued from the linguistic analysis carried out while interpreting and applying the ISO 24617-8 for discourse relations and the plug-in to ISO 24617-2 for communicative functions determination and assignment. The aim of this section is not so much to provide a quantitative systematic and detailed analysis of the annotation results as to give an overall description of the different phenomena we encountered. The quantitative analysis will be carried out on larger sets of data. The main objective of the paper is to present a multilingual parallel corpus for discourse markers as evidence that a combination of ISO 25617-8 with ISO 25617-2 can account for the semantic and pragmatic values of discourse makers.\\n\\nBaseline\\n\\nAs English has been a pivot language for all language pairs of our corpus, a baseline annotation has been provided for the English examples. This annotation abides the principles set for the annotation scheme to either assign an ISO discourse relation, or ISO communicative function/qualifier, or both when required, to the discourse marker of the example. Additionally, the examples have been annotated with information whether the string of the MWE identified in the text has actually the role of discourse marker or not. Out of the 55 examples, 11 have turned to contain a MWE that is actually not uttered as discourse marker in the text, as shown in Example 5 below, conversely to Example 6, where the expression you know is uttered as discourse marker.\\n\\nExample 5.

As it will become clear in the following paragraphs, the work on this multilingual corpus has come up with a series of interesting phenomena with respect to the expression of discourse markers, discourse relations and communicative functions in the different languages, on the one hand, and with respect to the determination and assignment of proper ISO defined tags for each single example.\\n\\nOmissions.\\n\\nWhen looking at the cross language examples contrastively, several generalizations appear. Lexicalized expression of discourse markers as MWE in English can disappear in any given target language, but the discourse relation it conveys remains present. In these cases, the discourse relation is established by grammatical means, e.g., modal adverbs in German; modal verbs and questions in Bulgarian; changes in the word order in the languages where this is possible, for instance, in German to convey most commonly contrast or continuity; and other grammatical and phrasal variations, like in Hebrew, the discourse marker *in fact* is expressed by a personal pronoun, such as \u05de\u05b5\u05de/\u05d3\u05e8\u05b9\u05d5 (and) \u05de\u05b5\u05de/\u05dc\u05d0\u05d7\u05d5\u05e9\u05d1\u05d9\u05dc\u05b7\u05e0\u05b4 (and he).\\n\\nLexical variations of the discourse markers are also abundant. For instance, the discourse marker *in fact* in European Portuguese occurs as the direct translation (de facto), but also as na verdade (in true). There are also instances where in English the discourse marker is a multiword expression and in the targeted languages it is used a single word discourse marker like pavyzd\u017eiui in Lithuanian.\\n\\nDifferent discourse relations/communicative functions and different discourse markers in one and the same context across languages.\\n\\nThe first observation when comparing the baseline annotations to the single examples of the other eight languages is that the identified discourse relations and communicative functions in the English set of examples do not correspond always to their juxtaposed counterparts in the parallel datasets. For example, a discourse relation expansion, expressed with the MWE *in fact* in the English text (Ex. 7) occurs as conveying the communicative function confirm in the Bulgarian text, reflected by the utterance\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0438\u043b\u043d\u043e (right), (Ex. 8), while in German and Lithuanian it remains expansion signaled by the expressions tats\u00e4chlich, tats\u00e4\u00dflicka sakant. In Hebrew, while in this example (i.e., Ex. 7) the same discourse relation remains (\u05d3\u05ea\u05e0\u05e4\u05e4/\u05d3\u05e8\u05b9\u05d5 \u05de\u05b5\u05de/\u05d3\u05e8\u05b9\u05d5), a similar text with the same MWE *in fact* (Ex. 10) is replaced by the exemplification relation (\u05d3\u05ea\u05e0\u05e4\u05e4/\u05dc\u05d3\u05d5\u05d2\u05de\u05d4\u05d3\u05e8\u05b9\u05d5, Ex. 11).\\n\\nExample 7.\\n\\nBut most people don\u2019t agree.

These are of course confirm, for example as exemplification, in particular as elaboration and in other words as restatement. They are consistently present in the examples of the other eight languages and convey the same discourse relation. In some languages like Romanian, restatement discourse relation is referred to with other expressions, such as adic\u02d8 a (that is).\\n\\nSubjective vs. neutral speaker's stance expression in different languages. Speaking of that is, we touch upon another phenomenon that is worth noting. The English expression I mean implies clear subjectivity by introducing an element of speaker's stance or attitude towards what has been said. This expression has been conveyed in the European Portuguese equivalent with the neutral isto \u00e9 (that is) with respect to the speaker's stance expression. The Romanian de fapt (in fact) and its equivalent in other languages or of course and its equivalents also convey a nuance of speaker's attitude.\\n\\nExpression of communicative functions and discourse relations in a single utterance. The cross-lingual analysis showed that there are cases where the discourse marker conveys both a discourse relation and a communicative function. For example, the discourse marker of course can signal a discourse relation of expansion, and simultaneously, express the communicative function confirm with the qualifier certain, as it is the case of the Portuguese example (Ex. 15), the translation of the English (Ex. 16).\\n\\nExample 15.

(PT)\\n\\nExample 16. Instead, so far, the measurements coming from the LHC show no signs of new particles or unexpected phenomena. Of course, the verdict is not definitive. (EN)\\n\\nIt is important to note that such correlations between discourse relations and communicative functions are worth studying as they provide sufficient ground for generalizations.\\n\\nThis non-exhaustive list of the cross-lingual and interpretation phenomena gives a glance at the complexity and the interest in carrying this experimental pioneering effort of applying in practice the ISO annotation standard guidelines to a multilingual corpus composed of languages from different language families.\\n\\nAlthough the sample is rather small, it is evidence that the scheme that we propose is able to successfully represent the relational and interactional meaning of discourse markers across languages.\\n\\n7. Conclusion and Future work\\n\\nOur paper presents an ISO-based annotated multilingual corpus for discourse markers annotated with discourse relations and communicative roles, which we intend to publish in CLARIN. We propose an annotation scheme that combines two parts of ISO 24617, Part 8 for discourse relations with a plug-in to Part 2 for communicative functions and qualifiers. To assert the feasibility of the designed scheme, we carried out an experiment by applying it to a set of examples from a multilingual parallel corpus that comprises nine languages, English, Lithuanian, Bulgarian, German, Macedonian, Romanian, Hebrew, Portuguese and Polish, from the publicly available TED Talk transcripts.\\n\\nThe annotation of 55 examples for each language (495 examples in total) enabled some conclusions regarding the annotation scheme. First, we can conclude that, although ISO 24617-8 presents only the core discourse relations, overall, they can account for the semantic use of the discourse markers occurring in our corpus. Nevertheless, there are some instances for which new, or more specific, discourse relations are needed. For instance, the discourse relation expansion covers different meaning relations, and, therefore, should be divided into more distinct discourse relations. For these reasons, as future work, we will extend the list of discourse relations so that they can properly represent the discourse markers' meaning cross-linguistically.\\n\\nAnother problem that we encountered concerns the Attribution discourse relation. ISO 24617-8 does not include it in the set of discourse relations, and ISO 24617-6 suggests a separate layer for its annotation. In our corpus, several examples of Attribution come about signaled by what some authors consider to be also discourse markers, like I think. In this first experiment, we decided not to proceed with the annotation of this type of discourse markers. However, due to its frequency, and relevance, in the future, we intend to add a separate layer to codify this information.\\n\\nAs follow-up, we will focus on the automatic identification of discourse markers, extraction of discourse relations, and identification of their arguments in line with what has been done within shared tasks such as DISRPT 2019 and 2021 editions (Zeldes et al. (2019); Zeldes et al. (2021)), and work on the representation of the ISO-based annotation scheme as LLOD, extending (Chiarcos and Ionov, 2021), to enable further semantic processing of discourse relations and communicative functions.\\n\\n8.
