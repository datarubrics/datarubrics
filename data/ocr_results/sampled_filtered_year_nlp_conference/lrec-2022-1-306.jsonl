Storing in a database\\n\\nDocumentation, interlinking, and geotagging of the corpus were performed via a platform that was ultimately used for storing and searching the corpus. On selecting the best foundation for our Content Management System (CMS), our primary concerns were wide usage, maturity, and continuity of the platforms used, while open source was another major focus. All the above combined also lead to security and minimal maintenance cost of our own platform. Thus, PHP was chosen on the backend, a Bootstrap derived CSS framework for styling, the Leaflet JS library for geocoding and other well-known utilities for user input validation, ease of access and interactivity. We opted for a purpose-built CMS over an established one. As a matter of fact, already existing CMS platforms also fully satisfy our concerns mentioned above. However, much of their complexity is not required in our use case. Moreover, some of the functionalities we require are provided through third party plugins, which do not necessarily share the same integrity. Thus, we felt safer developing our own system based on well-founded tools, rather than committing to, following, and evaluating several ready-made solutions. By doing so, we got significant gains in speed and resource utilization.\\n\\nFigure 1: The main database schema\\n\\nThe platform follows the database schema and provides a menu containing the main data elements of the corpus: myths, reference texts, artistic representations, mythological figures (people), multimedia files and POIs. For each of these entities, the platform provides a common management mechanism. A table representation of already stored elements (Fig. 3), a form for editing purposes (Fig. 4), and a similar but empty form for data entry purposes. The use of this straight model of functionality provides easy understanding of the platforms' use, since project members who were responsible for storing and documenting the multimodal content, lacked adequate experience in content management applications.\\n\\nFigure 2: Table representation of content for the Points of Interest\\n\\nAll forms consist of several input text fields, some WYSIWYG editor fields, in cases we need formatted text, for all metadata applied to the selected corpus element. Interconnections with another element were provided using enriched dropdown elements. In the case of POIs, we also included a geotagging functionality which will be described in the next section. In some cases, where interconnections required a one-to-many relation and the nature of related elements was not easily expressed by a single title, we used separate table areas, providing more than one field of related metadata (Fig. 5).\\n\\nFigure 3: Editing form for a stored point of interest.\\n\\nFor security purposes and establishing a content quality control, our CMS uses a two-level user hierarchical system. At the lower level, annotators are granted access to all corpus elements and can create, edit, and delete their own records. Editors, on the other hand, have the same access to system functionalities, but also the right to publish completed records.

Those consist merely of foreign keys to the referred entities. No distinct primary key is used on them, instead their primary key is composed of foreign keys only. This practically transforms them into an index. It ensures that no duplicates are inserted as this is a violation of the primary key. Furthermore, by utilizing constrains on the foreign keys we maintain the integrity of the database in case one of the connected entities is deleted.\\n\\nI.e., most modern database systems support the \\\"on delete cascade\\\" constraint on foreign keys. This, in combination with the usage of intermediate tables allows us to automatically remove all relationships, upon deletion, without affecting the referred entities and without the need to manually trace all relations.\\n\\n6. Geo-tagging: placing the data on the map\\n\\nBesides the documentation of the cultural content, and the linguistic annotation added, one novel feature of the corpus is the fact that part of the textual data has been geotagged manually. More precisely, textual data that pertain to the domain of Travel, that is, POI entries, are assigned geographical coordinates. In our case, to represent the geographic data stored in the Mythotopia corpus, OpenStreetMap was used. OpenStreetMap allows distribution of free geospatial data that can be used by anyone. We also used Leaflet (https://leafletjs.com/), which is a light, open-source JavaScript library that works efficiently across all major desktop and mobile platforms.\\n\\nAnnotation at this level is quite straightforward and no other expertise is required besides familiarity with the CMS. From the re, annotators can easily depict a specific place on the map in two ways:\\n\\n- By interacting with the map and clicking on the corresponding place. Annotators can adjust the zoom of the map as well as pan to the area on which they intend to place the marker. They can also delete the marker and place a new one in case of mistake.\\n- By using the \\\"Forward & Reverse Geocoding\\\" API, based on OpenStreetMap data. The specific API converts addresses into geocoordinates and vice versa: it uses reverse geocoding to cast geographic coordinates into human-readable addresses or toponyms. In the latter case, the annotators can type the coordinates in to the corresponding text field and the API returns the name of the place\u2014if found. The annotator can then click on the option provided and the details of the place are shown. If this is the correct place, the annotator confirms the choice, and a marker is shown on the map. Alternatively, annotators can start typing the name of the place they wish to depict on the map, and the API returns a list of places found. The annotator can then choose one of the places shown and confirm its coordinates.\\n\\nThen the corresponding marker is shown on the map. In both cases, after the marker shown on the map is saved, the geographic data are successfully stored in the database in GeoJson format. GeoJson is a format that is used for encoding a variety of geographic data structures using JavaScript Object Notation (JSON). It features may include point, line strings, polygon, circle, or multipart collections of previously mentioned features.\\n\\nFigure 6: GeoJson format example\\n\\nBeyond the aforementioned functionalities for populating and geo-tagging the Mythotopia corpus, our work includes developing methods for semi-automatic enrichment of existing geospatial resources (POIs) with third party, open datasets. In particular, we are currently leveraging our previous work on toponym interlinking (Giannopoulos et al., 2021), by adapting the initially proposed similarity functions and machine learning training features in order to perform effectively on Greek toponyms and POIs. Our goal is to exploit these methods to enrich the core, manually gathered POIs of the Mythotopia corpus with metadata for the same entities, identified in third data sources, as for example Geonames and ToposText.\\n\\nMore precisely, Geonames is a large, global toponym dataset that contains circa 36 thousand place names in Greece. For each toponym, Geonames provides an extensive list of alternative location names. Thus, it comprises a valuable resource to be interlinked/integrated in to our corpus, especially considering that several Greek places are represented by more than one names. Similarly, ToposText is a dedicated collection of places, ancient texts, and named entities related to the Greek history and mythology. Interlinking our corpus with ToposText will allow us to enrich the former with new metadata on myths regarding, e.g., related entities such as persons, locations, events.\\n\\n7. Creating routes\\n\\nIn sightseeing scenarios, specifying a travel itinerary is essential for satisfying the travelers\u2019 preferences (e.g., means of transport) and restrictions (e.g., time limitations). However, even in cases of visiting only a few sites, the task of travel planning is challenging, since in most cases the travelers are not familiar with the road network and the local public transportation (Bast et al., 2016; Taylor, Lim, and Chan, 2018; Lopes, Coelho, and Santos, 2016; Tenemaza et al., 2020, Kaffes et al., 2018).\"}"}

In a nutshell, the user provides a starting and an ending location, as well as a set of POIs which they wish to visit. The system generates a route which comprises road segments/paths that need to be followed by the user, to visit all the desired POIs in a nearly optimal order. To do so, the system integrates several transportation networks (e.g., road networks, railways, boat routes) to generate routes based on different means of transport. These networks are extracted from OpenStreetMap, which is an open-source dataset, widely used in location-based services. The implemented routing system generates routes based on the following criteria:\\n\\n(a) Route optimization objective. It defines the criterion which is attempted to be optimized during the route computation. It allows two options: Route Length and Traveling Time. Route Length corresponds to the overall length of the route, measured in meters. So, in this mode, the route is the shortest path that passes over all desired POIs. Traveling Time corresponds to the time that the user is expected to spend to travel along the whole route. The time is calculated by considering the length of the route and the expected traveling speeds in the different road segments of the underlying road network.\\n\\n(b) Travel type. It defines the means of transport to be used in the route, allowing three options: Driving, Walking, and Transit (e.g., train, boat). Travel Type determines the transport network on top of which the route is computed. For example, the transport network used in the Walking type contains the streets and the paths that pedestrians can use, while highways are omitted.\\n\\n(c) Visiting order mode. It allows the user to select whether they prefer: (i) to visit the desired POIs in a specific order, or (ii) to allow the algorithm to find a nearly optimal order of visitation, with respect to optimizing the Route optimization objective (a).\\n\\n(d) Approximate route mode. It allows to adjust whether the route computation algorithm focuses on performance (speed of computation) or optimal quality (finding the shortest/fastest route). Selecting the approximate route mode, the generated route may not be the optimal, with respect to the route optimization objective (although it will be close enough), but its computation will be performed very fast. The approximate route mode enables the generation of routes that involve large number of POIs in a very short time. This mode is a great solution for interactive applications where low response time is essential.\\n\\nThe routing functionality involves the combination of shortest path algorithms, e.g., Dijkstra (Dijkstra, 1959), multi-criteria optimizations, approximation methods, and techniques for efficient route generation. Our implementation is mainly based on the methods proposed in our previous work in (Kaffes et al., 2018), which allows efficient route planning over multiple POIs. The main idea of the implemented method is the following. Initially, we identify an adequate subset of the transportation network that is guaranteed to contain, among others, the optimal route for the user's input. This way, parts of the road network are pruned, reducing the search space of the algorithm, and enabling the efficient route generation. To identify this network's subset, optimal paths (i.e., paths that optimize the Route optimization objective) between all possible POI pairs are computed using the Dijkstra algorithm over the network. Then, the resulting paths are merged, constructing a new network, i.e., an overlay network. This procedure guarantees that the optimal path is included in the generated network. Using the new network, a modified Dijkstra algorithm that finds an optimal path for the desired POIs visitation is used, to return the final route to the end user.\"}"}
