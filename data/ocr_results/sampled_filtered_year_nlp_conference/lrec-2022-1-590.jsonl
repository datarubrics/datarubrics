Unlike other areas within the US where language contact has been widely documented (e.g., the Southwest), Spanish\u2013English bilingualism in the Midwest has been understudied despite an increase in its Hispanic population. The BILinMID Corpus contains short stories narrated in Spanish and in English by 72 speakers representing different types of bilinguals: early simultaneous bilinguals, early sequential bilinguals, and late second language learners. All stories have been transcribed and annotated using various natural language processing tools. Additionally, a user interface has also been created to facilitate searching for specific patterns in the corpus as well as to filter out results according to specified criteria. Guidelines and procedures followed to create the corpus and the user interface are described in detail in the paper. The corpus is fully available online and it might be particularly interesting for researchers working on language variation and contact.\\n\\nKeywords: Bilingualism, Language contact, Bilingual corpora\\n\\n1. Introduction\\nThe Hispanic population in the United States makes up to 15\u201320% of the nation's total population currently, and it is expected to continue growing in the next few decades (Pew Research Center, 2008). Due to its proximity to the US\u2013Mexico border, Hispanics have more presence in the Southwest of the country (US Census, 2015), a situation that has inspired numerous studies on language contact and bilingualism in that area (e.g., Silva-Corval\u00e1n, 1994; Teschner, 2009; Travis et al., 2017). The predominance of the Southwest is also reflected in the few available corpora that document Spanish\u2013English bilingualism in the United States (Gironzetti, 2021, 2022), which leave other US areas underrepresented in those datasets. The Bilinguals in the Midwest (BILinMID) Corpus constitutes an attempt to document the Spanish and English spoken in an area that has not received much attention in the literature but where the presence of Hispanics is certainly considerable, especially in recent years (Potowski, 2020).\\n\\nThe creation of a text corpus such as BILinMID has important implications. On the one hand, the corpus serves as a pedagogical resource, since it can make learners value local language varieties and view them as a relevant source of learning. This is especially important in the case of Spanish, as US varieties of this language are often stigmatized (Hill, 1998). On the other hand, because the Midwest has a smaller bilingual population than other US regions, the corpus allows researchers interested in language contact, variation, and acquisition to better understand how the degree of societal bilingualism influences linguistic phenomena. For example, researchers could compare data from BILinMID to data from speakers living in highly bilingual regions (documented in other corpora from the US). This need to compare Spanish\u2013English speakers across the nation living in different bilingual settings has already been pointed out by some scholars (Fuller and Leeman, 2020; Lynch, 2017). Likewise, the use of corpora for sociolinguistic research has also been underscored (D\u00edaz-Campos and Torres, 2018). To this end, the BILinMID Corpus has a functional user interface that allows researchers without a technical background to easily explore the corpus. This paper describes the process of creating the BILinMID Corpus as well as its user interface. It also reviews other available Spanish\u2013English corpora from the US.\\n\\n2. Related Work\\nEven though some corpora have been created to document the speech of Spanish\u2013English bilinguals in the US (Table 1), most of them were compiled to investigate the use of Spanish in the country. Thus, in these corpora, English is only present in those cases where speakers code-switch.

The corpus contains the video, audio, and transcription from each interview. Additionally, POS-tagged annotations are provided separately and can be explored using Google Data Studio. The second largest corpus is the Corpus of Spanish in Southern Arizona (Carvalho, 2012), comprised of 76 individual sociolinguistic interviews. Both the audios and transcripts are available to researchers, as well as the metadata. A third important corpus is the Miami Corpus (Deuchar, 2011), which includes 56 audio recordings of 84 Spanish\u2013English bilinguals having conversations. Both the audios and the transcriptions can be downloaded in different formats for further analysis. A smaller corpus is the Corpus of Mexican Spanish in Salinas (Brown, 2022), containing only 11 individual interviews with first-\"}"}

Transcriptions have been annotated using TreeTagger and can be explored using a simple user interface.\\n\\nBesides these corpora, there are two others which are more general but that also include speech samples from the speakers under consideration here. The first is the New England Corpus of Heritage and Second Language Speakers (Amaral and Gubitosi, 2013), which also includes data from second language learners, contrary to other corpora. This corpus includes both oral and written speech samples.\\n\\nLastly, the Polinsky Language Sciences Lab Dataverse (Polinsky, 2015) is a data repository of speech samples by multiple types of speakers and languages. Some of them are Spanish-English bilinguals whose oral narratives were collected for different research projects and which are now available online to other researchers.\\n\\n3. Speakers and Data Collection\\n\\nThe BILinMID Corpus is a bilingual comparable corpus of approximately 35,000 tokens which contains short stories narrated in English and in Spanish. Even though the stories were narrated orally by the speakers, only the texts corresponding to the transcriptions are part of the corpus (and not the audio recordings).\\n\\nTo create a corpus that was representative of the bilingual population in the Midwest, three groups of bilinguals were targeted: early simultaneous bilinguals, early sequential bilinguals, and late second language learners. The first two groups are usually referred to in the literature as 'heritage speakers' (Montrul, 2016; Vald\u00e9s, 2000). However, this term is not used in the corpus due to being too broad. The terminology chosen instead better reflects the specific language developmental pattern of each group of speakers, which is more informative.\\n\\nIn order to collect data for the corpus, speakers were contacted through ads on social media, local organizations, and personal contacts. The data collection process took place in two sessions with at least two weeks in between sessions (Figure 1). This was done to prevent the first narrative from influencing the second narrative.\\n\\nFigure 1: Data collection process\\n\\nSpeakers were recorded in a quiet and familiar space, usually in their office or at home. Speakers saw images depicting a famous children's fairy tale, Little Red Riding Hood. As they saw the images, they had to narrate the story orally in their own words. This fairy tale was chosen because it has been frequently used in research projects examining Spanish-English bilingualism in the US (Cuza et al., 2013; Montrul, 2004, 2010). Storytelling tasks such as this one promote natural speech and are a good source of linguistic phenomena (Kisselev, 2021; Schmid, 2011).\\n\\nIn the first session, speakers narrated the story in one language, and in the second session, they narrated the story in the other language (this was counterbalanced across participants). However, there were several instances of code-switching in the narratives. Lastly, even though a researcher was always present in the room, speakers were instructed not to interact with them at all while narrating the story. All narratives were recorded on the researcher's laptop using the Audacity software (Audacity Team, 2021) and speakers had full control of the images while narrating the story, since they could go forward or backward whenever they wanted to.\\n\\nIn addition to narrating the story in one of the languages, in the first session, speakers were also asked to fill out a questionnaire to gather more information about the demographics and linguistic background of each group. Furthermore, the questionnaire included a section where speakers completed the Bilingual Language Profile (BLP) (Birdsong et al., 2012), a standardized test to measure language dominance in the two languages. The BLP test consists of several multiple-choice questions that produce a final score ranging from -218 to 218. A score of 0 indicates balanced bilingualism (i.e., the speaker is equally dominant in Spanish as in English). A negative score indicates the speaker is more dominant in English than in Spanish, and a positive score indicates the speaker is more dominant in Spanish than in English. The inclusion of the BLP test responds to the need of reporting some sort of language proficiency or dominance metric in corpora containing speech from bilinguals (Kisselev, 2021).\\n\\nThe full questionnaire was hosted online on Qualtrics (Qualtrics, 2005) so that speakers could fill it out conveniently from their smartphone or tablet. Based on the answers to the questionnaire, there were 7 early simultaneous bilinguals (5 females, 2 males), 40 early sequential bilinguals (31 females, 9 males), and 25 late second language learners (18 females, 7 males).\\n\\nSpeakers from the first two groups were all second-generation immigrants (i.e., either born in the US to at least one parent from a Spanish-speaking country, or born in a Spanish-speaking country and moved to the US with their parents before the age of 5). Simultaneous bilinguals had only one parent of Hispanic origin, which explains why they started speaking both Spanish and English simultaneously from birth. All sequential bilinguals, on the other hand, started speaking Spanish before English. In this latter case, either both their parents were from a Spanish-speaking country and continued speaking only Spanish at home while in the US, or the speaker was born in a Spanish-speaking country and moved to the US at a very young age.\\n\\nRegarding the group of late second language learners, all speakers were first-generation immigrants. Speakers in this group were raised monolingually in a Spanish-speaking country and moved to the US after puberty. They learned English as adults and, at the time they were recorded, they all had lived in the US for at least ten years (mean length of residence in the US: 17.68 years) and used English frequently on a daily basis.\\n\\nThe linguistic background of speakers is also reflected in their BLP scores, with the group of early simultaneous bilinguals being clearly more dominant in English than in Spanish, and the group of late second language learners being more dominant in Spanish than in English, overall (Table 2).\"}"}

Information about the speakers' linguistic background and demographics was stored in a table format in a .csv file. This file was later used for the user interface (see section 6).\\n\\n4. Transcription Process\\n\\nAll audio recordings with the short stories were transcribed using CLAN (MacWhinney, 2000). CLAN is an open-source software widely used in the language sciences. It consists of an editor where audio files can be imported, segmented, and easily transcribed thanks to its several features. Some of the corpora previously reviewed have also used CLAN in their transcription process (e.g., the Miami Corpus). The software uses the CHAT format for transcription (producing .cha files), which involves adding some special symbols to the transcribed text in order to provide more detail (e.g., pauses, hesitations, repetitions) as well as a header with information from the speaker (Figure 2).\\n\\nFor the BILinMID Corpus, the April 2021 version of the CHAT manual was used. Figure 2: A transcription in the CHAT format. The CHAT format also allows to mark errors as such. However, for this corpus, errors were left unmarked unless the transcribed word (or group of words) was difficult to interpret (e.g., if the speaker made up a new word). The motivation behind this choice is that the notion of 'error' is prescriptive and might offend some of the speakers whose narratives were recorded for this corpus. When working with these populations, this terminology should be avoided.\\n\\nFurthermore, since the goal of this corpus is to simply provide a descriptive account of how Spanish-English bilinguals speak in the Midwest, error marking is not necessary. Three researchers participated in the transcription process, all of them Spanish-English bilinguals familiar with the language varieties of the Midwest and with a solid background in linguistics. Even though all researchers followed the same guidelines and often discussed transcription issues together, a quantitative analysis was carried out to ensure inter-rater reliability. The quantitative analysis chosen was similar to the one used for the Miami Corpus (Deuchar, 2011) and which is described in Deuchar et al. (2014). In this case, 15% of all audio recordings were independently transcribed by two of the three researchers. Then, inter-rater reliability was assessed for each transcription file by calculating percent of agreement, which reached an average of 92%. Most discrepancies had to do with the use of CHAT special symbols and not with language issues (e.g., a researcher marked something as a pause whereas another marked it as a hesitation).\\n\\nWhen the transcription process was over, each file was manually checked before starting the annotation process by being proofread by a researcher who did not work on it. This last check was done to make sure there were no spelling or formatting issues that could interfere with the annotation process.\\n\\n5. Data Annotation\\n\\nAll .cha files with the transcriptions were converted into .txt files and were then imported into R (R Core Team, 2021). An R function was created to go over the transcription files and generate a dataframe or table linking the full transcriptions to basic information about the speakers. This was done as a first step to annotate the transcriptions, as dataframes allow us to work with data in a more efficient manner. The dataframe contained 6 columns:\\n\\n- id: a number to identify each row\\n- text: the speaker's transcription as a single paragraph\\n- speaker: a unique code to identify each speaker anonymously\\n- generation: whether the speaker was a first- or second-generation immigrant\\n- gender: whether the speaker was a male or a female\\n- language: the language of the narrative (either English or Spanish)\\n\\nAll this information was extracted from the .txt files, either from the header or the transcription lines. The dataframe was exported as a .csv file.\\n\\nOnce all the transcriptions were conveniently stored in a dataframe, the annotation process began. The .csv file was imported into R and the udpipe R package (Straka et al., 2016; Wijffels, 2021) was loaded. udpipe is an R package designed for doing natural language processing directly in R without having to rely on other programming languages such as Python or Java. It allows tokenization, POS-tagging, lemmatization, and dependency parsing. udpipe uses pre-trained models which are available in many languages and which follow the Universal Dependencies (UD) framework (Nivre et al., 2016), a project that aims to develop consistent treebank annotation for multiple languages.\"}"}

A new R function was created to iterate over each row (i.e., each full transcription) in the main dataframe and annotate the text using the appropriate language model. This generated a new, larger dataframe with one word per row.\\n\\nThis dataframe contained 10 columns:\\n\\n- **id**: a number to identify each row\\n- **sentence**: individual sentences from the transcriptions\\n- **token_id**: a number to identify each token in a transcription\\n- **token**: each token\\n- **lemma**: lemma corresponding to each token\\n- **upos**: POS-tag for each token based on the UD framework\\n- **speaker**: a unique code to identify each speaker anonymously\\n- **generation**: whether the speaker was a first- or second-generation immigrant\\n- **gender**: whether the speaker was a male or a female\\n- **language**: the language of the narrative (either English or Spanish)\\n\\nThis dataframe containing the annotations was also exported as a .csv file. Since the process of annotation was automatically done relying on the udpipe package and the pre-trained models, the .csv file was manually checked by three researchers to ensure all the information was correct. These were the same researchers that had previously worked on the transcription process. For this manual check, a set of guidelines was created describing how to deal with some of the most common issues found in the annotated dataframe (e.g., how to annotate passages with code-switching, how to annotate CHAT special transcription symbols).\\n\\nAll researchers followed the guidelines to ensure the annotations were consistent and reliable, and any discrepancies were discussed as a group. This revised dataset constitutes the basis for the user interface that was developed to explore the corpus.\\n\\n### 6. User Interface\\n\\nThe user interface developed for the BILinMID Corpus was built as an R-Shiny app using the shinyR package (Chang et al., 2021). R-Shiny apps are interactive web applications that can be built directly in R and which can be further customized with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. More specifically, these apps are useful to interact with data in tabular format. Since the datasets (i.e., the .csv files) followed that format, developing an R-Shiny app was a good option.\\n\\nThe user interface developed for the BILinMID Corpus is simple and intuitive. It has a horizontal navigation bar at the top with several tabs, as follows:\\n\\n- **Home**: the BILinMID Corpus homepage\\n- **About this corpus**: a general description about the corpus and the research team\\n- **How to use this corpus**: information about what users can find in the different tabs\\n- **The speakers**: information about the speakers based on responses from the Qualtrics questionnaire\\n- **Search by KWIC**: to search for a specific keyword in the corpus\\n- **Search by lemma**: to search for a specific lemma in the corpus\\n- **Search full transcriptions**: to search for a transcription given a speaker and a language\\n\\nTo navigate the app, users simply have to click on a tab and they will be taken to that page. Important for our purposes are the four last tabs. The \u2018the speakers\u2019 page displays a table through the DT R package (Xie et al., 2021), which is an R interface for the JavaScript library DataTables. The table displayed on the app comes from the .csv file containing the information about the speakers\u2019 background and demographics (e.g., gender, age, generation, BLP score) (Figure 3). Thus, this table provides the relevant meta-data for the BILinMID Corpus.\\n\\nThe pages \u2018search by KWIC\u2019 and \u2018search by lemma\u2019 are very similar to one another and provide an easy way to query the corpus. These pages contain a browser on the left together with filters for language, generation, and gender. Users can type in a word (either a keyword or a lemma) and adjust the filters, and a JavaScript table will appear on the right of the page containing any sentences from the corpus that match the query. The table will also list the speaker who produced the sentence. The dataset searched for during these queries is the annotated .csv dataframe that was created with udpipe. When the user executes a query, the keyword or lemma is found in the dataframe and the sentences containing the match are selected together with their speakers (Figure 4).\\n\\nLastly, the \u2018search full transcriptions\u2019 page has a language filter and a speaker filter on the left. Here, users will see the full transcription of the speaker and language they choose (Figure 5). This transcription can be copied and exported elsewhere for further analysis.\"}"}

The corpus contains the transcriptions of short stories narrated by the speakers together with relevant meta-data. The corpus also includes a practical user interface developed with R-Shiny to facilitate exploring the datasets. To my knowledge, this is the first corpus documenting the speech of bilinguals in this region of the US.\\n\\nIn terms of future work, the BILinMID Corpus is still in progress. Therefore, more speakers will be recorded in the near future, especially from the early simultaneous bilingual group and the late second language learner group. The goal is to have roughly the same number of speakers per group (~40-50 speakers). Likewise, the user interface will also be enhanced to support other types of queries and to provide some analytics. Even though this requires more processing of the udpipe output, these new features will make the user interface more functional.\\n\\n8. Acknowledgements\\n\\nI thank A. Andino and A.
