For all parameters and code, see: [https://github.com/mitvis/vistext](https://github.com/mitvis/vistext).\\n\\n**D Implementation Details**\\n\\nCode to train and evaluate our text-based and image-guided models is available at [https://github.com/mitvis/vistext](https://github.com/mitvis/vistext). Table 4 summarizes our model training parameters.\\n\\n**D.1 Text-Based Chart Captioning**\\n\\nTo train our text-based chart captioning models, we use the Huggingface implementation of ByT5 (Wolf et al., 2019). Due to hardware limitations, we use the ByT5-small model, which has 300M parameters. We fine-tune each model for 50 epochs, using Adam optimization with a learning rate of 5e-05. To fit the input features into GPU memory, we truncate the input text (i.e., scene graph or data table) to 1024 tokens and the output caption to 512 tokens. We select the best model epochs based on the validation loss of the validation set. See Table 4 or the VisText GitHub repository [1] for each model's full training details and hyperparameters.\\n\\nWe train each model three times with and without prefix-tuning and report the mean and standard deviation in Table 1. We train each model on four NVidia V100 GPUs with 32GB of memory connected by an NVLink2 network. With prefix-tuning, training, evaluation, and inference took approximately 39 hours for the scene-graph model and 11 hours for the data-table models. Without prefix-tuning, training, evaluation, and inference took approximately 78 hours for the scene-graph model and 22 hours for the data-table models. We estimate that we trained each model between 30 to 45 times to achieve our final results.\\n\\n**D.2 Image-Guided Chart Captioning**\\n\\nOur image-guided chart captioning models extend the VLT5 model (Cho et al., 2021), which is a multimodal extension of T5-base. We extract visual features from VisText's chart images using Bottom-Up Feature Extraction (Anderson et al., 2018) and 36 bounding boxes per image. After feature extraction, we fine-tune VLT5 on the VisText dataset for 50 epochs following the default VLT5 training protocol [2] (Cho et al., 2021). To fit the input features into GPU memory, we truncate the input text (i.e., scene graph or data table) to 1024 tokens and the output caption to 512 tokens. After 50 epochs, we select the epoch with the lowest validation loss as the best model. See Table 4 or the VisText GitHub repository [2] for each model's full training details and hyperparameters.\\n\\nWe train each model three times with and without prefix-tuning and report the mean and standard deviation in Table 1. We train each model on four NVidia V100 GPUs with 1TB of memory. The image models take approximately 2 minutes per training epoch without prefix-tuning and approximately 3 minutes per training epoch with prefix-tuning.\\n\\n---\\n\\n1.

We recruited participants on the Prolific.co crowdsourcing platform, following conventions in the data visualization research community and recent research results (Tang et al., 2022) that suggest Prolific yields higher quality results than Amazon Mechanical Turk. We conducted multiple pilot runs to calibrate the amount of time it would take participants to complete the study, and found that most participants were able to successfully do so within 14 minutes. Following Silberman et al. (2018), who advocate for paying workers at least minimum wage at your location, we choose to pay our participants $3.25 \u2014 a roughly $14/hour rate in line with the $14.25/hour minimum wage in Massachusetts at the time the study was conducted.\\n\\nOur study was determined to be exempt by MIT's institutional review board (IRB). Participants had to explicitly provide their consent in order to proceed with the study \u2014 if participants did not consent, they were redirected back to the Prolific platform. The consent statement (Fig. 8) reminded participants of their rights (including that their participation is voluntary and consent could be revoked at any time), and encouraged participants to contact either the study PI or IRB board directly should they have any concerns. We constrained our participant pool (and eligibility requirements) to people living within the United States or United Kingdom who self-reported as being sighted with no vision or color impairments. We did not collect any additional demographic data from participants as we did not determine this to bias or otherwise affect the content we hoped to collect.\\n\\nEach task (an example of which is shown in Fig. 10) included an attention check where participants were asked to correctly identify the chart type shown. If participants failed more than two attention checks, their submission was flagged for manual review \u2014 in practice, the bulk of participants who failed attention checks nevertheless produced valid captions and, thus, were paid fully. The task asked participants to complete a free response question to describe as completely as they could the trends and patterns observed, emphasizing that their response would be evaluated for correctness and completeness. Despite best practices suggesting a more structured, querying approach (called QID) can yield higher quality captions (Morash et al., 2015), we opted for our free-response approach as the benefits of QID (namely, in expressing the chart type, title, and axes units) would already be captured by our synthetically generated L1 captions. Moreover, in contrast to the templatized output produced by QID, we hoped that our free-response responses would yield more \u201cnatural\u201d articulations of perceptual and cognitive trends, following the Lundgard and Satyanarayan (2022) framework.\\n\\n3https://twitter.com/eagereyes/status/1187773534745088000\"}"}

However, current approaches for automatically generating such captions struggle to articulate the perceptual or cognitive features that are the hallmark of charts (e.g., complex trends and patterns). In response, we introduce VisText: a dataset of 12,441 pairs of charts and captions that describe the charts' construction, report key statistics, and identify perceptual and cognitive phenomena. In VisText, a chart is available as three representations: a rasterized image, a backing data table, and a scene graph\u2014a hierarchical representation of a chart's visual elements akin to a web page's Document Object Model (DOM).\\n\\nTo evaluate the impact of VisText, we fine-tune state-of-the-art language models on our chart captioning task and apply prefix-tuning to produce captions that vary the semantic content they convey. Our models generate coherent, semantically rich captions and perform on par with state-of-the-art chart captioning models across machine translation and text generation metrics. Through qualitative analysis, we identify six broad categories of errors that our models make that can inform future work.\\n\\n1 Introduction\\nStudies have shown that captions can improve the recall and comprehension of the data that charts depict (Hegarty and Just, 1993; Large et al., 1995). For instance, when a caption emphasizes visually prominent features of a chart, like a peak or a sharply declining trend, readers treat this information as the key takeaway (Kim et al., 2021). Moreover, for people with visual disabilities, captions (or equivalent descriptions such as alt text) are often the only means of accessing the presented data. However, as evidenced by numerous guidelines (Jung et al., 2021), producing high-quality chart captions is a non-trivial and laborious manual process. Thus, despite these advantages, charts are only rarely captioned in practice (Lundgard and Satyanarayan, 2022).\\n\\nTo bridge this gap, several research communities have begun to explore methods for automatically generating chart captions, including using templates and heuristics (Demir et al., 2008; Srinivasan et al., 2019), adapting image captioning techniques (Balaji et al., 2018; Chen et al., 2019a), or via data-to-text machine translation (Kantharaj et al., 2022; Obeid and Hoque, 2020). While promising, these approaches have largely produced captions that either describe a chart's construction (e.g., \\\"The graph is plot between 'Number of people' x-axis over 'Movie Genres' y-axis\\\" (Balaji et al., 2018)) or provide statistical summaries (e.g., \\\"Machinery and equipment was the most valuable commodity for Singapore in 2019\\\" (Kantharaj et al., 2022)). However, these captions do not articulate the perceptual and cognitive features that make charts a distinctive and compelling medium for communicating data (e.g., \\\"Prices of Big Tech corporations seem to fluctuate but nevertheless increase over time\\\" (Lundgard and Satyanarayan, 2022)). Indeed, as Lundgard and Satyanarayan (2022) find, both sighted and blind readers strongly prefer captions that express this type of content.\\n\\nTo automatically produce such semantically richer captions, we introduce VisText: a benchmark dataset of 12,441 pairs of charts and captions.\\n\\nVisText makes two key extensions over prior approaches. First, VisText offers three representations of charts: a rasterized image and backing data table, as in previous work; and a scene graph, a hierarchical representation akin to a web page's Document Object Model (DOM), that presents an attractive midpoint between the affordances of chart-as-image and chart-as-data-table. Second, for each chart, VisText provides a synthetically generated caption detailing its construction as well as\"}"}

These crowdsourced captions represent a substantial increase in data over prior comparable datasets (Mahinpei et al., 2022; Kantharaj et al., 2022).\\n\\nTo demonstrate the possible uses of the VisText dataset, we train three classes of models \u2014 text-based caption models, image-guided captioning models, and semantic prefix-tuning. Text-based captioning models fine-tune large language models for VisText's chart captioning task, revealing that both data table and scene graph representations can produce compelling and semantically rich captions.\\n\\nFollowing recent advancements in image-guided translation (Sulubacak et al., 2020), we leverage the additional visual affordances in chart images to develop image-guided chart captioning models. Finally, since users often have varying preferences about the type of semantic content in their captions (Lundgard and Satyanarayan, 2022), we apply semantic prefix-tuning to each of our models, enabling them to output customizable captions.\\n\\nOur models generate coherent, semantically rich captions across the VisText charts. Evaluating against standard machine translation and text generation metrics reveals that our models consistently output captions that accurately describe the chart's construction, such as its chart type, title, and axis ranges. Through qualitative analysis of our model's captions, we find that our model competently outputs semantically rich captions that describe data trends and complex patterns. Further, we categorize six common captioning errors that can inform the future development of chart captioning models on the VisText dataset.\\n\\nThe VisText dataset and source code are available at: https://github.com/mitvis/vistext.\\n\\n2 Related work\\n\\nHeuristic-Based Chart Captioning. Automatically generating natural language descriptions of data tables dates back to Reiter and Dale (1997). Demir et al. (2008, 2010, 2012) survey this early work and describe the process of extracting insights from a chart by evaluating a list of propositions and composing selected propositions together to produce a natural language summary. More recently, data visualization researchers have explored heuristics that calculate summary statistics and templates to assemble natural language \\\"data facts\\\" (Srinivasan et al., 2019) or descriptions (Cui et al., 2019). While useful, these approaches yield standardized descriptions that lack the variation and linguistic construction that characterize semantically rich captions (Lundgard and Satyanarayan, 2022).\\n\\nChart Captioning as Image Captioning. With rapid advances of neural image captioning (Vinyals et al., 2015; Anderson et al., 2018), researchers have begun to adapt these methods for captioning charts. For instance, Balaji et al. (2018) develop a deep learning pipeline that ingests a PNG chart image, classifies the chart type, detects and classifies textual content present in the chart, and uses this information to generate a textual description. Chen et al. (2019a,b, 2020) propose a simpler workflow using ResNet to encode the chart image and an LSTM with Attention to decode it into a natural language description. Both approaches share a pair of limitations. The captions they produce convey relatively simplistic information about the chart (e.g., title, axis labels, etc.) or articulate concepts in visual rather than data terms (e.g., \\\"Dark Magenta has the lowest value\\\"). While both approaches contribute associated datasets, their charts and captions are synthetically generated and may not represent real-world counterparts. SciCap (Hsu et al., 2021) addresses this limitation by scraping real-world charts from 290,000 arXiv papers; however, the baseline models trained on this dataset struggle to generate semantically rich captions.\\n\\nChart Captioning as Text Translation. Perhaps closest to our contribution is recent work modeling chart captioning as a data-to-text problem. For instance, Spreafico and Carenini (2020) train an encoder-decoder LSTM architecture to generate a natural language caption from time series data. Similarly, Obeid and Hoque (2020) and Kantharaj et al. (2022) explore how transformer architectures can translate tabular structures into captions. These data-to-text methods are more successful than chart-as-image captioning, yielding captions that better capture relevant information from the charts and have higher BLEU scores. Nevertheless, we observe two limitations with these data-to-text approaches that motivate our contribution. First, data-to-text methods are heavily reliant on access to a chart's data table. In practice, data tables are only rarely published alongside charts and methods that recover equivalent information via OCR experience a significant drop in performance (Kantharaj et al., 2022). Second, the associated datasets...\"}"}
{"id": "acl-2023-long-401", "page_num": 3, "content": "{\"primary_language\":\"en\",\"is_rotation_valid\":true,\"rotation_correction\":0,\"is_table\":false,\"is_diagram\":false,\"natural_text\":\"do not contain sufficient training examples of captions that express semantically rich insights about the depicted data (i.e., the perceptual and cognitive phenomena that distinguish charts as a medium as distinct from data tables (Lundgard and Satyanarayan, 2022)). As a result, while the generated captions are compelling, they are largely limited to reporting statistics which sighted and blind readers prefer less than captions that convey complex trends and patterns (Lundgard and Satyanarayan, 2022).\\n\\n3. The VisText Dataset\\n\\nWe designed the VisText dataset in response to two limitations existing datasets present for generating semantically rich chart captions. First, existing datasets represent charts as either rasterized images or as data tables. While useful, these representations trade off perceptual fidelity and chart semantics in mutually exclusive ways \u2014 images capture the perceptual and cognitive phenomena that are distinctive to charts (e.g., trends or outliers) but pixels cannot express the rich semantic relationships between chart elements (e.g., estimating plotted data values using axis labels). While the vice-versa is true (Lundgard and Satyanarayan, 2022), tables also present additional caveats. There is not always a one-to-one relationship between the semantics of a data table and chart (i.e., one data table may be the source for several distinctly different charts). Moreover, data tables are rarely published alongside charts; and, automatic data table extraction is error-prone due to the diversity of chart types and visual styles as well as the difficulty of reasoning about visual occlusion (Kantharaj et al., 2022; Luo et al., 2021; Jung et al., 2017)).\\n\\nSecond, if existing datasets provide captions that describe perceptual or cognitive features, these captions comprise only a small portion of the dataset. At best, LineCap (Mahinpei et al., 2022) offers 3,528 such captions for line charts only, while Chart-to-Text (Kantharaj et al., 2022) estimates that roughly 15% of the sentences in its captions across a variety of chart types express such content. In contrast, VisText provides 12,441 crowdsourced English captions that articulate statistical, perceptual, and cognitive characteristics of bar, line, and area charts. In VisText, charts are available as not only data tables and rasterized images but also as scene graphs. Scene graphs are hierarchical representations that better preserve perceptual fidelity and chart semantics, are often the format for publishing web-based charts, and can be recovered from chart images (Poco and Heer, 2017).\\n\\n3.1 Data Table Collection\\n\\nThe data tables found in VisText are sourced from the Statista dataset of the Chart-to-Text benchmark (Kantharaj et al., 2022). The tables were collected by crawling Statista.com in December 2020 and contain real-world data related to technology, trade, retail, and sports. We process these tables to make them amenable for chart generation, including stripping formatting symbols (e.g., $ and %), standardizing data strings, and identifying the measure type of each column (i.e., quantitative, categorical, or temporal). Data tables are discarded if they do not contain at least one quantitative field and one categorical or temporal field, or if other errors occur during the processing steps. We further down select to data tables containing between 2 to 20 columns and 10 to 500 rows. If a data table has over 500 rows, we randomly sample rows. In larger data tables, this step potentially affects how salient a trend is.\\n\\n3.2 Chart Generation and Representation\\n\\nCharts in the Chart-to-Text Statista dataset all feature the same layout and visual appearance. In contrast, we aim for richer visual diversity by generating charts using the Vega-Lite visualization library (Satyanarayan et al., 2016) via the Python Altair package (VanderPlas et al., 2018). To facilitate collecting high-quality captions, we focus on univariate charts: charts that depict one quantitative observation against a categorical or temporal variable. This focus is informed by recent work in the data visualization research community which has chosen single-series line charts as the target of study for natural language descriptions (Kim et al., 2021; Stokes et al., 2022). VisText also includes single-series bar and area charts as they typically exhibit similar perceptual features to line charts. For each data table, we iterate through pairs of univariate fields. If the pair contains a temporal field, we randomly generate an area or line chart; if the pair contains a categorical field, we randomly generate a horizontal or vertical bar chart. For diversity in layout and visual appearance, we randomly rotate axis labels and apply one of fourteen themes provided by the Vega-Lite library. These themes mimic the visual style of common chart platforms or publishers (e.g., ggplot2 or the LA Times).\"}"}

Templates and synonym replacements are listed in Appendix E.2.\\n\\nTo crowdsource L2 and L3 content, we extend the protocol used by Lundgard and Satyanarayan (2022). After soliciting consent, we introduce the task: participants are presented with a chart image and corresponding L1 description; they are asked to write a description about the trends and patterns they observe without drawing on background knowledge or repeating L1 information. The introduction provides examples and explanations of valid and invalid responses. After acknowledging these examples, participants are asked to complete 5 random iterations of the task. To maximize the quality of our crowdsourced captions, we manually curated the charts and L1 descriptions used in the study. We discarded any charts that were challenging to read (e.g., colors were too similar, marks were not easily readable, etc.). Participants were recruited on the Prolific.co platform, took approximately 14 minutes to complete the study, and were compensated $3.25 ($14/hour). Additional details on our crowdsourcing process are in Appendix E.3.\\n\\nWe manually verified charts where participants failed an attention check and discarded invalid descriptions. Additionally, we manually inspected captions for personally identifiable information or offensive content. Using heuristics, we removed captions where respondents described charts as unclear or illegible and replaced newline characters with spaces. Although we attempted to fix incorrect spelling and casing errors using a similar heuristic-based approach, we observed that this process could improperly affect axis and chart names. As a result, these errors remain in our dataset.\\n\\n3.4 Dataset Analysis\\n\\nFigure 2 shows the distribution and means of the lengths of chart representations and captions. Synthetically generated L1 captions have roughly 1.5x more characters than crowdsourced L2/L3 captions ($\\\\mu = 255$ vs. $\\\\mu = 177$) but the average number of sentences are comparable (2.5 vs. 2). The VisText dataset consists of captions for 3,189 area charts, 6,238 bar charts, and 3,014 line charts \u2014 the roughly twice-as-many bar charts as area or line charts corresponds to the randomization of temporal fields during chart generation (Sec. 3.2). As some charts have multiple crowdsourced captions, we randomly split our dataset into training, validation, and test sets using the chart IDs to prevent data leakage across sets. This resulted in an approximate ratio of 80:10:10.\\n\\nFinally, to understand the distribution of semantic content, we manually coded 2% (230) of crowdsourced captions. We followed a protocol inspired by Lundgard and Satyanarayan (2022) by breaking sentences down into independent statements and mapping these statements to their semantic content level. We marked statements as not categorizable if they did not map to the framework \u2014 for instance, if captions expressed commentary from crowd workers such as \u201cthis chart is hard to read.\u201d Our analysis revealed 11 L1 statements (2.4%), 180 L2 statements (39.7%), 253 L3 statements (55.7%), and 10 not categorizable statements (2.2%). While a handful express L1 content, the bulk of statements (95%) express L2 or L3 content, with approximately 1.4x L3 statements than L2.\\n\\n4 Chart Captioning Models\\n\\nTo demonstrate the affordances of the VisText dataset, we train three classes of models. First, we fine-tune large language models to translate from textual chart representations to natural language.\"}"}

In particular, Kantharaj et al. found that models that translate data tables to chart captions significantly outperform image captioning models. However, when data tables were not available, the authors found a significant drop in their models' ability to extract relevant information from the chart \u2014 an effect that was only slightly ameliorated by using OCR methods to extract text from chart images. In contrast, VisText\u2019s scene graphs can be more readily recovered from charts when data tables are not available \u2014 for instance, by processing the SVG format of web-based visualizations. Moreover, scene graphs offer a potentially richer source of information than data tables as they encode visual properties of the chart (e.g., coordinates and colors) and are less noisy than tokens recovered via OCR. Thus, to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of scene graphs, we train a scene-graph text translation model and a baseline data-table model for comparison.\\n\\nFor each model, we fine-tune a pretrained ByT5 transformer model (Xue et al., 2022) on the VisText dataset. We choose ByT5 over T5 transformers (Raffel et al., 2020) because it uses a token-free, byte-encoding that eliminates the use of a tokenizer. As a result, it is robust to noisy inputs, minimizes the need for text preprocessing, and eliminates the out-of-dictionary problem. This allows our model to handle common typographical and chart reading errors in the crowdsourced L2 and L3 captions and increases generalizability to previously-unseen words that could be present in chart and axes titles.\\n\\n4.2 Image-Guided Chart Captioning\\n\\nFollowing recent advancements in image-guided machine translation (Sulubacak et al., 2020), we train image-guided captioning models using the VisText dataset. Images have improved text-based machine translation models by providing visual information complementary to natural language inputs. Similarly, chart images can contain visuals complementary to the textual specification. For instance, visual affordances that are important for perceiving a trend (e.g., gestalt relations, relative sizes/areas, etc.) may be obfuscated in the scene graph but better captured in the chart image.\\n\\nWe train three image-guided chart captioning models: image, image-scene-graph, and image-data-table. All models leverage the vision-language transformer model VL-T5 (Cho et al., 2021). VL-T5 is pretrained on image captioning and visual grounding tasks and was successfully applied to machine translation, making it suitable for chart captioning. We extract visual features for each VisText chart image using a Bottom-Up Feature Extractor (Anderson et al., 2018). To explore the value of images to chart captioning, our image model only takes in the image features, while image-scene-graph and image-data-table concatenate the image features with the chart\u2019s textual representations (scene graph or data table).\\n\\n4.3 Semantic Prefix-Tuning\\n\\nIn real-world chart captioning settings, users want to vary the level of semantic content in their captions. For instance, while some blind users want verbose captions that describe the chart visuals, sighted users may only want captions that help them expose data trends (Lundgard and Satyanarayan, 2022). To develop models capable of such customization, we leverage prefix-tuning strategies alongside VisText\u2019s semantic caption breakdown. Prefix-tuning specifies a task alongside the input, permitting a single large language model to perform many different tasks. In our setting, we use prefix-tuning to specify the level of semantic content to include in the caption (Li and Liang, 2021).\\n\\nWe train each of our models with and without semantic prefix-tuning. With semantic prefix-tuning, we treat chart captioning as a multi-task fine-tuning problem, where the model is trained to generate the L1 and L2/L3 captions separately. In every epoch, the model sees each VisText chart twice, once with\"}"}

We also qualitatively analyze the descriptiveness of generated L2/L3 captions and categorize common errors.\\n\\n5.1 Quantitative Model Performance\\n\\nWe evaluate the results of our text-based and image-guided captioning models with and without prefix-tuning. We also compare to a current state-of-the-art chart captioning model that uses data table chart representations and a T5 generation model (Kantharaj et al., 2022). To measure the quality of output captions, we evaluate each model on machine translation and language generation metrics (Table 1).\\n\\nChart images do not support captioning. The image model performs the worst of all the chart captioning models. Its low perplexity and high error rates indicate it is highly confident in its inaccurate captions. While chart images contain the same information encoded in the chart's textual representations, it is presumably not adequately extracted by the model. Both the image model backbone (Cho et al., 2021) and the visual feature extractor (Anderson et al., 2018) are trained on natural images, making chart images out-of-distribution inputs that are likely to be poorly represented by these vision models. As the chart captioning task grows, model backbones, architectures, and feature extractors could be customized to chart images, which may improve image-based chart captioning.\\n\\nAll models produce high quality L1 captions. In our chart captioning setting, relation generation (Wiseman et al., 2017) measures how often the chart title, axis names, and axis scales in the input appear in the caption. Every model (except image) achieves a similarly-high relation generation score, indicating that every model can generate detailed L1 captions.\\n\\nScene graphs perform as well as data tables. Models trained on scene graph representations achieve similar performance across the evaluative metrics to models trained on data tables. As scene graphs can be more easily extracted from web-based charts images, they may be the preferred representation for future chart captioning models.\\n\\nImage-guiding does not improve captioning. Our image-guided captioning models do not experience the significant increase in performance other image-guided translation tasks report. While in image-guided translation, images contain substantial additional information beyond the text, the image and textual representations in chart captioning often contain highly similar information. The small amount of additional information in images might benefit complex captioning tasks on multivariate charts or infographics; however, the current VisText captions rarely reference visual information not present in the scene graph or data table.\\n\\nPrefix-tuning is free. Adding semantic prefix-tuning to our models does not significantly change their performance. Models trained with and without prefix-tuning are exposed to the same set of charts, so it is consistent that prefix-tuning would not impact the quality of output captions. Given prefix-tuned models are able to output L1, L2/L3, and L1+L2/L3 captions, prefix-tuning may be preferred if users require semantic customization.\\n\\n5.2 Qualitative Caption Evaluation\\n\\nTo augment our quantitative evaluation, we qualitatively assess the descriptiveness and accuracy of the generated chart captions. Since L1 caption accuracy can be measured at scale via relation generation, we focus our evaluation on L2/L3 predictions. Prior analysis tasked annotators with comparing the accuracy, coherence, and fluency of generated captions compared to a target caption (Kantharaj et al., 2022). Instead, our approach follows an inductive qualitative data analysis approach: iteratively analyzing captions in a \u201cbottom-up\u201d fashion to identify emergent patterns in how generated captions compare to the ground truth (Bingham and Witkowsky, 2021). We randomly sample 176 generated captions from the scene-graph model with prefix-tuning and break them into their independent L2 and L3 statements, resulting in 181 (48.27%) L2 statements and 194 (51.73%) L3 statements.\\n\\nApproximately half (241 / 512) of the L2 and L3 statements made in the generated captions are factually accurate. Moreover, many of the full sentences are written in a natural, human-like manner and generated captions frequently include both compound and complex sentences. On average, every generated caption has one L3 statement and zero to\"}"}

The VisText charts are represented as a rasterized image, data table, and scene graph to provide diverse and complementary data modalities. Using VisText, we fine-tune large language models to generate natural language captions from textual chart representations and integrate image-guided chart captioning to leverage multimodal information. Utilizing the varied semantic content in VisText captions, we develop semantic prefix-tuned models that output semantically customized captions to meet diverse user needs. Evaluations reveal that our models output precise and semantically descriptive captions, performing on par with state-of-the-art chart captioning models (Kantharaj et al., 2022) across machine translation and text generation metrics.\\n\\nLooking ahead, while accessibility remains a key domain that would benefit from automated chart captioning, and deploying automated chart captioning models into the field is an exciting prospect, we believe the most promising approach for future work lies in \u201cmixed-initiative\u201d (i.e., human + AI) chart authoring systems. In particular, as we describe in our Ethics Statement below, chart captioning models are currently prone to make a number of factual inaccuracies which can have severe harmful consequences. On the other hand, by integrating these models into chart authoring systems (e.g., Tableau, Charticulator, Data Illustrator, or Lyra), chart authors can intervene and make any necessary corrections. Indeed, such integration offers exciting opportunities to develop novel interactive methods for verifying generated captions. For instance, models like ours could generate an initial caption (or set of captions) based on the chart currently being authored; as the system has access to all three representations of the chart (the backing data table, chart image, and structured scene graph), it might automatically segment the caption into independent \u201cdata segments\u201d and interactively link and map them to rows in the table or regions on the chart, akin to Kori (Latif et al., 2021).\"}"}

Future work can now begin to consider more complex chart forms in a step-by-step manner. For instance, moving from univariate bar, area, and line charts to multivariate versions of these chart types (i.e., stacked bars and areas, grouped bars, and multi-series line charts). From there, work can also consider chart types that surface perceptual and cognitive phenomena in visually distinct ways (e.g., scatterplots, where trends appear as clusters of points; heatmaps, where color saturation often encodes a trend; or maps, where color or other layered elements such as symbols are used to represent data values). Finally, automated methods for captioning visualizations may eschew chart typologies altogether in favor of visualization grammars \u2014 by offering a more composable and combinatorial approach to the design space (Wilkinson, 2012), learning over visualization grammars may offer a more robust approach to captioning highly customized or unique visual forms.\\n\\nFor each future work direction, we anticipate scene graph representations to prove more fruitful than the data table. As the complexity of the visualization increases, its relationship to the data table only grows more ambiguous; the scene graph, on the other hand, directly encodes the visual form and thus remains faithful to it. As a result, to support such future work, VisText provides the raw specifications used to produce our charts (via the Vega-Lite visualization grammar (Satyanarayan et al., 2016)) as well as the raw, hierarchical scene graphs prior to our linearization and reduction step.\\n\\nEthics Statement\\n\\nThe Consequences of Incorrect Captions.\\n\\nWei\u0119dinger et al. (2021) comprehensively survey the risks associated with the large language models (LLMs) that underlie our contribution. Of the six categories of risk they identify, harms stemming from models producing factually incorrect statements are not only most pertinent to our work, but are likely heighted as compared to general uses of LLMs given the context we are addressing: automatically captioning charts. In particular, people most often consume charts and visualizations in order to make data-driven decisions (Keim et al., 2008) \u2014 for instance, about whether to evacuate ahead of a hurricane (Padilla et al., 2018), or health & safety during the pandemic (Shneiderman, 2020). Moreover, recent results have shown that readers not only fixate for longer and are more likely to recall the textual content of and around visualizations (Borkin et al., 2015) but this textual content can strongly influence the takeaway message readers leave with even when it is at odds with the depicted data (Kong et al., 2018, 2019). Finally, these issues are exacerbated by the persuasive and rhetorical force of data and charts (Kennedy et al., 2016; Hullman and Diakopoulos, 2011), that often project a sense of authority and certainty (Correll, 2019). As a result, readers may not think to double check the accuracy of chart captions, and inaccurate statements that models may produce could lead to harmful downstream decisions.\\n\\nTo proceed ethically with this line of research, we believe that advances in data and modeling need to be closely followed by attention devoted to mitigating the risks of incorrect statements. At base, automatically generated captions should be identified as such at the forefront to raise readers' awareness about the potential for incorrect statements. And, interactive visual linking strategies (such as those explored by Kong and Agrawala (2012); Kim et al. (2018)) could be deployed to help readers manually verify the constituent statements of a caption against the chart. These strategies, however, place the burden of harm mitigation on readers. Thus, an alternate approach might never surface automatically generated captions to readers directly but instead use them as part of mixed-initiative systems for jointly authoring visualization and text, such as Kori (Latif et al., 2021). In such systems, automated chart captioning models would help to accelerate the authoring process \u2014 combatting the blank slate problem by providing an initial summary of the chart \u2014 and chart authors would make any necessary corrections prior to publication.\\n\\nBesides these human-computer interaction (HCI) approaches for mitigating harm, an equally important direction for future work should leverage interpretability techniques to more deeply study what the models are learning. To what degree are chart captioning models stochastic parrots (Bender et al., 2021), and how much do they understand the information charts depict?\\n\\nAutomated Captioning for Accessibility.\\n\\nAlthough accessibility is a guiding motivation for the bulk of work in automated captioning (be it image captioning or, as in our case, chart captioning), studies find mixed reactions, at best, about these approaches among people with disabilities (PWDs).\"}"}

This disconnect appears to stem from a more fundamental mismatch between what PWDs describe as their captioning needs, and what the research community \u2014 particularly through its automatic, quantitative evaluations \u2014 prioritizes (Jandrey et al., 2021). In particular, surveys with PWDs repeatedly surface the contextual nature of captions. Bennett et al. (2021) find that the context of use shapes the degree to which PWD are comfortable with captions describing people's race, gender, and disabilities \u2014 for instance, changing their preferences if they were in a white, cisgender, nondisabled, and professional company versus their own community. Similarly, Jung et al. (2022) find shifting preferences for the content image descriptions should convey across different photo activities \u2014 for example, when viewing or taking photos, participants wished for descriptions that conveyed spatial cues whereas when searching or reminiscing about photos, participants hoped for descriptions to connect to personal data or differentiating details.\\n\\nIn contrast, quantitative metrics of model performance compare generated captions to a single \\\"ground truth\\\" caption. This framing of success not only makes it difficult to develop contextually-varying caption generation but can actively penalize such investigations. For instance, with our work, we explored how prefix-tuning can be used to develop models that are responsive to users' preferences about semantic content. However, as described in Sec. 5.1, existing quantitative metrics of model performance (e.g., BLEU, ROUGE, WMD, and TER) show a drop in model performance despite our qualitative analysis indicating that these captions are indeed high quality.\\n\\nFinally, our exploration of semantic prefix-tuning represents only a very preliminary step towards addressing the contextual captioning needs of PWDs. In particular, the semantic labels VisText assigns to captions were derived from prior work (Lundgard and Satyanarayan, 2022) that only explored natural language descriptions when consuming presentations of visualizations \u2014 one task from a broader palette (Brehmer and Munzner, 2013). Future work might instead extend the VisText dataset \u2014 and corresponding models \u2014 to consider captions for a broader range of tasks including consuming visualizations for scientific discovery, enjoyment or, producing, searching, or querying visualizations (Brehmer and Munzner, 2013).\\n\\nAcknowledgements\\nWe thank Nicol\u00e1s Kennedy and Alan Lundgard for their work developing an initial version of our crowdsourced study protocol.
