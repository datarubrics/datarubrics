Subsets of this collection have been used in shared tasks (e.g. Multilingual Semantic Search, Machine Translation) aimed at accelerating the creation of resources and tools needed to facilitate access to Information in the COVID-19 emergency situation.\\n\\nKeywords:\\nCOVID-19, Parallel Corpus, Machine Translation, Emergency Situations\\n\\n1. Introduction\\n\\nIn December 2019, the first cases of the COVID-19 disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus were identified in Wuhan, Hubei, China. On 11 March 2020, the WHO (World Health Organization) declared the novel coronavirus outbreak a pandemic and it was only a matter of time before every country in the world would be affected by it to a smaller or larger extent. The COVID-19 pandemic, however, unfolded as something more than a disease; it became the catalyst of\u2014quite simultaneous\u2014global changes in everyday life and public discourse with a tremendous impact on financial stability, healthcare systems, national policies, working conditions, individual freedoms, travel and movement.\\n\\nDue to the pandemic, we became increasingly dependent on mass media, social media, news websites, online communication services and in general, anything that involved internet and the \\\"digital\\\". Thus, an abundance of COVID-19 related textual information was generated in many languages and platforms, and motivated researchers to gather and structure data in order to facilitate the use of statistical methods and Artificial Intelligence (AI) for a plethora of applications (Shuja et al., 2020). The emergence of multidisciplinary initiatives, such as the creation of the CORD-19 (Covid-19 Open Research Dataset) dataset1 and the shared tasks built around it, illustrated how data scientists, biomedical experts and policy makers can connect and cooperate in the battle against COVID-19 (Wang et al., 2020).\\n\\nIn emergency situations, Machine Translation (MT) can be embedded in a rapid-response infrastructure and accelerate the speed in which relief can be provided (Lewis et al., 2011). The COVID-19 pandemic is such an emergency situation, albeit with different characteristics compared to other crises due to its global character and extended duration. Access to guidelines, news, announcements, high-quality articles etc. is vital to a wide range of stakeholders, from healthcare professionals, decision-makers and researchers to vulnerable groups, such as immigrants, marginalized communities and the oldest parts of the population. Therefore, MT plays a crucial role in information dissemination and triage, as well as fact-checking, especially if we take into account the existence of the \\\"infodemic\\\"2, i.e. the unprecedented scale of misinformation campaigns, \\\"fake news\\\" and conspiracy theories (propagated even by public figures) during the pandemic.\\n\\nThis paper discusses a use case of exploiting the outcomes of an available infrastructure, namely MediSys (Medical Information System), with the purpose of constructing parallel corpora beneficial for MT. It could be seen as an application of simulating a quick response of the MT community to the pandemic crisis. MediSys is one of the publicly accessible systems of the Europe Media Monitor (EMM) which processes media to identify potential public health threats in a fully automated fashion (Linge et al., 2010). A dataset of metadata which concerns COVID-19 related news was made publicly available and contains millions of news articles stored in RSS/XML format (Jacquet et al., 2020). We parsed these metadata to extract URLs and created monolingual news corpora by harvesting them. Considering these corpora comparable, since they are focused on COVID-19 and were based on news articles which were published during the same period, we processed them with the purpose of identifying parallel segments and building corpora suitable for training and adapting MT systems.\\n\\nIt is worth mentioning that some of the constructed corpora have already been used (alongside other sources) at the COVID-19 MLIA-Eval3, an initiative focused on COVID-19 related multilingual information access with specific evaluation tasks open to participants. In particular, the monolingual corpora were used for the Multilingual Semantic Search task while the parallel corpora became available for the MT task. More information on this task can be found in Casacuberta et al. (2021).\"}"}

Related Work\\n\\nAlthough there is a plethora of grand-scale multilingual corpora that can be utilized in Machine Translation systems, the pandemic ignited interest in the rapid translation of COVID-19 related information and, subsequently, various corpora, benchmarks, initiatives and expert translation systems emerged.\\n\\nTICO-19 (Translation Initiative for COVID-19) is a large collaborative project which has published validation and test sets and resources related to COVID-19 in several languages that act as a benchmark for Machine Translation systems (Anastasopoulos, 2020). For instance, the ParaCrawl project released a synthesized data corpus focused on the COVID-19 domain, which utilizes parallel sentences from available parallel corpora in combination with a COVID-19 glossary sourced from TICO-19. TAUS launched the Corona Crisis Corpus project as a collective industry charity effort, which made available parallel data related to virology, epidemic, medicine, and healthcare. SYSTRAN contributed to this initiative by producing Corona Crisis Translation Models.\\n\\nThe 4th LoResMT (technologies for machine translation of low resource languages) workshop introduced a shared task focused on texts and sign language specifically related to COVID-19 (Ojha et al., 2021). The datasets provided by the organizers have been mainly gathered from governmental sources and news sites, as well as press conferences for the COVID-19 response. Similarly, the 1st round of the COVID-19 MLIA-Eval initiative provided an updated version of EMEA corpus and web-acquired data from websites of national authorities and public health agencies, EU agencies and specific broadcast portals.\\n\\nThere are also several applications that aim at constructing or adapting Machine Translation systems for the accurate translation of COVID-19 related texts. For example, in Way et al. (2020), eight Neural Machine Translation (NMT) systems (for high-resource language pairs) were developed with the use of relevant datasets, such as the TAUS Corona Crisis corpus and the OPUS EMEA corpus.\\n\\nOther approaches include Mahdieh et al. (2020), where the authors report significant quality improvements by adapting an existing NMT system using monolingual in-domain data (e.g. English data related to COVID-19) as well as the one in Bandyopadhyay (2020), where the focus lies on translating five low resource language pairs using factored NMT (i.e. NMT with additional linguistic features in the English side of the sentence pairs).\\n\\n3. Methodology\\n\\nIn this section we describe the method that we used, which includes fetching news articles, merging them into monolingual corpora, mining parallel sentences and applying filtering techniques to construct parallel corpora in 26 language pairs.\\n\\nThe first step of our pipeline was to parse the MediSys metadata. Originally, the MediSys dataset comprised of automatically extracted metadata (e.g. URL, title, language, identified named entities, etc.) from news articles related to COVID-19. However, we only utilized the language and URL of each entry; in particular, we selected datasets spanning across 10 months (December 2019 to September 2020) and located the articles of several languages summing up to about 57 million URLs. Their distribution according to the targeted languages is illustrated in Figure 1. Most of the articles were in English, Spanish, Italian and Arabic (in descending order).\\n\\nThe web pages were fetched as HTMLs using the GNU Wget package, and the boilerplate (e.g., advertisements, disclaimers, etc.) was removed to keep the main content of each webpage in plain text format by using the Cleaner module of the ILSP-FC toolkit. During data acquisition, we noticed that about 12% of the requested web pages were not fetched as the links were already deleted or moved. MediSys categorizes the metadata into groups according to the publication date of the news articles i.e., in a month or two-month period. We adopted the same approach and grouped the resulting text files accordingly, e.g., batch of files for March or for April to May, etc. We merged the text files to create a single document for each language and each period, e.g. English news of March, Greek news of March, \u2026, English news of April and May, Greek news of April, etc. These documents are the initial versions of the COVID-19 related monolingual corpora and could be considered comparable (in pairs), due to their narrow topic and the fact that they were published in the same time period. Especially during this universal emergency, many news articles which were published on popular broadcast portals, were also promptly republished on several portals in their native/local language. This motivated us to mine these corpora (i.e. pairs of comparable documents) for parallel segments.\\n\\nTo this end, each language-period document was split into sentences by using in-house tools based on the NLTK library (Bird et al., 2009), duplicates were detected and removed, and language identification was applied. In total, approximately 150 million sentences remained and their distribution across the 29 used languages is presented in Figure 2. Unfortunately, very few sentences remained.\"}"}

This toolkit uses a pre-trained multilingual sentence encoder which maps sentences to fixed-length vectors in a common space and, for each source sentence, the k nearest neighbor (we use the default settings: k=4) target sentences are determined in terms of the cosine similarity between the source and the target vectors; and vice versa for each target sentence. Then, it uses a margin-based technique (Artetxe and Schwenk, 2019) for selecting the best sentence pair and penalizes sentences with many paraphrases, (i.e. cases in which a source sentence was paired with multiple target sentences as candidate translations and vice versa). Due to hardware constraints, we decided to divide English corpora (the largest ones) into smaller, more manageable chunks. On one hand, this approach allows us to overcome computational and memory-related issues. On the other hand, dividing the documents into chunks before utilizing LASER, may introduce incorrect sentence pairs as a given sentence in language L1 is used as an alignment candidate in each chunk of L2.\\n\\nTaking this into account and having in mind the nature of our data i.e., news articles that might have been (partially) translated many times and republished on several websites, we examined the existence of paraphrases in the resulting collections of sentence pairs. We investigated cases in the EN-EL (English-Greek) corpus, in which the English part was the same whereas there were various paired EL segments. Experimentally, we concluded that long sentence pairs with a higher score tend to be valid alternative translations. Two indicative examples for EN-NL (English-Dutch and EN-IT (English-Italian) are presented in Table 1. We aim to preserve such cases while discarding the non-valid alternative translations, as they could prove useful for MT systems or in the construction of paraphrase datasets as in Hu et al. (2019).\\n\\n| Source Sentence | Target Sentence |\\n|-----------------|-----------------|\\n| T cells might be able to recognize virally infected cells and destroy them, limiting the virus's spread in the body. | T-cellen herkennen met virussen ge\u00efnfecteerde cellen en vertellen deze cellen dat ze zichzelf moeten vernietigen, zodat het virus zich niet door het hele lichaam kan verspreiden. |\\n| T-cells recognize virus-infected cells and tell those cells to self-destruct, preventing the virus from spreading throughout the body. | Il coautore dello studio Matthew Gidden di Climate Analytics, \u00e8 d'accordo: \u00abL'effetto duraturo del Covid-19 sul clima non dipender\u00e0 da ci\u00f2 che \u00e8 accaduto durante la crisi, ma da ci\u00f2 che verr\u00e0 dopo.\u00bb |\\n| Study co-author Matthew Gidden from Climate Analytics-Berlin said, \u201cThe lasting effect of Covid-19 on climate will not depend on what happens during the crisis, but what comes after.\u201d | \u201cThe lasting effect of COVID-19 on climate will not depend on what happens during the crisis, but what comes after,\u201d said study co-author Matthew Gidden. |\"}"}

We applied the following filters in order to improve the quality and MT-readiness of the dataset:\\n\\n- **Global Threshold:** Sentence pairs with a score lower than 1.04 were removed, as proposed in WikiMatrix (Schwenk et al. 2021).\\n- **Near Deduplication Filter:** Removes near duplicate sentence pairs which emerged because parallel data from different periods were merged into the same file for each language pair.\\n- **Maximum Sentence Length Filter:** Sentence pairs in which either the source or target sentence was longer than 80 tokens were removed.\\n- **Digit Mismatch Filter:** Removes sentence pairs in which the source and the target sentence have varying sequences of digits. Since this is a strict filter, we decided to apply it only to sentence pairs with a score below the threshold of 1.12.\\n- **Alternative Translations Filter:** As explained above, the bilingual corpora contain candidate alternative translations. To exclude the non-valid cases, we kept the sentence pairs with more than 10 tokens in both sentences and with an alignment score higher than 1.06.\\n\\n### 4. Dataset Information\\n\\nOverall, the final dataset comprises 11,248,573 sentence pairs in 26 EN-X language pairs, as presented in Table 2, and has been created in TMX (Translation Memory Exchange) and TSV (Tab-Separated Value) file formats.\\n\\nThis COVID-19 related parallel resource covers 22 out of 24 official EU languages, as well as Albanian, Arabic, Icelandic, Macedonian and Norwegian. There are important variations in the proportion of the parallel sentences among language pairs. For example, the EN-IS (English-Icelandic) corpus contains only a few thousand alignments, while the EN-ES (English-Spanish) corpus approximately 1.5 million.\\n\\nThe contents of the resource are related to COVID-19 and originated mainly from news articles collected from the MediSys dataset. Nevertheless, to further demonstrate the relatedness to COVID-19 of the final corpus, a word cloud of the approximately 60 million English sentences is presented in Figure 3.\\n\\nThe word cloud was created using the Python Wordcloud package using the sentence-splittered and lowercased English monolingual corpus after deduplication and removal of stop words (as well as the removal of the words \u201csaid\u201d and \u201cwill\u201d). As expected, COVID-19 related terms such as \u201ccoronavirus\u201d, \u201chealth\u201d, \u201ccovid\u201d, \u201cpandemic\u201d, \u201cmedical\u201d, \u201cvirus\u201d, \u201coutbreak\u201d, etc. occur quite frequently in the corpus. Furthermore, the frequent appearance of terms such as \u201cglobal\u201d, \u201cpublic\u201d, \u201cstate\u201d, \u201cbusiness\u201d, \u201cnational\u201d, \u201cpresident\u201d, \u201cmarket\u201d, \u201cgovernment\u201d, etc. is quite indicative of the effect of the pandemic on state governance and the global economy.\\n\\nThe news articles originated from several copyrighted websites. We are working towards resolving the IPR (Intellectual Property Rights) issues with the aim of making the resource publicly available.\\n\\n### 5. Conclusion and Future Research\\n\\nIn this paper, we described a collection of bilingual corpora which are related to COVID-19 news. Comparable monolingual corpora were constructed based on the metadata provided by the MediSys dataset and parallel sentences were extracted. Initially motivated by the fact that part of the dataset was used in the Machine Translation task of the COVID-19 MLIA @ Eval initiative, filtering criteria were applied so as to ensure that the bilingual corpora are ready for use in MT systems.\\n\\nThe dataset contains more than 11 million COVID-19 related sentence pairs in 26 EN-X language pairs and may prove a timely and useful resource in adapting MT systems which can be part of a response to the COVID-19 emergency or future similar crises. In future work, we aim to further augment the resource with newly published content, given that batches of metadata for November and December 2021 are already available and motivated by the fact that the need to respond to the pandemic has not diminished. Furthermore, we plan to mine segment alignments across more language pairs (which do not include English) and construct multilingual parallel corpora, as well as to assess the potential of the resource for adapting NMT systems to the domain of COVID-19.\"}"}
