In this paper, we deal with historical ecological knowledge, a special type of TEK that is based on ancient language texts.

Written 2000 years ago, Shanhai Jing is a record of flora and fauna in ancient China, anchored by mountains (shan) and seas (hai). This study focuses on the entities in the Shan Jing part and builds a knowledge base for them.

The PRF values of both entity and relationship extraction are above 96%. Quality assurance measures like entity disambiguation and resolution were done by domain experts. Neo4j graph database is used to visualize the result.

Introduction\\n\\nTraditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) refers to the inherited knowledge of the relationships between living beings in a specific ecosystem. TEK encompasses vital information about the Earth's evolutionary history and the development of human civilization and can be derived from original holders and oral histories (McGregor, 2008; Mustonen, 2019). Integrating TEK with scientific knowledge can assist us in addressing environmental challenges (Gagnon & Berteaux, 2009). Historical ecological knowledge is a special type of TEK. As an initial work in creating China's historical ecological knowledge base, this paper focuses on the historical ecological knowledge in Shan Jing and tries to build a knowledge base for it.\\n\\nShan Jing is a part of the ancient Chinese book Shanhai Jing (the Classic of Mountains and Seas) which was written in the pre-Qin period. Together with Hai Jing (the Classic of Seas) and Huang Jing (the Classic of the Greater World), it constitutes Shanhai Jing seen today. Containing nearly 20,000 words, Shan Jing preserves a significant amount of flora, fauna as well as geographical information two millennia ago. Its abundance of domain-specific entities, along with its unique narrative language, makes the knowledge extraction quite different from the prevalent methodologies in the general knowledge domain of modern Chinese. Based on a detailed analysis of the Shan Jing text, we employ a rule-based method to extract entities in Shan Jing and classify them into a 15-category vocabulary list by referring to the annotations about Shan Jing which were made by scholars from previous generations. The vocabulary list serves as the foundation for knowledge base construction. The entire construction process involves digital text preprocessing, entity and relationship extraction, entity disambiguation and resolution, and knowledge base visualization with Neo4j. The research method and results outlined in this paper hold several practical applications. Firstly, the knowledge base containing systematically classified entities and relationships can provide a foundation for the construction of a historical ecological knowledge base of China, and for the construction of Shan Jing's monograph intelligent book, as well as assisting scholars in their studies about Shan Jing. Furthermore, the rule-based text-matching approach can be employed for the collation of ancient books and other related tasks in ancient language processing. The reasons why this first study focuses only on Shan Jing are the following. Historically, Shan Jing, Hai Jing, and Huang Jing were considered as one book (Shanhai Jing), to be studied and understood together since at least the Han Dynasty (Chen, 2012). However, since the study by Bi Yuan of the Qing Dynasty, there have been ongoing controversies over the relationship between the three parts (Chen 2012). For instance, Liu Zongdi (2006) suggests that Shan Jing is a written record of on-site surveys, while Hai Jing and Huang Jing describe images in words. These controversies imply that Shanhai Jing should not be taken for granted as a unified whole. Another reason is due to operational considerations. Shan Jing shows a logical and highly stylized narrative, while the narratives of Hai Jing and Huang Jing are relatively ambiguous. Since Shan Jing has the best textual coherence and is often considered to be the most reliable empirical account, it is a natural starting point for the construction of a knowledge base. It is expected that the structure of the knowledge base and methodologies developed here can be applied later to Hai Jing and Huang Jing.\"}"}

Related Work\\n\\nGuo Pu (\u90ed\u749e, 276\u2013324 CE) authored the first annotation of Shanhai Jing and heralded a long history of studies on the geology and living beings described in this book. The almost mythical world in Shanhai Jing has great appeal not only to ancient scholars such as Zhu Xi (\u6731\u71b9) and Hao Yixing (\u90dd\u61ff\u884c) but also to scholars today. For example, Woo's (2002) study on Taoism and the ecology of ancient China contained a lot of discussion involved with Shanhai Jing. Guo (2004) attempted to find realistic prototypes for the living beings described in Shanhai Jing from a biological perspective. Strassberg (2018) merged translations from the original work with information on archaeological discoveries to present the fascinating pageant of strange creatures to readers. Furthermore, Fu (2021) considered Shanhai Jing as the origin of the modern ecological narrative, which can help us recall long-lost ecological memories. This paper focuses on analyzing the ecological knowledge in this book from a lexical perspective. In this regard, we would like to give a brief introduction to related work from two aspects: ancient Chinese historical ecological knowledge engineering, and research about Shanhai Jing's lexical items.\\n\\nThe construction of the ancient Chinese historical ecological knowledge base can be traced back to the early 2000s. when Huang et al. (2004) constructed a domain ontology for Tang poems. They adopted the Shakespearean garden approach and manually tagged lexicons for the categories of animal, plant, and artifact, and mapped these historical floral and faunal lexicons to the English-Chinese bilingual wordnet system, Sinica BOW. Similarly, Hsieh et al. (2006) employed a lexicon-driven and ontology-merging methodology to incorporate plant names from Guang-Qun-Fang Pu (\u5e7f\u7fa4\u82b3\u8c31) into Sinica BOW. They conducted a meticulous analysis of the botanical pedigrees in this book. In recent years, machine learning and deep learning techniques have also been applied to this area. Wu et al. (2023) constructed a Chinese named entity recognition model for plants using the CRF algorithm and various deep-learning models. Based on their model, a knowledge graph for plant knowledge in pre-Qin classics was built. Although Wu's work may not fully meet the meticulous requirements of humanities scholars for textual research, the technical approaches they employed provide us with a certain reference for the subsequent construction of China's historical ecological knowledge base.\\n\\nHan Yiying (\u97e9\u4e00\u9e70, 1933; 1936) was the first to research the lexicon of Shanhai Jing. In these two papers, he analyzed the names of animals, plants, and deities in Shanhai Jing based on manually collected information and qualitative studies. Yuan Ke (\u8881\u73c2) should be credited as the first scholar to systematically analyze the lexical items of Shanhai Jing. In his book Shanhai-jing-jiao-zhu (\u5c71\u6d77\u7ecf\u6821\u6ce8) (Yuan 1980), he cataloged over 4000 instances of proper names in Shanhai Jing and arranged them according to stroke order of the first Chinese character. In the 1990s, Korean scholar Kyung Ho Suh (1993) presented the lexical items of Shan Jing, Hai Jing, and Huang Jing in table format in the appendix of his doctoral dissertation. These tables resemble two-dimensional tables in relation databases, which depict the connections between different items. Although both Yuan Ke and Kyung Ho Suh conducted relatively comprehensive research on the lexicon in Shanhai Jing, they focused on inventory rather than classification. This gap was addressed by Jia (2004) in his doctoral thesis. In Jia's thesis, titled Research on Proper Names of Shanhai Jing, he focused on the proper names as the main research objects, dividing them into 18 categories, such as deity's name, prefecture's name, and mountain's name, among others. In the initial stages of our paper, Jia's research served as an important reference for our classification of the lexical system of Shan Jing. However, since our research focuses on building a coherent knowledge system based on Shan Jing, our taxonomy may deviate slightly from Jia's.\\n\\nThe rich historical ecological knowledge in Shanhai Jing provides us with a window to understanding ancient culture. Moreover, by revisiting ancient history, we can better comprehend our relationship with nature and effectively address present-day environmental challenges. However, traditional humanities research has primarily focused on the lexical analysis of the knowledge within Shanhai Jing, with limited consideration given to its expansion and application. In the current wave of digital humanities, we utilize computational methods to organize and categorize the historical ecological knowledge in Shan Jing (which will be expanded to the entire Shanhai Jing in the future) and visualize it via the Neo4j graph database. We hope that our research can fill the gap in historical ecological knowledge engineering in the field of Shanhai Jing studies, and we also hope that it can eventually form a Chinese historical ecological knowledge base together with other ancient Chinese historical ecological knowledge engineering research.\\n\\n3. Pattern-Driven and Bottom-Up Methodology\\n\\nFigure 1 depicts the overall workflow of this paper, which can be divided into two main parts: schema design and knowledge base construction. It is worth noting that there are two extraction tasks in the workflow. One is in the Schema Designing part and the other one is in the Knowledge Base Construction part. In the schema designing phase, the instance extraction aims to collect instances from the text which will be manually categorized later. In the knowledge base construction phase, entity and relationship extraction is performed to transform unstructured text into structured knowledge, facilitating the construction of a knowledge graph. The categorization results from the first extraction will be utilized in the second extraction. Both extractions follow the same syntactic patterns, but the algorithmic logic of the latter extraction is more complex than the former. This section primarily focuses on the design of the schema.\"}"}

Altogether, these five parts consist of a total of 26 chapters. In each chapter of every part, Shan Jing follows a consistent narrative pattern. The three passages presented in Figure 2 are the first three paragraphs of the First Classic of Southern Mountains.\\n\\nIn the introduction of landmarks and their associated products, certain formulaic expressions are used repeatedly. In this figure, colored highlights are used to mark these formulaic patterns, with different colors assigned to different patterns. 1 The meaning of these three paragraphs is:\\n\\nThe first mountain range in the Classic of the Southern Mountains is called Mount Que4. Its first peak is called Mount Zhao1-Yao2. It is close to the West Sea. It has lots of cinnamon trees, gold and jade. There is a kind of grass on this mountain which looks like an onion, but it has green flowers. Its name is Zhu4-Yu3. If you eat it, you won't starve. There is a kind of tree on the mountain which looks like the paper mulberry, but it has black markings. Its blossoms light up everything around it. Its name is Mi2-Gu3. If you wear it in your belt, you won't get lost. There is a kind of animal on the mountain which looks like a long-tailed ape, but it has white ears. It crouches as it moves along and it runs like a human. Its name is Sheng1-Sheng1. If you eat it. You'll be a good runner. The River Li4-Ji3 originates from here and flows westwards to empty into the sea. It has lots of Yu4-Pei4, if you wear some in your belt, you won't suffer from worms.\\n\\nFigure 2: The passages in Shan Jing.\\n\\nFrom these three paragraphs, we can get a general understanding of the narrative style of Shan Jing. By further analyzing the first chapter of each of the five sections (the Classic of Southern/Western/Northern/Eastern/Central Mountains), we can summarize the following schemas:\\n\\n\u53c8 {\u65b9\u5411} {\u8ddd\u79bb} \u91cc\uff0c\u66f0 {\u5c71\u540d}\u4e4b\u5c71\uff0c\u4e34\u4e8e/\u671b\u4e8e/\u931e\u4e8e{\u5730\u540d}\uff0c\u591a/\u65e0 {\u7269\u4ea7\u540d}\u3002\\n\u6709 {\u7269\u4ea7\u7c7b\u522b}\u7109\uff0c(\u5176\u72b6\u5982\u2026\u2026,\u5176\u97f3\u5982\u2026\u2026),\u5176\u540d\u66f0 {\u7269\u4ea7\u540d}\u3002\\n{\u6c34\u540d}\u51fa\u7109,\u800c {\u65b9\u5411}\u6d41\u6ce8\u4e8e {\u6c34\u540d}\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u591a/\u65e0 {\u7269\u4ea7\u540d}\u2026\u2026\u3002\\n\\n2 {distance} leagues further {direction} is a mountain called {mountain name}, is close to {landmark name}.

The {river name} originates from here and flows {direction} to empty into {river name}. It has lots of/has no {resource name}\u2026\u2026.\\n\\nIn the above schemas, each pair of curly brackets contains either a named entity or a property assigned to a particular named entity, as annotated above.

Occasionally, it also mentions other landmarks after the mountain, such as the West Sea in the \\\"Mount Que\\\" paragraph.\\n\\nRepresenting such information in the text using triplets, we can identify the following relationship types:\\n\\n- The relationship between mountains: (Mount A, direction, Mount B).\\n- The relationship between mountain and river: (River A, originates from, Mount B).\\n- The relationship between rivers: (River A, direction flows into, River B).\\n- The relationship between the mountain and its resources: (Mount A, has (lots of)/ has no, [animals, plants, minerals et al.]).\\n- The relationship between the river and its resources: (River A, has (lots of)/ has no, [animals, plants, minerals et al.]).\\n- The relationship between mountain and other landmarks: (Mount A, is close to, landmark B).\\n\\nFor the fourth and fifth relationship, the animals and plants within the product resources can be further classified into more specific categories. For instance, the plant species mentioned in Shan Jing can be categorized into two subcategories: trees and grasses.\\n\\n3.2 Pattern-based Instance Extraction\\n\\nBased on the analysis of Shan Jing's syntactic structures, we have designed corresponding regular expressions to extract instances from them. Then these instances will be manually classified into different vocabularies.\\n\\nAs the narrative patterns in section 3.1 show, in Shan Jing, each entity is anchored by a specific syntactic pattern, which is usually a verb or verb phrase but can also be a prepositional phrase. In this paper, we mainly use the six patterns in Table 1 to conduct the corresponding entity extraction (relationship extraction as well).\\n\\n| No. | Syntactic Pattern | Instance |\\n|-----|------------------|----------|\\n| 1   | \u53c8 {direction} {distance}  | is a mountain called Mount {mountain name} |\\n| 2   | {river name} \u51fa\u7109 | The {river name} originates from here |\\n| 3   | \u800c {direction} \u6d41\u6ce8\u4e8e {river name} | flows {direction} to empty into {river name} |\\n| 4   | \u591a/\u65e0 {resource name} | has lots of/has no {resource name} |\\n| 5   | \u6709 {resource category} \u7109, \u2026\u2026, \u5176\u540d\u66f0 {resource name} | There is a kind of {resource category} on this mountain, \u2026\u2026, Its name is {resource name} |\\n| 6   | \u4e34\u4e8e/\u671b\u4e8e/\u931e\u4e8e {landmark name} | close to {landmark name} |\\n\\nWe can see that for instances of mountains and other landmarks, we only need to use one syntactic pattern to do the extraction. For the instances of river and resource, we need to use two rules to extract them respectively. This is because when introducing rivers, different descriptions are used for the origin and endpoint of the river; when introducing resources, Shan Jing provides both detailed and concise descriptions. By utilizing regular expressions alone, we can extract a significant portion of instances from Shan Jing. These instances can then be checked with Shan Jing's text to do further categorization.\\n\\n3.3 Vocabulary Building and Upper-level Schema\\n\\nDesigning the instances extracted in section 3.2, especially those belonging to product resources, can be further divided into different categories. We classify these resources such as grass, birds, fish, and so on, ultimately dividing the instances from the Shan Jing into 15 different categories. Then we build vocabulary for each category and assign alphabetical tags to it, as shown in Table 2. These category tags will be used in the construction of the knowledge graph.\\n\\n| Tag-Category Pair |\\n|-------------------|\\n| A     - mountain  |\\n| B     - river      |\\n| C     - grass       |\\n| D     - tree        |\\n| E     - bird        |\\n| F     - beast       |\\n| G     - snake       |\\n| H     - mineral     |\\n| I     - fish        |\\n| J     - shell       |\\n| K     - turtle      |\\n| L     - other aquatic life |\\n| M     - deity       |\\n| N     - other landmark |\\n| O     - other       |\\n\\nBased on the analysis of Shan Jing's narrative structure and its category system, we design the top schema for future knowledge base construction, which is shown in Figure 3. In this figure, the rectangles represent entities and the arrows represent relationships. To make the final knowledge base also show the chapter information, we also added the Classic name \u7ecf\u540d and the chapter information (the item in the dotted boxes) in addition to the entities mentioned above. The items in the solid boxes and the associated relationships correspond completely to the triplets mentioned above.\\n\\n4. The Construction of Knowledge Base\\n\\nAs Figure 1 shows, the construction of a knowledge base involves four main parts: text preprocessing, entity and relationship extraction, entity disambiguation and resolution, and knowledge base visualization.\"}"}

It comes from the First Edition of the Four Series \u56db\u90e8\u4e1b\u520a\u521d\u7f16, which was written during the Chenghua period of the Ming Dynasty.\\n\\nSince this paper employs a rule-based method for knowledge extraction, there is no need to do word segmentation. The text preprocessing mainly involves correcting errors in the digital text. We proofread the digital text with its original photocopy and Yuan Ke's Shanhai Jing Full Translation \u5c71\u6d77\u7ecf\u5168\u8bd1 (2016), making necessary corrections to the identified errors in the text. The collated version of Shan Jing contains 26,681 Chinese characters (including punctuation), 1,445 sentences, and 481 paragraphs. It is noteworthy that ancient Chinese literature lacks punctuation, and the punctuation seen in Shan Jing today was added by scholars in later periods. As punctuation plays a crucial role in knowledge extraction, we primarily relied on Yuan Ke's Shanhai Jing Full Translation to rectify the inappropriate punctuation in the text. For instance, following Yuan Ke's book, we revised \\\"\u591a\u91d1\u7389\\\" (has lots of gold and jade) to \\\"\u591a\u91d1\u3001\u7389\\\".\\n\\n4.2 Entity and Relation Extraction\\n\\nThe entity and relation extraction process is similar to the previously mentioned instance extraction process: the same syntactic patterns (see Table 1) are used, but this time we also have to pay attention to the relations that were ignored in the instance extraction. The verb/prepositional phrases in Table 1, which we used as patterns to extract instances also convey the relationships between different entities. For example, \\\"\u591a\\\" (has lots of) and \\\"\u6d41\u6ce8\u4e8e\\\" (flows into) not only aid in locating entities but also indicate the semantic relationship between entities. By focusing mainly on these phrases, we can extract entities and relationships simultaneously.\\n\\nFigure 3: The schema of knowledge base.\\n\\nThe extraction process can be seen as a transformation of unstructured text data into fully structured tabular data. In addition to the regular expressions, an algorithm is required to accurately store the entities and their relationships. The algorithm presented in Table 3 employs a loop structure that takes paragraphs as larger units and sentences as smaller units to extract entities and relationships. The extracted results from the same passage are stored in the same row, with the entities and relationships categorized and stored in corresponding columns. To avoid confusion between entities and their relationships, the category tags in Table 2 are added as prefixes to the entities during storage. Additionally, for entities associated with product resources, a numeric tag is added to distinguish different \\\"has\\\" relationships (\u591a has lots of \u2013 0, \u65e0 has no \u2013 1, \u6709 there is a kind of \u2013 2).\\n\\nAlgorithm: knowledge extraction and storage\\n\\nInput: Shan Jing text, vocabulary list\\n\\nOutput: Similar-relation database\\n\\n1) define different column indexes to different entity/relationship categories\\n2) for paragraph i in Shan Jing's text:\\n3) for sentence j in paragraph i:\\n4) extract entities and directions in the sentence\\n5) check the category of the entity\\n6) add category-tag as a prefix to the entity\\n7) if the entity is a product:\\n8) check the verb in the corresponding\"}"}

After completing the extraction, we manually review all of them by referring to the original text. Therefore, we can say that our test set consists of the entire text of Shan Jing. Due to the uneven distribution of entities and relationships in different categories, we chose to measure the performance of the model using Micro-PRF. We first calculate the sum of true positives (TP), false positives (FP), and false negatives (FN) for all categories in the entity confusion matrix and relationship confusion matrix, then get the averages of these sums. Finally, we use these averages to calculate the overall precision, recall, and F1 score.\\n\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\text{micro-P} = \\\\frac{\\\\sum_{i} TP_i}{\\\\sum_{i} TP_i + \\\\sum_{i} FP_i + \\\\sum_{i} FN_i}\\n\\\\]\\n\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\text{micro-R} = \\\\frac{\\\\sum_{i} TP_i}{\\\\sum_{i} TP_i + \\\\sum_{i} FN_i}\\n\\\\]\\n\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\text{micro-F} = 2 \\\\times \\\\frac{\\\\text{micro-P} \\\\times \\\\text{micro-R}}{\\\\text{micro-P} + \\\\text{micro-R}}\\n\\\\]\\n\\nTable 6 depicts our final performance data. Both the precision and recall rates are above 96%, indicating that the pattern-driven method is well-suited for initial digital humanities studies on Shan Jing.\\n\\n| Symbol              | Precision | Recall  | F1      |\\n|---------------------|-----------|---------|---------|\\n| Entity Extraction   | 96.6%     | 96.35%  | 96.387% |\\n| Relation Extraction | 96.516%   | 96.895% | 96.705% |\\n\\n4.3 Entity Disambiguation and Resolution\\n\\nEntity disambiguation aims to resolve the ambiguity of entities that have the same or similar names but represent different concepts or entities in the real world. Entity resolution, on the other hand, focuses on identifying mentions that are not the same but refer to the same concept or real-world entity. In Shan Jing, some entities share the same name but denote different things, while other entities with different names refer to the same object. Therefore, the tasks of entity disambiguation and entity resolution become necessary. Given that in Shan Jing's text determining the correct referent of these entities requires expert knowledge, entity disambiguation, and entity resolution are performed manually.\\n\\nLet's discuss entity disambiguation first. In Shan Jing, entities with the same name but referring to different things can be divided into two types. The first type (type A) includes entities that have the same name and belong to the same category, mainly mountains. For example, \u201c\u4e19\u5c71\u201d (Mount Bing3) appears in both the Tenth Classic of Central Mountains and the Twelfth Classic of Central Mountains but refers to different mountains. The second type (type B) includes entities that share the same name but belong to different categories. For instance, \u201c\u80a5\u9057\u201d (Fei3 Yi2) in the First Classic of Western Mountains refers to a type of bird; while in the First Classic of Southern Mountains, it represents a type of snake.\\n\\nFor entities of type A, we assign a unique node ID to each of them. When building the knowledge graph, we handle these entities individually, while we process other entities in batches. For type B entities, we add category tags to them. This allows the computer program to identify the correct category of these entities based on the tag.\"}"}

For example, in the Second Classic of Southern Mountains, the phrase \\\"\u5317\u671b\u8bf8\u6bd7, \u4e1c\u671b\u957f\u53f3\\\" (to the north it faces Zhu1 Pi2, to the east it faces Chang2 You4) uses the abbreviations \\\"\u8bf8\u6bd7\\\" and \\\"\u957f\u53f3\\\" for \\\"\u8bf8\u6bd7\u4e4b\u5c71\\\" (Mount Zhu1 Pi2) and \\\"\u957f\u53f3\u4e4b\u5c71\\\" (Mount Chang2 You4) respectively. During the entity resolution process, we manually expand these abbreviations into their full written forms.\\n\\n4.4 Knowledge Base Visualization\\nWe use the py2neo module in Python to connect to the Neo4j graph database. In this phase, we also add 26 chapter entities and 5 classic name entities to the knowledge base. As for the relationships between the classic name entities, the chapter entities, and the entities we previously extracted, we can refer to the schema in Figure 3. Therefore, the number of entities and relationships in our final knowledge graph is slightly higher than the statistical values given in Table 4 and Table 5. The total number of entities and relationships in the knowledge graph are 1432 and 3294 respectively. Figure 4 is a part of our final knowledge graph. It shows us the chapter structures in each section of Shan Jing. When you click on any chapter entity, the graph will display the mountain ranges contained in it. By further clicking on a particular mountain, you will be presented with the associated river and resource entities.\\n\\n5. Applications\\nBased on the knowledge base of Shan Jing, combined with the relevant works from other Chinese historical texts, building a Chinese historical ecological knowledge base is what we attempt to do in the future. To build the Shan Jing knowledge base, we systematically collect and classify the entities and relationships in Shan Jing, spending much time and effort to manually retrieve various related studies. The results provide the necessary database foundation for building a Chinese historical ecological knowledge base. As far as the study of Shan Jing or Shanhai Jing is concerned, the methods and the results of this paper can also provide help to related scholars. Here, the application value of this paper is only explained from the following three aspects: aiding in the collation of Shan Jing texts, assisting scholars to conduct quantitative studies, and providing a corpus base for Shan Jing's monograph intelligent book.\\n\\n5.1 Provide Assistance to the Collation of Shan Jing Text\\nAncient Chinese is more likely to have some specific syntactic patterns than modern Chinese. As noted by Li (2020) during her utilization of regular expressions to analyze the poem titles in *Mao Shi Zhengyi* (Annotations on the Book of Songs), regular expressions assist in defining and summarizing general patterns. By examining and analyzing any exceptions that deviate from the pattern, they also aid in identifying errors in the text. Similarly, when applying regular expressions to match the text of Shan Jing, we discover their effectiveness in identifying textual errors within this book as well. For example, when processing the First Classic of Southern Mountains, the regular expression fails to extract the mountain entity from the sentence \\\"\u4e1c\u4e09\u767e\u91cc\u67e2\u5c71\\\" (Three hundred leagues further east is Mount Di3). Upon reviewing the annotations made\"}"}

Similar problems arise in sentences such as \\\"\u53c8\u897f\u767e\u4e94\u5341\u91cc\u9ad8\u5c71\\\" (One hundred and fifty leagues further west is Mount Gao), \\\"(\u6709\u517d\u7109)\u5176\u540d\u957f\u53f3\\\" (There is a kind of beast, its name is Chang You), \\\"(\u6709\u9e1f\u7109)\u66f0\u6a50\ud864\uddef\\\" (There is a kind of bird, its name is Tuo2 Fei2), and so on.\\n\\n5.2 Help Scholar to Conduct Quantitative Study\\n\\nTraditional humanities research primarily relies on qualitative analysis of texts, although quantitative processing is occasionally included. Wu (2020) analyzed the mountains in Shan Jing that have no vegetation (\u65e0\u8349\u6728). He identified a total of 447 mountains, 95 of which were \\\"without vegetation.\\\" The knowledge base of our paper can assist in such an analysis. Using the Cypher statement MATCH(p1:Other classes{name:\\\"\u8349\u6728\\\"})<-[:r:'\u65e0']-(p2) in Neo4j, we can query mountains that fulfill the triplet (mountain, has no, vegetation). The result is depicted in Figure 5. The gray circle in the center of the image represents the entity \\\"vegetation,\\\" while the dark blue entities scattered around it represent the mountains that are \\\"without vegetation.\\\" The total number of 95 mountains matches the statistics we mentioned in his article.\\n\\nFigure 5: The knowledge graph about mountains without vegetation.\\n\\n5.3 Provide Corpus Basis for Shan Jing\u2019s Monograph Intelligent Book\\n\\nShanhai Jing is of great importance in ancient Chinese culture. When discussing topics of ancient Chinese mythology, geography, and ecosystems, it is impossible to exclude Shanhai Jing from the conversation. Since Guo Pu\u2019s first annotation about Shanhai Jing, scholars from different dynasties have shown varying degrees of interest in this book, with many putting considerable effort into analyzing and explaining the entities mentioned in it. Table 6 presents a collection of monographs on Shanhai Jing written before the Republic of China. These works have served as important references for modern scholars who wish to engage in the study of Shanhai Jing. Examples include Yuan Ke (2016) and his Shanhai Jing Full Translation, Shen Haibo (2015) and his collated version of Shanhai Jing, and Guo Fu (2004) and his scholarly work Attestment to Shanhai Jing.\"}"}

Since most of these monographs analyze both entities and their associated annotations, we can break down the scholars' research into individual annotations. For each entity, we collect and organize these annotations from different scholars and present them collectively to readers. This approach allows researchers to gain a comprehensive understanding of the entity efficiently, saving them time.\\n\\nFigure 6 shows the interface designed for the intelligent book of Shan Jing's monographs. The leftmost column displays the chapter list of Shan Jing, while the center section presents a text fragment extracted from Shan Jing. In the upper right corner, a knowledge graph corresponding to the text in the center is displayed. When hovering the mouse cursor over a proper name in the text or an entity in the knowledge graph, such as \\\"\u72cc\u72cc\\\" (Sheng Sheng) in the image, all annotations by previous scholars on that entity are automatically displayed in the lower right corner. This approach increases the reader's convenience compared to the traditional method where researchers have to go through extensive studies for a comprehensive understanding about the entity. The use of intelligent books offers a solution that mitigates the criticism of academic fragmentation and disconnection often associated with traditional humanities research (Burdick et al., 2018). In this way, with the widespread dissemination of knowledge bases, accessibility to comprehensive information can be improved.\\n\\n6. Conclusion\\nWe report in this paper the construction of a knowledge base for Shan Jing as the first step toward recovering the ecological knowledge of China two millennia ago. The knowledge base covers 15 categories of entities and 6 types of relationships and provides both a foundation and a historical baseline for future construction of China's historical and ecological knowledge databases. This study also adds the dimension of the annotation of geographic and environmental information to ancient language processing. In addition to the extension to cover the entire Shanhai Jing, including the inclusion of the descriptive texts and later annotations associated with these entities. A challenging further development is to develop a feature system of descriptive terms and the integration of a GIS with historical layers.\"}"}
