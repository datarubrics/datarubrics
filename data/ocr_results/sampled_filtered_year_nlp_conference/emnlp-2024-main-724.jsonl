We study one such social issue: homelessness in the U.S., by leveraging the remarkable capabilities of large language models to assist social work experts in analyzing millions of posts from Twitter. We introduce a framing typology: Online Attitudes Towards Homelessness (OATH) Frames: nine hierarchical frames capturing critiques, responses and perceptions. We release annotations with varying degrees of assistance from language models, with immense benefits in scaling: 6.5\u00d7 speedup in annotation time while only incurring a 3 point $F_1$ reduction in performance with respect to the domain experts. Our experiments demonstrate the value of modeling OATH-Frames over existing sentiment and toxicity classifiers. Our large-scale analysis with predicted OATH-Frames on 2.4M posts on homelessness reveal key trends in attitudes across states, time periods and vulnerable populations, enabling new insights on the issue. Our work provides a general framework to understand nuanced public attitudes at scale, on issues beyond homelessness.\\n\\n1 Introduction\\n\\nPublic opinion towards social issues is used as a signal by advocacy organizations to garner support for their relief and reform efforts (Burstein, 2020). Online social media platforms, such as Twitter, serve as a great repository of public opinion from a diverse (e.g., socio-economic and political) user base (Hu et al., 2021). However, understanding broader public opinion necessitates processing online discourse at a large scale, a daunting challenge in social science research. Large language models (LLMs) have recently been used in social science (Ziems et al., 2023; Cho et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023; Bohra et al., 2023), and may offer a promising solution to the scale challenge. However, can LLMs be reliably used to process discourse with nuanced latent attitudes towards complex societal issues? One such issue is homelessness in the U.S., which inspires complex and nuanced public attitudes and beliefs (Robertson and Greenblatt, 1992). For instance, it is common for people to simultaneously feel both sympathy towards the plight of people experiencing homelessness (PEH), as well as anger and resentment towards them (Cronley, 2010; Moore et al., 1988; Narayan and Petesch, 2002). A majority of work from social science has studied discourse about homelessness via ethnographic studies, qualitative surveys, and smaller scale content analyses (Kim et al., 2023; Tsai et al., 2019; Kingree and Daves, 1997). However, understanding the societal attitudes about homelessness at a large scale via online discourse has rarely been attempted in prior efforts. Our work investigates the role of LLMs in reliably assisting social work experts in characterizing such large-scale online discourse on homelessness.\\n\\nIn this work, we introduce a novel framework to understand, synthesize and characterize large-scale public attitudes towards societal issues through a collaboration between social work experts and LLMs, illustrated in Figure 1. Our framework consists of three components designed to study written discourse on social issues: (i) the discovery of a framing typology ($\\\\S$2), (ii) annotation of data at scale with this typology ($\\\\S$3), and (iii) the analysis of these collected annotations ($\\\\S$4). While we focus our study on homelessness, our framework is generalizable to other domains of social discourse.\\n\\nAt the heart of our framework is our novel framing typology to characterize Online Attitudes Towards Homelessness (OATH) Frames.\"}"}

Domain experts applied grounded theory to surface nine Issue-specific frames, their corresponding definitions (OATH-Definitions), and annotation guidelines (OATH-Guidelines). (2.) We annotated posts with OATH-Frames via Experts, via Experts + LLM (GPT-4), and via Multilabel Classifier (Flan-T5-Large). Our Experts + LLM annotations pipeline consists of (2.1) prompt editing based on insights from domain experts and chains-of-thought, and (2.2) validation of predicted frames. (3.) We analyzed annotated posts for attitudes across social and political dimensions.\\n\\nTowards Homelessness (OATH-Frames) in the U.S., as expressed in social media posts from Twitter (\u00a72). Our frames are developed using framing theory (Entman, 1993) and grounded theory (Glaser and Strauss, 1967) from social science, and in collaboration with social work researchers studying homelessness. OATH-Frames can be broadly categorized into three themes: Critiques, Perceptions and Responses to PEH, and further into nine finer-grained Issue-specific frames; Table 1 illustrates our typology with examples. We provide three kinds of OATH-Frames annotations for posts from Twitter: 4.1K expert-only (\u00a73.1), 4.1K LLM-assisted expert (\u00a73.2) and 2.4M predicted annotations from a multi-label classification model (\u00a73.3). Our LLM-assisted expert annotation for socially sensitive tasks follows a new scalable framework which incorporates expert insights (OATH-Guidelines) and chain-of-thought (CoT) explanations for designing better LLM prompts. This results in a 6.5x annotation speedup, while incurring only a 3 point F1 reduction in accuracy compared to experts\u2014an attractive trade-off for our multi-label annotation task.\\n\\nWe observe that the most salient theme in expert-only annotations is Perceptions of PEH while the rest of our annotations highlight Critiques of the government, normative structures and (lack of) aid distribution (Figure 2). Our 2.4M OATH-Frames-annotated posts enable a large-scale analysis across states and time periods, revealing changing trends in attitudes with key sociopolitical events (\u00a74). OATH-Frames surface harmful language towards PEH, which we show are often mislabeled by popular sentiment and toxicity classifiers, highlighting the value of our typology. We empirically establish trends where differences in attitudes are observed, when vulnerable populations are compared with PEH; for instance, comparisons with immigrants elicit harmful rhetoric whereas those with Ukrainians elicit critiques towards the government for funding allocation. OATH-Frames can assist in understanding nuanced issues concerning marginalized PEH populations, often ignored in language technologies (Kiritchenko et al., 2023). Overall, our framework provides a blueprint for fast and scalable analysis of public opinion on key social issues of our time; we believe this will aid advocacy groups and political constituents in work towards meaningful social...\"}"}

We discarded posts which we deemed ambiguous, underspecified or unrelated (e.g. political homelessness). We also discarded posts containing first person lived experiences of PEH, since our focus was on studying public attitudes on homelessness.\\n\\nNext, we followed an extensive iterative \u2018coding\u2019 process based on grounded theory from social science (Glaser and Strauss, 1967) to surface our OATH-Frames where \u2018codes\u2019 are 1-2 word descriptors of the data. The coding process involved our four domain experts independently analyzing a sample of 100 posts to conceptualize a unique categorization of attitudes. This was followed by a discussion where all posts were reviewed and similar frames were grouped together till we reached consensus on definitions, edge cases and representative examples. We repeated this process thrice on different sets of posts with refined iterations of our frames until we reached thematic saturation which surfaced nine fine-grained Issue-specific frames under homelessness; see our OATH-Definitions in Table 1. Appendix A.1 provides our experts\u2019 OATH-Guidelines developed during Frame Discovery that contain detailed definitions and steps on how to address edge cases.\\n\\nOur Issue-specific frames can be categorized into three overarching themes, as illustrated in Figure 1 (Frame Discovery). First, we find Critiques of systems and institutions enabling homelessness and also the use of homelessness as a vehicle to critique others (e.g. actors, programs or spending). Second, we find posts reflecting different Perceptions of PEH which attribute undesirable characteristics to PEH to make harmful generalizations. Third, we find many Responses to the issue, posed as solutions, interventions, calls to action and charitable acts. Our three themes are consistent with those in prior work on homelessness (Baiocchi and Arguello, 2019; Gowan, 2010), but our work is the first to surface nine Issue-specific (homelessness) frames providing more fine-grained insights.\\n\\n3 Annotation of OATH-Frames\\n\\n3.1 Expert Annotation\\n\\nOur four domain experts leading the frame discovery effort (\u00a72) trained two other annotators (trained experts). The trainees first familiarized themselves with OATH-Definitions and OATH-Guidelines as detailed in Appendix A.1. Next, the trainees labeled 20 posts with OATH-Frames where the experts clarified questions about OATH-Definitions. Finally, the trainees performed an independent annotation exercise on a set of 280 posts annotated by the domain experts. The training concluded once the trainee achieved moderate agreement (Fleiss\u2019 $\\\\kappa > 0.4$ ; Fleiss, 1971) with the experts.\\n\\nFor all relevant posts, each expert (domain and trained) annotator performs a 9-way-multilabel classification of Issue-specific frames, where 54% of the posts were labeled with more than one frame.

We observe that CoT serves as a signal to understanding misinterpretations of OATH-Definitions and benefits from addition of expert annotator guidelines (OATH-Guidelines).\\n\\nIt is now being deployed as annotation assistants in social science (Li et al., 2023; Bohra et al., 2023), but questions on how best to incorporate insights from social science into LLMs still remain (Nelson et al., 2024; Gondimalla et al., 2024); also see Appendix E.3. We explore a collaborative setting for annotating OATH-Frames with LLM assistants to our expert annotators to ameliorate their manual and emotional labor. We first investigate the ability of GPT-4 (Achiam et al., 2023) to do our annotation task stand-alone (\u00a73.2.1), before describing our collaborative framework (Expert+GPT-4; \u00a73.2.2).\\n\\n**3.2.1 Predicting OATH-Frames with only GPT-4**\\n\\nWe design our prompts for GPT-4 by incorporating instructions and examples as well as our own OATH-Guidelines and GPT-4\u2019s own Chain-of-Thought reasoning (CoT; Wei et al., 2022), in an iterative setup as shown in Figure 3. Building on prior work (Pangakis et al., 2023; Rytting et al., 2023), we observe that CoT serves as a signal to understanding misinterpretations of OATH-Definitions and benefits from addition of expert annotator guidelines (OATH-Guidelines).\\n\\nOur prompt refinement pipeline could be generalized to other social science tasks, where practitioners could use LLM CoT and their expert annotator guidelines to leverage LLMs as annotation assistants. Appendix B.2 details the prompts we used.\\n\\nWe report GPT-4\u2019s performance on a subset of 280 multiply-annotated posts (|Dagreement| = 280) in Table 2. GPT-4 achieves a precision of 0.39 \u00b1 0.05 and recall of 0.64 \u00b1 0.05 across all nine Issue-specific frames showing that it may have reasonable coverage of the predicted labels but also produces false positives due to the inherent social nuances in the posts that may be easier for an expert to resolve. For example, GPT-4 often confuses the SocCrit. and GovCrit. frames, seen in the following post:\\n\\n@mention it appears the problem in el paso with illegal aliens were solved overnight, so that you could have a photo op without anyone seeing hundreds of homeless illegals on the streets. Here, although the government is not explicitly mentioned, politicians often enact displacement sweeps and photo-ops to disguise the severity of the homelessness crisis. We observe that GPT-4 is not able to resolve domain-specific references (i.e. displacement sweeps) and thus predicts both SocCrit. and GovCrit. (Table 7). In these cases, it\u2019s important to have experts validate the predictions.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**3.2.2 Predicting OATH-Frames with Expert+GPT-4**\\n\\nAlthough LLMs serve as a useful tool to efficiently generate annotations, the inherent subjectivity and sensitivity of our task poses a challenge to using GPT-4 as an annotator on its own (Rytting et al., 2023; Heseltine and Clemm von Hohenberg, 2024).\"}"}

We generate GPT-4 predictions on a set of 4.4K posts. Through expert validation, we filter out 300 posts, resulting in 4.1K Expert+GPT-4 validated posts. Our expert validation involves discarding false positive labels by GPT-4; this results in a 12 point boost in precision and a slight drop in recall compared to GPT-4 generations. We note that by themselves, experts take 187.49 (\u00b1 30.71) seconds, whereas with Expert+GPT-4, they take 28.80 (\u00b1 8.55) seconds, which is a 6.5\u00d7 boost in annotation speed. Overall, Expert+GPT-4 results in a 6 point increase in macro F\\n1 over GPT-4; see Table 2.\\n\\n3.3 Scaling OATH-Frames\\n\\nAnnotations\\n\\nWhile Expert+GPT-4 reduces manual labor, annotations by Expert and Expert+GPT-4 are relatively cost-intensive at a larger scale. To this end, we scale OATH-Frames annotations using a model trained with Expert and Expert+GPT-4 annotations. We obtain 10.4k training examples: 5.3K Expert and 4.1K Expert+GPT-4 annotations and 1K filtered posts. We split these into a train-val-test split containing 8217, 913 and 1280 posts respectively and train a Flan-T5-Large (Chung et al., 2022) model for 10-way multilabel classification (nine OATH-Frames and filter). Results in Table 2 show that Flan-T5-Large performs better than GPT-4 with a Macro F\\n1 of 0.51 \u00b1 0.05, and is on par with the Expert+GPT-4 setting on the Agreement Test Set (|Dagreement|=280). We also find that Flan-T5-Large obtains a Macro F\\n1 score of 0.50 on a larger test set of 1280 posts (|Dtest|=1280). Among four fine-tuned size-variants of Flan-T5, and zero-shot Llama-2-7b (Touvron et al., 2023), Flan-T5-Large performs the best; detailed results and data settings are provided in Appendix C.\\n\\nUsing our trained Flan-T5-Large model, we generate OATH-Frames predictions on a set of 2.4M unlabeled posts. Figure 2 illustrates that the distribution of frames under different annotation strategies is similar. Next, we use the 2.4M predicted annotations in a large-scale socio-political analysis of public attitudes.\\n\\n4 Analyzing Posts with OATH-Frames\\n\\nSynthesizing public opinion using online discourse is useful for advocacy groups and policymakers to inform homelessness services and equitable housing policies to local communities (Burstein, 2020). We demonstrate the utility of OATH-Frames to such end users by analyzing attitudes with respect to state mentions, marginalized populations, and time period on the set of 2.4M posts. We also highlight the utility of our OATH-Frames over sentiment and toxicity labels.\"}"}

We investigate how existing toxicity and sentiment classifiers capture harmful rhetoric against PEH as represented by the HarmGen. frame. We plot the distribution of Figure 4: Distributions of sentiment and toxicity scores for posts labeled with and without HarmGen. in our subset of 4.1K Expert-annotated posts. The Perspective API 7 toxicity score and sentiment scores (Rosenthal et al., 2017) in Figure 4 for the subset of Expert-annotated posts labeled with HarmGen. We find that a majority of HarmGen. posts are labeled with a toxicity of less than 0.5, indicating a high false negative rate. For example, the following post contains harmful stereotypes against PEH but was tagged with a toxicity score of less than 0.5: '@mention some people wear clothes at home i wear for an outing and here i dress up like a homeless person inside my home whos a drug addict and has been sleeping since forever'.\\n\\nFurthermore, the negative sentiment distributions for posts labeled with and without HarmGen. are significantly similar (independent samples t-test: \\\\( p < .001 \\\\)) indicating that sentiment classifiers are not able to represent HarmGen. against PEH. This highlights that OATH-Frames provides a framework characterizing how PEH may experience harms and subtle stereotyping, going beyond sentiment and toxicity. Our framework can serve to improve existing classifiers in detecting such harms, especially for underrepresented communities (Dorn et al., 2023).\\n\\n4.1.1 Case Study: Solutions and Interventions in Posts Mentioning California\\n\\nGiven the high rates of PEH in California (CA accounted for 49% of U.S. unsheltered PEH in 2023), we investigate the proposed SolnInt. for posts that mention CA. We measure the statistical prevalence of a term in CA posts in two subsets: posts labeled with SolnInt. and posts labeled with a positive sentiment probability (\\\\( p(+) > 0.5 \\\\)) (Rosenthal et al., 2017) in our set of 2.4M posts.\\n\\n| Term     | (+) SolnInt.

Scores outside the range \\\\([1.96, -1.96]\\\\) are considered statistically significant. Full set of results are included in Table 13.\\n\\nWe calculate Monroe et al.'s (2017) weighted log-odds ratio with a Dirichlet informed prior for unigrams/bigrams. By incorporating a prior estimate over the expected distribution of the vocabulary, this approach accounts for words that are very commonly or rarely prevalent in the two subsets of posts. Table 3 shows 5 significant terms in each subset and their z-score.\\n\\nWe find that in posts labeled with (+) SolnInt., OATH-Frames captures more comprehensive insights specific to homelessness in CA. Whereas posts labeled with a positive sentiment (\\\\( p(+) \\\\)) contain more generic insights (i.e., 'great, love, help'). For example, 'abandon, voucher', and 'bass' refer to LA Mayor Karen Bass's homelessness initiative: 'Inside Safe' that converted abandoned hotels to temporary shelters for PEH (Ure, 2023) whereas 'rent' and 'healthcare' are considered as drivers of homelessness in CA and potential entry points for interventions. Although sentiment classifiers provide coarse-grained insights of conflating factors in relation to homelessness (e.g., substance use, crime), we find that OATH-Frames provide more targeted insights specific to CA.\\n\\n4.2 Attitudes across State Mentions\\n\\nDiscourse on homelessness is closely tied to a state's social and economic climate and the prevalence of PEH in each region (Tsai et al., 2019).

We find that HarmGen. is the most prominent Issue-specific frame in posts about California, Washington and Oregon and (Un)Deserv. and MoneyAid. are the most prominent in posts about New York (see Figure 12, Table 10 in Appendix D). To better understand the drivers of attitudes in a state, we also estimated a linear regression for two state level factors (i.e. cost of living index, percent of unsheltered PEH) in relation to the proportion of posts labeled with frames. We find that a high cost of living index ($R^2$ of 0.61) correlates to a larger proportion of GovCrit. whereas a larger unsheltered PEH population correlates to more HarmGen. ($R^2$ of 0.45) and less (Un)Deserv.\\n\\nWe hypothesize that greater visibility of PEH in the west coast, which is due to a larger unsheltered population (68% in California compared to 4.9% in New York), results in HarmGen. and in contrast, posts about New York are more likely to contain (Un)Deserv. attitudes due to an influx of asylum seekers and immigrants in 2023 (Sousa et al., 2023). In addition, higher costs of living elicit more GovCrit. for economic reform and reducing rent prices.\\n\\n### 4.3 Differences in Attitudes Across Vulnerable Populations and PEH\\n\\nAttitudes of (Un)Deserv. (Solas, 2018) reflect comparisons between vulnerable populations and PEH as being more or less deserving of aid (Kiritchenko et al., 2023; Hoffmann, 2019) putting them at risk for being further ostracized from garnering public support for relief and reform measures (Lalor et al., 2022). We investigate the finer-grained differences in attitudes as characterized by the following subpopulations of PEH: veterans, people, immigrants, refugees, americans and the following vulnerable populations: asylum seekers, immigrants, refugees, illegal aliens, Ukrainians among the most frequently occurring bigrams in our data. We extract a subset of 153K posts (out of 2.4M posts) mentioning these terms. 'Homeless Veteran', 'Homeless People' and 'Homeless American' co-occur most frequently with 'Ukrainian' and 'Immigrant' (see Figure 13 in Appendix D). For each co-occurring (PEH, Vulnerable Population) pair, we examine the most statistically significant attitudes (see Table 11 in Appendix D). We find marked differences in attitudes when PEH are compared to Ukrainians versus when they are compared to immigrants. Public attitudes in posts that compare PEH with Ukrainians appear either as GovCrit. or appeals for MoneyAid. In contrast, posts comparing PEH to immigrants elicit more nationalistic sentiment and are oriented around relocation (NIMBY) and HarmGen.\\n\\n### 4.4 Tracking Attitudes Across Time\\n\\nGeo-political events serve as catalysts for reactive and inflammatory attitudes on social media. We find that the prevalence of certain attitudes across several months correlates with news cycles that dominated the discourse on homelessness. Figure 6 shows the frequency of attitudes by month across 2021 to 2023. We observe that GovCrit., SolnInt., (Un)Deserv., and MoneyAid. peaked in 12-2022, a time when tensions were rising in the U.S. due to Congress considering a spending bill with $44.9 billion in aid for Ukrainians during the Russian-Ukraine\"}"}

For example, the following post contains mentions of the spending bill followed by a comparison to the existing homelessness crisis in the country:\\n\\n\u201cThey just approved $45 Billion for Ukraine that\u2019ll be unaccounted for and to be spent however they please. We have homeless wandering the streets looking for a warm place to get out of the cold.\u201d\\n\\nAdditionally, we investigate the prevalence of attitudes in posts about New York and find that GovCrit. and (Un)Deserv. attitudes spike significantly between 01-29-2022 and 02-02-2022. The spike correlates to a $40M contract to convert the hotels into temporary housing for an influx of migrants (Zraick, 2023; Flanagan and Fomoso, 2023) leading to protests, increased hostility towards migrants and public opposition against the government. Such comparisons between immigrants and the state\u2019s homeless population resulted in a spike in (Un)Deserv. and GovCrit. attitudes.\\n\\n5 Conclusion and Future Work\\n\\nWe introduce OATH-Frames which characterize online attitudes towards homelessness under three overarching themes and nine Issue-specific frames. We annotate posts using Expert, GPT-4 and Expert+GPT-4 and use them to train a model to predict OATH-Frames on a large collection of 2.4M posts. We show that modeling OATH-Frames offers distinct advantages over existing models for toxicity and sentiment classification, and reveals nuanced attitudes in relation to states, marginalized populations, and over time.\\n\\nWe hope to expand OATH-Frames to include more context such as target groups, or correlated factors (e.g., substance use and mental illness). Our work serves as a blueprint for building frameworks that incorporate insights from social science experts for different large-scale socially sensitive annotation tasks. We expect OATH-Frames to serve as a tool for social science practitioners in analyzing attitudes towards complex social issues at scale.\\n\\nAcknowledgements\\n\\nWe would like to thank Julia Mendelsohn, Xuhui Zhou, Rob Voigt, Justin Cho, Marco Castro, Sun-young Lie, Aida Davani, and Vinodkumar Prabhakaran for their valuable insights on our framing typology and annotation pipeline.

LLMs have been shown to reflect biases (Feng et al., 2023; Gallegos et al., 2023) that are considered harmful to underserved communities (Kiritchenko et al., 2023). We are still understanding the capabilities of LLMs in contextualizing and reasoning about sensitive topics such as homelessness that are contingent on complex social and political norms. As a result, we ensure our annotations are validated by experts in social science to mitigate the propagation of harms reflected by LLMs. An interesting avenue for future work would be to more effectively scale up large scale annotations for socially sensitive settings by better allocating expert intervention where necessary.\\n\\nDiversity of Attitudes\\n\\nGiven that we do not know the demographic background or geographical origin of the post, our framing typology may not necessarily be representative of attitudes towards homelessness outside the U.S. Homelessness is viewed differently depending on regional-\"}"}
{"id": "emnlp-2024-main-724", "page_num": 10, "content": "{\"primary_language\":\"en\",\"is_rotation_valid\":true,\"rotation_correction\":0,\"is_table\":false,\"is_diagram\":false,\"natural_text\":\"ity, ideology, political and economic status among other socio-political factors that might not be represented in our dataset. Our framing typology may have introduced our own prior biases in reasoning about these posts that may not be in direct alignment with the general public's attitudes towards homelessness.\\n\\nThe use of LLMs could further exacerbate societal biases in reasoning about an already marginalized population. This is an important consideration while using OATH-Frames in making generalizations about attitudes towards homelessness.\\n\\nData Collection via Keyword Search\\n\\nOur collection of Twitter posts was restricted to those that contained the keyword 'homeless' but there are many other terms to reference PEH, which could be explored in future work.\\n\\nPrivacy\\n\\nDue to the diversity of our dataset and lexical diversity of social media posts, we anonymized user handles, and did not obtain or use any priors about the user from their profile or follower network; however, prior work has shown that demographic background could be useful (Tsai et al., 2019). We only rely on the content of the post and the timestamp (time at which the post was created) for our study.\\n\\nConfounders\\n\\nWe did not consider additional social, political and economic confounders that can point to why some attitudes are more salient than others. For example, substance use and mental illness may influence the public's opinion about PEH (Baiocchi and Arguello, 2019). OATH-Frames can serve as the foundation for identifying such factors which can further corroborate the statistical prevalence of certain attitudes over others. Furthermore, taking into consideration the target group of the post may provide more finer grained signals as to who the attitude is directed at and help better classify harmful rhetoric towards PEH (Kiritchenko et al., 2023). Initially, we considered the characterization of these additional factors which are shown in Figure 8, but it's extremely difficult and laborious to label posts at scale with more than 50+ frames and labels. We leave it up to future work to characterize additional social and political factors that can provide important and necessary context in elaborating the statistical prevalence of the frames in our dataset.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nJihan Abdalla. 2022.

Following the 'coding' process from grounded theory (Glaser and Strauss, 1967), we redefined our frames after consensus discussions. In our primary iterations, we also considered annotating factors that are often conflated with homelessness. Examples of such factors include substance use and mental illness. Such factors provide important context for how public opinion can be influenced by the social and economic climate of a particular region. We provide details of these factors in Figure 8 and leave this up to future work as an extension of OATH-Frames. In the following section, we outline our expert annotation OATH-Guidelines developed during Frame Discovery that contain clarifications of our definitions, common questions that came up during the annotation process and steps on how to address edge cases.

Prior studies have found that diversity in public attitudes towards homelessness are heavily influenced by personal experiences and socio-demographic backgrounds. More specifically, Tsai et al. (2019) conducted a survey of 541 U.S. adults on public attitudes about homelessness with the goal of determining socio-demographic characteristics of survey respondents that are associated with particular attitudes. They find that a majority of the participants who identified as female, lower income, Democrat and were personally exposed to homelessness expressed attitudes of compassion towards PEH and believed that the federal government should take more constructive measures in funding and reform policies for PEH. Similarly, Smith et al. (2023) and Mullenbach et al. (2023) study people's prior personal experiences with homelessness and its effect on attitudes and perceptions towards PEH. Prior studies also analyze how sociodemographic backgrounds of participants influence an individual's belief behind the cause of homelessness through surveys (Lee et al., 1990; Dittmeier et al., 2018; Agans and Liu, 2015; Hocking and Lawrence, 2000). Such studies on attitudes and perceptions towards PEH play an important role in influencing public policies that address homelessness and restrictive housing policies (Mullenbach et al., 2023; Link et al., 1995).\\n\\nPublic opinion is heavily influenced by the social and political climate. To this end, prior work have also looked at changing attitudes towards homelessness from 1990 to 2016 (Tsai et al., 2017) and 1993 to 2001 (Tompsett et al., 2006) by comparing survey responses conducted in different years and they found increasingly more liberal and compassionate responses towards homelessness. Beyond analyzing survey responses, Baiocchi and Arguello (2019) identifies a basic topology from ethnographic studies to identify key narratives in discourse about homelessness: sin-talk, sick-talk, and system-talk which characterize the causes of homelessness enlisting criminal behavior and mental illness as primary contributing factors. Although such studies provide invaluable insights into public opinion, it is extremely challenging to collect and analyze survey responses at a larger scale. Furthermore, prior work has also identified shortcomings in existing datasets and toxicity classifiers in recognizing degrading rhetoric against poor and disadvantaged populations. This is because harmful language against marginalized groups is often masked by humor and sarcasm and includes more subtle accounts of stereotyping that may be specific to a particular vulnerable population and thus harder to recognize (Kiritchenko et al., 2023; Curto et al., 2023). As a result, there exist few specialized datasets to study language targeted specifically towards PEH (Kiritchenko et al., 2023). To this end, we plan to expand on these studies by performing large-scale analyses on social media posts annotated with OATH-Frames and providing a data resource that analyzes complex, and at times, harmful attitudes against PEH.\\n\\nE.2 Quantifying Framing in Social Media Discourse.\\n\\nFraming (Entman, 1993) offers one mechanism to understand the communicative power of language by characterizing what people find most important in a text. Framing has been used to analyze the politics of homelessness and crime in New York City to characterize responses to homelessness (Upton, 2016). Furthermore, framing has also been used to study discourse on social media for topics such as immigration and politics (Mendelsohn et al., 2021; Boydstun and Gross, 2013). Our line of work is most similar to prior work that studies stigma and stereotypes against PEH in the media (Kim et al., 2023; Link et al., 1991; Leibowitz and Krueger, 2005; Belcher and DeForge, 2012). More specifically, Kim et al. (2023) characterize stigma against PEH using social media posts by manually annotating 6.4k posts and defining a set of codes that characterize different stigmatizing traits attributed to PEH. We build on prior work that use framing theory to surface issue-specific frames that characterize attitudes towards homelessness on social media and apply OATH-Frames to study attitudes at scale.\\n\\nE.3 LLMs as an Annotation Assistant.\\n\\nCollecting high quality annotations for socially complex, and sensitive tasks is not only a laborious and time consuming process, but also mentally...\"}"}

However, Pangakis et al. (2023) test the performance of GPT-4 across 27 annotation tasks and find that LLM performance varies widely across tasks and is largely dependent on the difficulty and subjectivity of the annotation task. They suggest evaluating generated annotations with a set of high quality expert annotations during prompt tuning. Furthermore, Rytting et al. (2023) experiment with GPT-3 as an annotator on its own and find that across four different tasks, GPT-3 performs more efficiently and as effectively as human annotators. For socially complex tasks such as homelessness, we use GPT-4 as an assistant in the annotation process while validating its predictions with human experts to leverage both the efficiency while also maintaining the quality of LLM generated annotations. It is important for us to validate GPT-4 predictions as LLMs have been shown to misrepresent identity groups which can cause downstream harms when reasoning about problems with sensitive social implications such as homelessness (Wang et al., 2024).\"}"}
