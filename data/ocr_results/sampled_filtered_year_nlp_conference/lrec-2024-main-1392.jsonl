In this paper, we describe ParCoLab, a parallel corpus and a web platform for querying the corpus. From its onset, ParCoLab has been geared towards lower-resource languages, with an initial corpus in Serbian, along with French and English (later Spanish). We focus here on the extension of ParCoLab with a parallel corpus for four regional languages of France: Alsatian, Corsican, Occitan and Poitevin-Saintongeais. In particular, we detail criteria for choosing texts and issues related to their collection. The new parallel corpus contains more than 20k tokens per regional language.\\n\\nKeywords: parallel corpora, low-resource languages, web interfaces\\n\\n1. Introduction and Objectives\\n\\nParallel corpora are not only a prerequisite for developing machine translation tools but also helpful resources for linguists as well as language learners, teachers lexicographers and translators. Yet, parallel corpora are scarce for most of the world's language pairs (Haddow et al., 2022). The situation is by no means different for regional languages of France. These languages are very poorly equipped with digital resources and tools, compared to French (Leixa et al., 2014). While the situation has somewhat improved in the last years thanks to several projects, the disparity between French and the other languages of France is still very important. Recently, Joshi et al. (2020) established a 6-level taxonomy \u2013from 0 to 5\u2013 of the world's languages based on the number of existing language resources: while French is classified at level 5 (best possible level, indicating a resource-rich language), Occitan and Corsican only make it to level 1, while Alsatian is still classified at level 0 (worst level).\\n\\nFor these languages, translations are usually available only as non-digitized books. Web crawling is not a relevant solution, since there is little to no use of these languages in the public space, including official web pages and documents. Moreover, web-crawled corpora, while sometimes including low-resource languages, are often of poor quality (Kreutzer et al., 2022; Kevers, 2022). Crowdsourced translations available e.g. in the Tatoeba collection are few in number: 13K sentences for Occitan, with only 24 sentences for Corsican.\\n\\nThe FLORES-200 (NLLB Team et al., 2022) test set for machine translation includes Occitan, Basque and Catalan, which are all three considered as regional languages of France, but none of the other 70+ regional languages of France.\\n\\nIn this paper, we focus on four regional languages of France and their integration into the ParCoLab parallel corpus and platform. From its onset, this resource and tool were geared towards lower-resource languages, with an initial corpus including texts in Serbian, along with French and English. The corpus has since been extended to Occitan with a pilot study in 2018 then to Spanish in 2020 and, since 2022, to three other regional languages of France: Alsatian, Corsican and Poitevin-Saintongeais.\\n\\n1. https://tatoeba.org/.\\n2.

Description of ParCoLab\\n\\nThe ParCoLab platform used in this work was established in 2015 with the financial support of the Research Valorisation Unit at the University of Toulouse Jean Jaur\u00e8s (Stosic et al., 2019). Its primary aim is to facilitate the web-based presentation and retrieval of texts from the underlying parallel corpus. As such, the ParCoLab platform functions as a searchable textual database, housing parallel texts in multiple languages. In the subsequent subsection (2.1), we provide a general presentation of the ParCoLab corpus, with a focus on the Serbian, French, English and Spanish languages. Section 2.2 introduces its contents, while in section 2.3, we delve into the query capabilities of the ParCoLab platform. Section 2.4 summarises the ongoing and prospective research endeavours.\\n\\n2.1. General Presentation\\n\\nThe development of the ParCoLab corpus began long before the platform was established, tracing its origins back to 2007 (Stosic et al., 2019). This corpus owes its creation to a fruitful collaborative effort involving the CLLE research unit (CNRS and the University of Toulouse-Jean Jaur\u00e8s, France), working in conjunction with the Department of Romance Studies at the Faculty of Philology, University of Belgrade in Serbia. The ParCoLab corpus initially comprised texts in French, Serbian, and English, providing support for these three languages within the ParCoLab platform (Miletic et al., 2017). Subsequently, between 2017 and 2018, the platform underwent significant enhancements, driven by a grant from the D\u00e9l\u00e9gation g\u00e9n\u00e9rale \u00e0 la langue fran\u00e7aise et aux langues de France (DGLFLF) under the French Ministry of Culture. These improvements were strategically aimed at expanding the platform\u2019s language coverage. Notably, in 2018, a pilot study was carried out to test the feasibility of extending the platform to regional languages by aligning existing texts with Occitan translations (Stosic and Bras, 2018; Bras, 2023). In 2020, Spanish was introduced into the corpus (Terzi\u0107 et al., 2020). Since 2022, the corpus has been enriched with texts in Alsatian, Corsican and Poitevin-Saintongeais, thanks to financial support from the French National Research Agency (ANR) granted to the DIVIT AL project. Section 3 details the process of adding regional languages of France to ParCoLab. The corpus database is hosted on the servers of the French Huma-Num consortium. It is not available for download but can be freely accessed through the user-friendly ParCoLab query platform at the following address: http://parcolab.univ-tlse2.fr/. The primary objective of the ParCoLab project is to create a high-quality and highly reliable multilingual parallel corpus (cf. Miletic et al. (2017); Marjanovi\u0107 et al. (2018); Stosic et al. (2019); Terzi\u0107 et al. (2020)). Its primary purpose is to be a valuable resource primarily used by human users. These users can employ it for developing theoretical language descriptions, particularly in the realm of contrastive linguistics and empirical research in translation studies (Miletic et al., 2017; Stosic et al., 2019). Simultaneously, the ParCoLab platform aims to serve as a practical tool for various translation tasks, language learning, educational language content creation, and the development of monolingual and bilingual dictionaries (cf. Marjanovi\u0107 et al. (2018)). At the beginning, it was especially useful for Serbian, a low-resource language, as it fostered the development of Natural Language Processing (NLP) resources (see Miletic et al. (2017); Miletic (2018)), which are also openly accessible to other researchers working with the Serbian language. Furthermore, although a secondary aim, the ParCoLab corpus has the potential for broader applications in the field of NLP. These include text...\"}"}

Content\\n\\nThe content of the ParCoLab parallel corpus is influenced by the initial language selection (Miletic et al., 2017; Stosic et al., 2019). A particular challenge arises when aligning texts in two widely spoken global languages, such as French and English, with texts in Serbian, a less commonly used language on the international stage. Serbian, despite being spoken in several countries, does not hold the status of an official language in major supra-national organizations like the European Union. Consequently, there is a limited pool of Serbian texts available that also have French and English versions. Thus, the primary consideration when selecting texts for alignment is their availability, as well as the quality of translation (Miletic et al., 2017). The initial phase focused exclusively on classical literary works with their high-quality translations (Marjanovi\u0107 et al., 2018; Stosic et al., 2019).\\n\\nThe alignment of the original texts with their translations is executed using an algorithm integrated into the ParCoLab platform, without the need for external resources (cf. Marjanovi\u0107 et al., 2018; Stosic et al., 2019). This algorithm follows a systematic approach, establishing one-to-one alignments initially at the chapter level, then progressing to the paragraph level, and ultimately fine-tuning at the sentence level. The ParCoLab editing platform offers the flexibility to align three languages simultaneously, allowing for language order adjustments. Any errors flagged by the tool are manually corrected, ensuring the utmost reliability of the corpus alignments.\\n\\nHowever, during the initial phase, older public domain literary works were primarily aligned, significantly influencing the linguistic composition of the ParCoLab corpus (Miletic et al., 2017; Marjanovi\u0107 et al., 2018; Stosic et al., 2019). This prompted a need for diversification. Despite some efforts made in this regard, literary works continued to dominate, constituting 88.7% of the corpus. In the second phase, the corpus was expanded, incorporating what is referred to as 'spoken language data' (Terzi\u0107 et al., 2020). Locating authentic spoken content in multiple languages, especially when considering Serbian, posed a challenge. To address this, a decision was made to include transcripts of TED talks with translations in the ParCoLab corpus. These talks offer accessible and diverse content. To account for potential\"}"}

They were manually transcribed and, given time and resource constraints, these transcripts cover fewer tokens than TED talks. This approach helped achieve a more balanced distribution of written and \u2018spoken\u2019 language data, standing at 55% and 45%, respectively. Starting from 2020, the textual database has seen an expansion with the inclusion of texts from diverse domains, leading to a resurgence of written texts (see Table 1).\\n\\nThe proportion of spoken language data has now decreased to 31% (cf. Terzi\u0107 et al. (2020)), with 29% of tokens originating from TED talks, and the remaining tokens corresponding to transcripts of films, cartoons, and simultaneous interpreting. Literary content continues to dominate, accounting for 44% of all tokens. Other newly added domains include journalism (12%), religion (6%), philosophy, sports and legislation (2% each), while all remaining categories (climatology, web content, politics, cinematography, biology) together constitute less than 5% of all tokens in the corpus. A detailed token distribution by language and text domains is shown in Figure 1.\\n\\n2.3. Querying Possibilities in ParCoLab\\n\\nQueries are carried out using a user-friendly interface that is both visually intuitive and functionally straightforward (cf. Marjanovi\u0107 et al. (2018); Stosic et al. (2019)). This interface is powered by the ElasticSearch search engine, which is well-adapted for querying data in NoSQL databases. It offers versatile querying options, enabling users to perform single-language or multi-language queries involving up to three languages at once. Irrespective of the query\u2019s complexity, results are always presented in parallel across three languages. Users can formulate queries for individual words, multi-word expressions, phrases with one or more wildcard characters, words that start or end with specific character sequences etc. Additionally, the interface supports the use of regular expressions and Boolean operators.\\n\\nAll texts are stored in XML format files in accordance with TEI P5 guidelines (TEI Consortium, 2023) (cf. (Miletic et al., 2017; Marjanovi\u0107 et al., 2018; Stosic et al., 2019)). These XML files contain standardized metadata, including title, subtitle, author, translator, publisher, publication place and date, creation date, source, language of the text, language of the original work, domain, text genre and form, token count, and more. This extensive pool of metadata confers upon users the capability to construct finely-tuned queries based on specific metadata criteria. Notably, the interface currently affords users the option to tailor their searches by selecting the source language, constraining queries to particular authors, specific works, or textual domains, thus offering the possibility to choose the subcorpus they want to work on.\\n\\nAdditionally, a subset, though relatively small, of the corpus boasts multiple layers of annotation, including lemmas, parts of speech (POS), morphosyntactic descriptions (MSDs), and syntactic relations (Miletic et al., 2017; Stosic et al., 2019). This applies to a novel with a total of 233K tokens in English, which is complemented by French and Serbian translations, a Serbian literary ParCoTrain-Synt subcorpus comprising approximately 150K tokens (Miletic, 2018), and a compact ParCoJour corpus of news texts in Serbian (Terzi\u0107, 2019). These texts serve as valuable resources for both training and evaluating tools dedicated to text annotation in Serbian. The annotation process was conducted using the French Treebank for French (Abeill\u00e9 et al., 2003), the Penn Treebank for English (Marcus et al., 1993), and the Serbian Treebank for Serbian (Miletic, 2018).\\n\\nWithin the query interface, users have the possibility to explore annotated texts by transitioning from the Expression query mode to the Feature mode (Stosic et al., 2019). In Feature mode, queries extend beyond specific word forms and can encompass lemmas, POS, MSDs, and syntactic relations within sentences. To streamline Feature mode queries, users can select the appropriate POS from a dropdown menu, with the interface offering corresponding MSDs and syntactic relations based on the chosen POS. An illustrative representation of the query interface is presented in Figure 2.\\n\\n2.4. Ongoing Work\\n\\nSince 2007, this ongoing project has aimed to enhance the ParCoLab database and platform both qualitatively and quantitatively. Firstly, efforts are being made to achieve a balanced representation of languages within the database. This involves the inclusion of translated texts for languages that were previously underrepresented. Simultaneously, ongoing work is focused on ensuring that all languages are more comprehensively represented with original texts and an increased incorporation of translations of these original texts. This expanded scope aims to facilitate cross-lingual searches to a greater extent.\\n\\nSecondly, the diversification of the textual database remains a priority. In the near future, there are plans to introduce aligned texts of inter-\"}"}

We then present a parallel corpus in four regional languages plus French (section 3.2). We detail the inclusion criteria for the texts to be collected in Section 3.2.1. The text collection process is described in Section 3.2.2. Finally, we describe the alignment process in Section 3.2.3 and we detail the contents of the regional corpora in Section 3.2.4.\\n\\n#### 3.1. Hosting Regional Languages\\n\\nThe ParCoLab platform hosts four different regional languages of France along three configurations:\\n\\n1. The language already has its own textual database gathering texts originally written in this language: the platform offers a nice solution to provide access to these texts in other languages. For example, this is the case for the literary work of the Occitan author Joan Bodon: his Occitan texts are part of the Occitan text database BaT el\u00d2c while these texts aligned with their French translation are displayed in ParCoLab, in a complementary strategy;\\n\\n2. The language does not have a textual database yet: ParCoLab offers a ready to use solution to provide access to the texts written in this language, be they aligned with translations or not; this is the case for Poitevin-Saintongeais, for which a great deal of texts were gathered in the aim of building a text database, (TELPOS project by Liliane Jagueneau), or for Alsatian;\\n\\n3. There exist translations in regional languages of widespread texts (international literature works from Kipling, Stevenson, Doyle, Saint-Exup\u00e9ry, Giono, for example, or international conventions): here again ParColab offers a nice solution to provide access to these translations in less spread languages.\\n\\n#### Table 2\\n\\n| Language          | Number of Tokens in French | Number of Tokens in English | Number of Tokens in Occitan | Number of Tokens in Poitevin-Saintongeais |\\n|-------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------|\\n| Original Texts    |                           |                             |                             |                                         |\\n| French            | 12345                     | 67890                       | 11223                       | 45678                                    |\\n| English           | 12345                     |                             | 11223                       |                                         |\\n| Occitan           | 12345                     |                             |                             | 45678                                    |\\n| Poitevin-Saintongeais | 12345                   |                             |                             | 45678                                    |\\n\\n9 [http://redac.univ-tlse2.fr/bateloc/]\"}"}

PoitSaint corresponds to Poitevin-Saintongeais.\\n\\nThe table shows that, for Poitevin-Saintongeais, ParCoLab hosts a majority of monolingual, non-translated yet, documents (see Configuration 2 above), whereas all the Occitan texts in ParCoLab are associated with at least one translation in another language (see Configuration 1 above).\\n\\n3.2. A Four Regional Language Parallel Corpus\\n\\nIn this section, we present our parallel corpus in four regional languages of France, Alsatian, Corsican, Occitan and Poitevin-Saintongeais, plus French, that belongs to the third configuration mentioned in section 3.1. This corpus, named the \\\"DIVIT AL parallel corpus\\\", represents a joint effort to improve the visibility of these languages and to offer the possibility to compare them with other languages for cross-linguistic investigations. This corpus is unique, in the sense that very few texts are available in all four languages, with bilingual French-regional language texts being much more common. It follows the long established tradition of collecting translations of the same story in several languages and dialects. Moreover, this contributes to promoting France's written and literary heritage in languages other than French.\\n\\n3.2.1. Survey and Inclusion Criteria\\n\\nAs a first step, we carried out a survey of texts translated from or to our target languages. During this survey, we assessed the following desired properties:\\n\\n1. Availability of translations in at least two of the target regional languages and/or several languages. For instance, *Le Petit Prince* (The Little Prince) by Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry is one of the most translated texts in the world, with 462 translations listed on the [http://www.petit-prince.at/](http://www.petit-prince.at/) website.\\n\\n2. Copyright status, to ensure open access (Collister, 2022).\\n\\n3. Level of difficulty in translating the text to other languages.\\n\\n4. Possible use for manual annotation in parts-of-speech and dependency relationships, which will be done in a second phase of the project.\\n\\n5. Relevance of the contents to contemporary issues, e.g., the environment, human rights, status of regional languages. For instance, *L'homme qui plantait des arbres* (The Man Who Planted Trees) by Jean Giono conveys ecological and humanist messages that are very modern.\\n\\n6. Reusability of content in pedagogical contexts, e.g. *The Little Prince* can be used in schools for language comparison activities.\\n\\n7. Use in existing dialectal language documentation works, e.g. *The Parable of the Prodigal Son* (Coquebert de Montbret and de Labouderie, 1831; Favre, 1879), *The Decameron* (Papanti, 1875) or *The North Wind and the Sun* (de Mare\u00fcil et al., 2018).\\n\\nThe decision for inclusion in the final corpus was based on a combination of these criteria and was discussed between the project's participants.\\n\\n3.2.2. Text Collection and Translation\\n\\nOnce we had identified the texts we wished to include in our corpus (see Table 3), we collected the translations. We distinguish between three different cases:\\n\\n1. Texts in the public domain: these texts can be directly included in our corpus.\\n\\n2. Existing published translations: in this case, we strive to make agreements with publishers. In the case of difficulties in identifying the copyright holders or publishing house and negotiating with them, we display only limited contexts in ParCoLab, in accordance with the right to quote.\\n\\n3. Texts with no translation in some or all of the target languages: these texts are translated specifically for the project, with a transfer of property rights from the translator, either by members of the project (co-authors of this paper) or by external translators. For some of the languages, recruiting translators can be difficult: this is particularly the case for following Directive 2019/790 of the European Parliament and the Council of 17 April 2019 on copyright and related rights in the Digital Single Market, amending Directives 96/9/EC and 2001/29/EC, and Article L122-5 of the French Intellectual Property Code, we only use these texts for text and data mining within scientific research projects.\"}"}

In this language, we rely on regional language clubs, whose members are particularly committed to initiatives like ours, which help to keep their language alive and promote it.\\n\\nThe issues mentioned make it difficult to collect some of the texts and result in lengthy delays (negotiations, contacts with publishers and translators, translation delivery time). Translations available only in printed form have to be digitised and OCRised. This is no research work per se, but is nevertheless mandatory to obtain resources which can be exploited. In addition to the time-consuming labour associated with these tasks, expenses are necessary for the payment of translators.\\n\\n3.2.3. Alignment\\n\\nAlignments are performed using the sentence alignment tool available within ParCoLab (see Section 2.2). All the alignments are manually checked and corrected after initial automatic processing, which identifies the document structure (chapter, section...) and segments it into sentences. Some texts are also aligned outside of the ParCoLab platform, using standalone sentence alignment tools. In particular, we use the InterText tool (Vondricka, 2014) which provides an interface to align documents and correct the resulting alignment. These are then automatically transformed to the TEI XML format suitable for ParCoLab using custom Python scripts.\"}"}

Corpus Details\\n\\nPlanned corpus contents for the DIVIT AL parallel corpus are detailed in Table 3: the corpora are complete for Alsatian, Occitan and French. Corpus acquisition is still ongoing for Corsican and Poitevin-Saintongeais, but several texts listed in Table 3 are already available on ParCoLab. The texts listed in Table 3 are, for the time being, essentially limited to the literary domain, with one legal text, one religious text and some newspaper chronicles (see Figure 3). With 20k tokens per language, including French, we will provide a new 100k token five-lingual parallel corpus.\\n\\n4. Conclusion and Perspectives\\n\\nWe have presented the ParCoLab corpus: originally comprising texts in Serbian, French and English, and later, Occitan, then Spanish, it is currently being extended with translations for three other regional languages of France. The associated online web platform provides a user-friendly interface for accessing the corpus and carrying out complex queries. It makes the corpus easily usable by language professionals and learners.\\n\\nCollecting corpora for Alsatian, Corsican, Occitan and Poitevin-Saintongeais is however a time and money consuming process, given the lack of easily accessible digital resources. Whenever possible, we strive to collect texts which can be freely shared under the principles of open science, so as to foster further research. In particular, the corpus can be used to develop NLP tools (machine translation) and resources (multilingual lexicons). The alignment to higher-resource languages such as French or English can be useful for annotation projection across languages (Agi\u0107 et al., 2016; Akbik and Vollgraf, 2018).\\n\\nIn the future, we plan to manually annotate parts of the regional language texts following the Universal Dependencies (UD) framework (Nivre et al., 2016). This will provide additional layers of annotations for querying the corpus in the platform and performing contrastive linguistics studies.\\n\\n5. Limitations\\n\\n(1) The corpus collected so far for regional languages of France lacks diversity with respect to some criteria: author gender, representation of language variants, genres, time periods, source language. (2) Some of the texts included in the corpus are still under copyright and are not shareable: these texts are only made available through the ParCoLab platform, with a limitation in the size of the viewable context, under the principles of Fair Use.\\n\\n6. Ethics Statement\\n\\nThe professional translators were paid in accordance to current rates for translations in France.\\n\\n7.
