The FAIR principles were introduced as a guide to good open data practices and they have since been complemented by the CARE principles for indigenous data governance. This article describes how the DGS Corpus implemented these principles and how the two sets of principles affected each other. The DGS Corpus is a large collection of recordings of members of the deaf community in Germany communicating in their primary language, German Sign Language (DGS); it was created to be both as a resource for linguistic research and as a record of the life experiences of deaf people in Germany. The corpus was designed with CARE in mind to respect and empower the language community and FAIR data publishing was used to enhance its usefulness as a scientific resource.\\n\\nKeywords: FAIR principles, CARE principles, Linguistic Corpus, German Sign Language\\n\\n1. Introduction\\n\\nWhen creating resources relating to minority groups the aims of open science and open data must be balanced against the needs and rights of the minority group. The FAIR principles (Wilkinson et al., 2016) are designed as a guide to good open data practices, but do not take into account the needs of minority groups. The CARE principles (RDA International Indigenous Data Sovereignty IG, 2019) have been introduced as a complementary guide to ensuring that data is not only open, but also respects indigenous and minority group stakeholders. In many aspects CARE principles can be used to guide how FAIRness can be implemented. In other aspects, CARE helps identify how openness of data should be limited or adjusted to protect and empower the language community.\\n\\nIn this article we discuss how the CARE and FAIR principles have affected the creation and publication of the DGS Corpus, one of the largest signed language corpora available as of early 2022. The DGS Corpus is a collection of recordings of German Sign Language (DGS; Deutsche Geb\u00e4rdensprache) as used by members of its language community.\\n\\nThe primary stakeholders in the DGS language community are members of the deaf community in Germany. Their life experience differs distinctly from that of the majority population in a variety of factors, such as language barriers, accessibility of public services, medical treatment and education, personal identity and deaf-centric aspects of social life. As such they are a minority group in both a cultural and linguistic context. Consequently, CARE principles had to be a central tenet of the DGS Corpus creation process to ensure that it would contribute to the representation and empowerment of its community and avoid harm and exploitative practices.\\n\\nFAIR, like CARE, represents a set of guiding principles, not a fixed set of steps and technologies to use. As such, strategies had to be developed for how to best publish a linguistic dataset as large and complex as the DGS Corpus in a FAIR manner so that it would actually improve it. These strategies cover technical decisions, such as how to allow the persistent referencing of individual parts of the data, but also how FAIR can actively be used to support CARE, e.g. by providing open data in ways that benefit the community.\\n\\nThe remainder of this article is structured as follows: Section 2 describes the basic components of the FAIR and CARE principles and Section 3 provides a general introduction to the DGS Corpus. Section 4 then describes how various decisions during the creation and publication of the corpus were influenced by the considerations underlying CARE. These form the basis for how FAIRness in the resulting datasets can be implemented, which is described in Section 5. Section 6 provides a concluding summary and outlines potential future steps for improving the CARE and FAIRness of the corpus further.\\n\\n2. Background\\n\\n2.1. The FAIR Principles\\n\\nThe FAIR guiding principles (Wilkinson et al., 2016) stipulate that good data should be Findable. Data should be easy to find for both humans and machines. This requires globally unique and persistent identifiers which are indexed in searchable resources and associated with rich metadata.\\n\\nAccessible\\nUsers need to know how to access (meta)data, possibly including steps for authentication and authorisation. Access should be de-\"}"}

Even when data is no longer available, its metadata should be.\\n\\nInteroperable\\nData usually needs to be integrated with other data and interoperate with applications for analysis, storage and processing. (Meta)data should use well-defined knowledge representation formalisms, open controlled vocabularies and include qualified references to other (meta)data.\\n\\nReusable\\nData and metadata should be well-described so they can be re-used in different settings. They should have a clear license, detailed provenance information and meet domain-relevant community standards.\\n\\nEach of the four FAIR principles is further divided into a number of aspects that contribute to it. To fulfil the FAIR principles, data should be implemented in ways that make it both human- and machine-readable. For a more detailed description of the FAIR principles, see Wilkinson et al. (2016) and the GO FAIR website.\\n\\nWhile they are related to the open data movement, the FAIR principles acknowledge that there are legitimate reasons to restrict access to some kinds of data, so data can be FAIR without having to be open (Mons et al., 2017).\\n\\n2.2. The CARE Principles\\nWhile open data and FAIR focus on increasing the sharing of data, they do not address how such practices can be ethically implemented when the data in question originates within minority groups.\\n\\nThe CARE Principles for Indigenous Data Governance (RDA International Indigenous Data Sovereignty IG, 2019) were introduced to fill this gap, working as a response and complement to FAIR and as a counterbalance to open data requirements.\\n\\nThe CARE principles stipulate that the following should be observed:\\n\\nCollective Benefit\\nData ecosystems shall be designed and function in ways that enable Indigenous Peoples to derive benefit from the data.\\n\\nAuthority to Control\\nIndigenous Peoples' rights and interests in Indigenous data must be recognised and their authority to control such data be empowered.\\n\\nResponsibility\\nThose working with Indigenous data have a responsibility to share how this data is used to support Indigenous Peoples' self-determination and collective benefit.\\n\\nEthics\\nIndigenous Peoples' rights and wellbeing should be the primary concern at all stages of the data life cycle and across the data ecosystem.\\n\\nAs with FAIR, each CARE principle is subdivided further into concrete aspects. For detailed information on these, see the CARE website.\\n\\nWhile the CARE principles were designed with a focus on indigenous populations, they are also largely applicable to minority populations such as deaf communities (Batterbury et al., 2007; Bone et al., 2021).\\n\\n3. The DGS Corpus\\nThe DGS Corpus is a part of the DGS-Korpus project, which is a long-term project to create both a corpus and dictionary of German Sign Language (Prillwitz et al., 2008). It was started in 2009 and has a runtime of 15 years. Its goals are the creation of a reference corpus (the DGS Corpus), the release of a public subset of this corpus with high quality annotations (the Public DGS Corpus) and the creation of a corpus-based dictionary (DW-DGS \u2014 Digital Dictionary of German Sign Language). This article focuses on the first two goals and does not further address the corpus-based dictionary, which is at a preliminary stage at the time of writing.\\n\\n3.1. The Reference Corpus\\nThe DGS Corpus is a reference corpus that consists of 560 hours of conversations in DGS. It involves 330 participants from all parts of Germany. They were grouped in pairs and provided with a number of conversational tasks, such as discussing a given topic or historical event, free dialogue or the retelling of stories (Nishio et al., 2010). Recordings were made between 2010 and 2012 and everyone present during recording sessions (including moderators and technical personnel) used DGS as their primary language. For more information on the curation and demographic of the corpus, see Schulder et al. (2021).\\n\\nTo open up the recordings to linguistic research, gloss annotations and translations into German and English are being made. Creating annotations for signed languages is an elaborate process that requires considerable work. While significant parts of the corpus have already been transcribed, the work is still ongoing and is not expected to be fully concluded by the end of the project.\\n\\nAccess to the full reference corpus is restricted, requiring a licence agreement that is contingent on an evaluation of the intended use case (see Section 4.5). However, part of the corpus is made publicly available. This public component is described in the following section.\\n\\nSigned languages usually have no written form, so their linguistic annotation relies on glosses. These usually consist of a spoken language word that represents an approximate lexical translation, an index to disambiguate distinct signs that received the same gloss word, and sometimes additional information. Glosses are metalinguistic labels, they do not encode all nuances of an utterance and are not context-appropriate translations.\"}"}

The Public Corpus\\n\\nThe Public DGS Corpus is a publicly released subset of the reference corpus. It covers 50 hours of recordings and is fully annotated and translated. Its contents have been selected to both be interesting to a general audience and to give an impression of the different elicitation tasks that comprise the reference corpus. The annotations and translations have undergone additional quality assurance steps (Konrad et al., 2020) and personal information of participants and third parties has been anonymised (Bleicken et al., 2016).\\n\\nThe Public DGS Corpus was first released in 2018 (Jahn et al., 2018) and has since been updated with additional content and features about once a year (Hanke et al., 2020). It is published in two forms, My DGS and My DGS \u2013 annotated, which differ in what information is provided and how it is presented. Each can be reached through its own website.\\n\\nMy DGS (Hanke et al., 2018) is a community portal for the deaf community, DGS teachers and others interested in DGS. Its videos can be viewed online and are searchable by topic, conversation format, region and participant age group. Optional German subtitles are available.\\n\\nMy DGS \u2013 annotated (Konrad et al., 2018), a research portal for the international scientific community. It provides a fully annotated corpus of DGS including translations, body pose data for automated processing, and metadata. Its data can be downloaded or displayed in an online annotation viewer. The web portal, annotations and translations are all available in both English and German.\\n\\nApart from providing access to the transcripts of individual recordings, the research portal also includes a type index. The index lists the type glosses for all signs encountered in the corpus, including how often each one occurs. For each type it leads to a page that lists all their token occurrences, showing their immediate context (associated utterance translation and neighbouring glosses). The page also specifies the citation form of the sign via a studio recording (where available) and phonetic transcription using HamNoSys (Hanke, 2004), and provides links to other lexical resources that describe the same sign (M\u00fcller et al., 2020).\\n\\n4. CARE in the DGS Corpus\\n\\nAlthough the CARE principles themselves were only published in 2019, ten years after the start of this corpus project, the underlying discourse on research ethics that would eventually result in it was already present, regarding both indigenous and deaf populations (Harris et al., 2009; Linguistic Society of America, 2009).\\n\\nWhile the FAIR principles regard the publication of data and consequently mostly affect the final stages of the data creation cycle, CARE affects all stages of data creation and must be taken into account from the very start. In this section we outline how CARE affected the data collection phase (Section 4.1), the handling of informed consent (Section 4.2), in what forms data is presented to the public (Section 4.3), considerations on personal privacy and authorship (Section 4.4), public access and licensing (Section 4.5), and what amount of data could be released as part of the public corpus (Section 4.6).\\n\\nFor further details on the design and curation of both reference and public corpus, see also Schulder et al. (2021).\\n\\n4.1. Data Collection\\n\\nThe DGS-Korpus project was designed from the ground up with the needs and rights of the German deaf community (the primary stakeholders within the DGS language community) in mind. Following the principle \u201cnothing about us without us\u201d, the project has always included several deaf team members. In addition, a focus group of deaf users was formed to guide project decisions. Project and focus group members also regularly participate in deaf-centric events to inform the community about the progress of the project and collect feedback.\\n\\nTo ensure collective benefit, the corpus was designed so that its content would function both as a source for linguistic research and as a record of deaf culture. Through a variety of elicitation tasks, participants were encouraged to share their general life experience, deaf-specific experiences (e.g. schooling and deaf clubs), their perception of specific historical events, tell jokes, etc. (Nishio et al., 2010). Tasks and topics were chosen to be of interest to the deaf communities, so that the resulting resource would be entertaining, informative and support the identity of the community. (Blanck et al., 2010)\\n\\n4.2. Informed Consent\\n\\nAs a basis to authority to control, informed consent was requested from all corpus participants (Hanke et al., 2010). The consent process involved information about the purpose of the project, the collection, use and sharing of data, and the participant's rights. All information was provided in both DGS (video) and German (text). Participants received the opportunity to ask clarifying questions. Consent was then received as a recorded utterance in DGS and via signature.\\n\\nThe provided consent allows the use of the recorded data by the project. Regarding the sharing of data with third parties, participants could choose to opt out, choose on a case by case basis or delegate the decision to the project. This decision could be made separately for the sharing of data for non-commercial purposes of\"}"}

After recordings were concluded, participants were sent copies to review. They were given the opportunity to give or withhold approval and to identify specific sections that they would like excluded. This resulted in 60 exclusions of a few seconds or minutes, totalling 48 minutes \u2013 only 0.1 percent of recorded material \u2013 and no general exclusions. For details, see Hanke et al. (2010).\\n\\nFurthermore, participants were informed that they retain permanent legal control over their recordings and are free to request the removal of recordings at any time. As of the time of writing, no requests have been made.\\n\\n4.3. Data Presentation\\n\\nAs mentioned in Section 4.1, the DGS corpus is both a linguistic dataset and a record of deaf culture. To ensure that both these goals would be met by the public corpus and maximise the collective benefit it provided, it was decided to create two independent portals (see Section 3.2), each optimised for one of its two goals. The portal My DGS was designed with the deaf community as its primary user group in mind and DGS teachers and people generally interested in DGS and deaf culture as secondary user groups (Jahn et al., 2018). This involved focusing navigation on user interests, such as finding conversations about specific topics or by geographic region.\\n\\nAs DGS was the primary user language, German was used only where textual elements could not be avoided. The only longer description, an introduction to the project, was provided in both DGS and German. For the recordings, optional German subtitles are provided. The exception are recordings in which participants were asked to tell jokes. These are not subtitled, as spoken language translations were found to not capture their humour sufficiently.\\n\\nSome data was omitted as it was considered to not be interesting to a non-scientific audience, such as the gloss annotations and certain recordings that covered research-focused tasks, such as the retelling of picture stories commonly used in linguistic data collections.\\n\\nA preliminary version of the community portal with limited data was released in late 2015 to receive feedback from the deaf community and improve its features for the first release of the full dataset in 2018. Further feedback since then has resulted in additional changes. For example, the interface of the research portal, My DGS \u2013 annotated, was originally only made available in English, as its target audience was the international research community. Following interest from the general deaf community to inspect the research aspects of the corpus as well, a German interface was added.\\n\\n4.4. Privacy and authorship\\n\\nIn Germany, personal privacy is considered an important right. While the nature of the DGS corpus entails that participants can not have full anonymity as they are shown on video and asked to talk about personal experiences, the project deemed it important to protect their privacy and that of third parties as far as possible in the interest of minimising harm.\\n\\nIn all recordings, personally identifiable information (such as names, dates of birth or places of residence with small populations) of anyone not considered a public figure in the general or deaf population was removed. This anonymisation process affects videos, annotations, translations and pose information. (Bleicken et al., 2016; Isard, 2020).\\n\\nBoth the reference and public corpora are designed to provide a diverse and balanced selection of signers from different regions, ages and genders. In the public corpus, all recordings provide metadata to identify these factors, but to protect participant privacy, region and age are simplified to broad categories. Other recorded metadata, such as educational background and age of language acquisition, are not made public.\\n\\nAnother requirement of CARE is to establish provenance, i.e. where data originated. While the privacy considerations of the public corpus obfuscate that information, it can be clearly reconstructed through the restricted-access records of the reference corpus, in which each recording is associated with the identity and contact information of its participants. This way, authorship can be established at any time.\\n\\n4.5. Access and Licensing\\n\\nWhen choosing a licence for the Public DGS Corpus, CARE responsibilities had a strong impact on how open data conditions could be achieved. While commonly used open licences, such as those by Creative Commons, would allow open access and thus fulfil FAIR requirements, they were deemed too permissive to ensure the responsible and ethical use of the public corpus. Instead, custom licence conditions were developed.\\n\\nEach portal received a separate licence that reflects its intended uses. The community portal My DGS may be viewed for private and non-commercial purposes. The downloading of contents and integration into other services is limited to teaching purposes. Data from the research portal My DGS \u2013 annotated may only be used for linguistic research. To prevent the exploitation of its participants, commercial use of the corpus is not permitted. The limitation of research uses to linguistics was chosen to protect against data being used in contexts not related to DGS and deaf culture, such as general purpose image recognition, or in applications that might pose harm to individuals or the community.\\n\\nTo use the public corpus for applications not covered by its public licences (e.g. for other research area) or to a...\"}"}

Such agreements are negotiated on a per-case basis and contingent on evaluation of their collective benefit and ethics. If use case is not covered by the consent provided by participants, additional consent has to be requested.\\n\\n4.6 Size of Public Corpus\\n\\nFor a recording to be publishable in the public corpus, its translation and annotation must be complete and of sufficient quality. Personally identifiable information must be anonymised (see Section 4.4). Processing one hour of corpus recording to meet these standards requires about 800 to 1000 work hours. This puts hard constraints on how much of the reference corpus could be included in the public corpus.\\n\\nQuality assurance procedures for translation and annotation are interconnected. Translations of all corpus recordings were created early in the project to function as an additional aid to annotators. At the same time, the annotation process is used to highlight mistranslations. This is more efficient than running an independent verification of all translations. As flawed translations can potentially reflect badly on a participant by misrepresenting their views, quality assurance is an important part of CARE responsibility.\\n\\nAny recording that touches upon the private lives of the participants must be sufficiently anonymised. As the DGS Corpus has a strong focus on open conversations and the discussion of life experiences, this affects it more strongly than it does corpora which focus on linguist tasks that do not touch on the personal lives of participants. To identify which utterances require anonymisation, the project relies on translations and annotations (see Bleicken et al. (2016)).\\n\\nFrom these constraints follows a hierarchy of minimum workload for the publication of different parts of the corpus. For any task involving personal experiences (the majority of recordings) full annotation, translation and anonymisation is required. Anonymisation can be skipped for tasks revolving around entirely fictional contents, such as jokes and the retelling of narratives that were provided by the project. In the case of jokes it was also determined that they could still provide value without annotation and translation.\\n\\nFor narrative retellings and similar research-oriented tasks, the decision whether to invest in publishable annotations and translation was less straightforward. Originally it was decided that such recordings would not be useful enough to researchers without annotation, so only fully annotated recordings were included. This decision has been revisited recently, in part because the automatically generated pose information that was added to the corpus in releases 2 and 3 may in some cases work as a stand-in for missing annotations. Accordingly, additional recordings without annotation or translation will be published in the upcoming fourth release of the public corpus.\\n\\n5. A FAIR DGS Corpus\\n\\nReleasing a subset of the DGS Corpus publicly was part of the project plan from the beginning (Prillwitz et al., 2008). The expectation of what exactly such a public release should entail developed over the years as best practices in scientific data publishing evolved. An important milestone in this evolution were the FAIR principles introduced in 2016.\\n\\nThe FAIR principles are guidelines that describe what conditions should be met to create good scientific datasets, but they do not specify how exactly these conditions should be fulfilled. This is by design, as appropriate solutions depend on the nature of the dataset, the best practices of a scientific field and the technical solutions available at the given time.\\n\\nThis section describes how the DGS Corpus implements the FAIR principles. As a large linguistic corpus published as two separate but related datasets, the public corpus requires a complex structure of interconnected persistent identifiers (Section 5.1). Extensive metadata is provided, both relating to the description of data in general and linguistic data in particular (Section 5.2). The original full recordings of the reference corpus, while restricted access, are also equipped with identifiers and metadata and put in relation with the data of the public corpus (Section 5.3). Finally, the documentation of the reference and public corpus is published in a FAIR manner to support the data (Section 5.4).\\n\\n5.1 Persistent Identifiers for the Public Corpus\\n\\nThe most fundamental requirement of FAIR is to provide a dataset with a persistent identifier to ensure it is always findable in the same way. For small static datasets this can be a single identifier. For larger and more complex datasets that get updated over time, it is advisable to also provide a set of interlinked identifiers. This allows users to specify exactly which part and version of a dataset they are referencing.\\n\\nThe DGS Corpus uses Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs), one of the most commonly used persistent identifiers for digital data. DOIs are centrally registered and can be provided in the form of a URL. Following such a DOI URL then forwards the user to the current location of the dataset. This is more persistent than providing the direct URL of the current location, as it can easily be updated in case the location (and therefore the direct URL) changes. In addition, it can be used to explicitly associate metadata with the object that the DOI represents (see Section 5.2).\\n\\nEach DOI in the Public DGS Corpus is used to uniquely identify a specific component. This can be the whole dataset (Section 5.1.1), a specific recording transcript (Section 5.1.2) or a particular sign type (Section 5.1.3). To differentiate between different releases of the same component, a set of versioned DOIs is registered for each component (Section 5.1.4).\"}"}
{"id": "lrec-2022-1-18", "page_num": 6, "content": "{\"primary_language\":\"en\",\"is_rotation_valid\":true,\"rotation_correction\":0,\"is_table\":false,\"is_diagram\":false,\"natural_text\":\"5.1.1. Dataset\\nAs mentioned in Section 3.2 the Public DGS Corpus is published as in two forms: Meine DGS and Meine DGS \u2013 annotated. These are treated as distinct datasets that are related but distinct from one another. As such, each dataset receives its own set of DOIs. This involves DOIs representing the dataset as a whole as well as DOIs representing individual components (described in Sections 5.1.2 and 5.1.3).\\n\\n5.1.2. Transcript\\nThe public corpus is separated into individual transcripts. Each transcript represents a single elicitation task from a specific recording session between two participants. The transcript consists of the video recording, its annotation and translations, and other associated data, such as pose information and metadata files. Each transcript has its own set of DOIs to allow users to reference particular discourses.\\n\\n5.1.3. Sign Type\\nThe type index of the research portal (see Section 3.2) provides an alternative way of viewing the dataset from the perspective of individual signs and their distribution across the dataset. Each sign type entry receives its own set of DOIs.\\n\\nThis is the most unusual kind of DOI in the corpus, as it references a conceptual entity rather than one that follows from the primary data structure. Sign type DOIs are included to support researchers who wish to refer to specific signs in their research. This can for example be useful for corpus analyses focusing on particular signs, cases where it would be impractical to reference all relevant transcript locations in which a sign occurs, or for researchers that use the type index as a lexical resource, referring to the sign in general, rather than to a specific instance in the corpus. Identifying sign types by DOI also helps provide persistence when the gloss of a sign type changes. While this does not happen often, it may occasionally be the case when the spoken language part of a gloss is found to be erroneous or insufficient in some way. In such cases, the type DOI will still correctly refer to the same sign, as it represents the sign language sign, not the spoken language gloss.\\n\\n5.1.4. Version\\nSince its original release in 2018 the public corpus has been regularly updated and extended (Hanke et al., 2020). The data of each individual release is frozen and does not change anymore. While the main URLs of the portals always refer to the latest release, old releases are still accessible.\\n\\nNew DOIs are created for each release of the corpus to allow users to clearly specify which release they are referring to, e.g. to ensure the replicability of their research. Each DOI is intended as a unique identifier of an object, so only if the object in question has changed between versions is a new DOI assigned, otherwise the object and its DOI are understood to be equally related to multiple corpus releases. A transcript is receives a new DOI if at least one of its files is changed, for example due to corrections in the annotation or updates to its pose information. Similarly, sign types receive a new DOI if their set of token instances changes (due to corrections or new data) or other information such as the gloss or HamNoSys transcription is updated. In the case of DOIs for the complete My DGS and My DGS \u2013 annotated datasets, a new DOI is assigned for each release, as a new release will by definition include changes to the dataset.\\n\\nIn addition to the release-specific DOIs described so far, so called Version DOIs, all corpus objects also receive a Concept DOI. This is a DOI that refers to the object without specifying which version is meant. While for most cases a Version DOI should be used to be as specific as possible, in some cases it is preferable to clearly state that the object is referred to in general or that the most recent available version should be used.\\n\\n5.2. Metadata for the Public Corpus\\nMetadata is provided through two mechanisms: DOI metadata for general purpose dataset information (Sections 5.1.1 and 5.1.4) and the type index of the research portal. The type index includes a set of DOIs for each sign type, which can be used to reference specific signs in the corpus. The versioning of the corpus is managed through the use of release-specific DOIs, which are assigned to each version of the corpus.\"}"}

DOI Metadata\\n\\nMachine-readable metadata is associated with every DOI. The DOI metadata of the public corpus follows the DataCite Schema (DataCite Metadata Working Group, 2019), which is designed to provide general information on research datasets.\\n\\nEach DOI object in the corpus provides a title, description and set of keywords in English and German, identifies the authors, publisher, funding body, publication date, and file formats. Each object also specifies how it is connected to other parts of the corpus through specific related identifier relations. These relations indicate, where applicable, which dataset the object belongs to, its older and newer versions, its version-agnostic concept entry and whether there is a corresponding object in the other corpus dataset. A visual representation of these relations can be seen in Figure 1.\\n\\nFollowing best practices established for DOI redirects, users are sent to a dedicated DOI landing page, rather than to the data itself. This landing page provides the most relevant parts of metadata in a human-readable form. Examples of such landing pages can be seen in Figure 2.\\n\\nIn all cases the landing page provides links to the data, other versions and the concept DOI. The remaining choice of metadata depends on the corpus object in question. Dataset objects provide their suggested citation format (see Figure 2a). Transcript objects also offer a list of the individual files belonging to the transcript (see Figure 2b). Each of these files has a direct download link and an indicator of which release the file was added or last changed for. For example, a release 3 transcript may have video files that were unchanged since the first release, pose data that was newly added in release 2 and annotation files that were changed for release 3 due to corrections to the annotation (thus resulting in the creation of a distinct DOI for this transcript release).\\n\\n5.2.2. CMDI Metadata\\n\\nThe metadata provided with DOIs focuses on information that is generally relevant for the handling of a dataset.

Original Recordings\\n\\nWhile the FAIR principles encourage open data, they are also of relevance to restricted data, particularly when it comes to data archival.\\n\\nAll original recordings of the DGS Corpus are long-term archived in the research data repository of Universit\u00e4t Hamburg to provide redundant long-term storage independent of the daily operations of the project. Each recording session is assigned a DOI and provided with relevant metadata. While access to the actual data is restricted, all metadata is public. For recordings that were the basis of transcripts in the public corpus, this connection is indicated by appropriate related identifier relations (see Section 5.2.1).\\n\\n5.4.

These cover a variety of aspects, such as data collection, transcription, corpus publication and associated tools. They also include a data statement \\\\footnote{https://doi.org/10.25592/dgs.korpus.aps} \\\\citep{Schulder2021}, a document type specifically designed to aid users and developers in understanding the provenance and creation process of a dataset to judge its inherent biases \\\\citep{Bender2018}.\\n\\nWith respect to CARE, the documentation provides accountability, showing what measures where taken to create a beneficial resource and support others in using it appropriately. For FAIR they support reusability in general and provenance in particular.\\n\\nRegarding the FAIR handling of the documentation itself, each project note is archived in the research data repository of Universit\u00e4t Hamburg, including DOIs, associated metadata and an open Creative Commons Attribution license. When documentation is updated, old versions remain available under their respective version DOI. The collection in its entirety is also identified by a DOI.\\n\\n6. Conclusion\\n\\nIn this article we presented how the DGS Corpus, a large corpus of German Sign Language, was created following both CARE and FAIR principles. As a linguistic dataset for a cultural and linguistic minority, CARE guided the design of the corpus and informed how FAIR publishing principles might be implemented in an ethical manner. Both the open and restricted access parts of the corpus were influenced and enhanced by both FAIR and CARE.\\n\\nThe DGS Corpus also functions as an example of how FAIR principles can be applied to a complex linguistic dataset. This involves a concept for assigning persistent identifiers in ways that aid linguistic research practices, the creation and integration of diverse metadata, extensive open documentation and long-term archival strategies.\\n\\nThe CARE and FAIRness of the DGS Corpus have been extended step by step over time. We plan to continue this work in future corpus releases. Possible improvements include extending DOI functionality to allow the referencing of exact timestamps in transcripts, publishing additional recordings and fully interconnecting its DOI relation structure with the upcoming digital dictionary of DGS.\\n\\n7.
