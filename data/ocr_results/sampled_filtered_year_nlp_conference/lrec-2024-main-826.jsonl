We obtained the publication of unexamined patent applications from the Japan Patent Office (JPO) and the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). We also obtained patent family information from the DOCDB, that is a bibliographic database maintained by the European Patent Office (EPO). We extracted approximately 1.4M Japanese-English document pairs, which are translations of each other based on the patent families, and extracted about 350M sentence pairs from the document pairs using a translation-based sentence alignment method whose initial translation model is bootstrapped from a dictionary-based sentence alignment method. We experimentally improved the accuracy of the patent translations by 20 bleu points by adding more than 300M sentence pairs obtained from patent applications to 22M sentence pairs obtained from the web.\\n\\nKeywords: Patent application, Parallel corpus, Japanese-English\\n\\n1. Introduction\\n\\nInternational patent applications are numerous but finite. In this work, we aim to disclose the quantity and the quality of the parallel data obtainable from international patent applications in Japanese and English and the potential translation accuracy using these resources. Since most translation for international patent applications in Japan involves Japanese to English, we focus only on translation from Japanese to English.\\n\\nGordon et al. (2021) and Bansal et al. (2022) showed that the accuracy of machine translation improves as the amount of training data or the number of model parameters increases. What makes patent translation different from other machine translation domains is that numerous international patent applications are publicly available after a certain period. However, what we can achieve by exploiting such resources remains unknown.\\n\\nThe history of creating a parallel corpus of Japanese-English patents spans nearly 20 years. Utiyama and Isahara (2007) created a bilingual Japanese-English patent corpus of approximately 2 million sentence pairs for the NTCIR-6 patent retrieval task (Fujii et al., 2007). They applied a bilingual sentence extraction method originally developed for comparable newspaper articles (Utiyama and Isahara, 2003) to patent applications. These bilingual data comprised the first publicly available large-scale Japanese-English patent corpus and were used in the NTCIR-7 patent MT task, which was the first shared task for machine translation between Japanese and English (Fujii et al., 2008).\\n\\nThe JPO-NICT English-Japanese parallel corpus (Japan Patent Office and National Institute of Information and Communications Technology), which has about 350 million Japanese-English patent sentence pairs, was jointly compiled by the Japan Patent Office (JPO) and the National Institute of Information and Communications Technology (NICT) from the publications of unexamined patent applications in the United States and Japan based on patent families. These data, which are available to members of Advanced Language Information Forum (ALAGIN), an organization that resembles LDC, can be used without charge for research and development purposes. The JPO Patent Corpus (Japan Patent Office) has 1M Japanese-English patent sentence pairs and is used in the shared task of patent translation in the Workshop on Asian Translation (WAT), which was first held in 2015.\\n\\nThe JPO-NICT and JPO patent corpora were created around 2015, so they do not reflect the latest contents and technologies. According to Utiyama and Isahara (2007), the JPO-NICT corpus includes JPO and USPTO patents from 1993 but not after 2015. In addition, they were made using a bilingual dictionary-based sentence alignment method (Utiyama and Isahara, 2003). Unfortunately, the quality of dictionary-based alignment (Varga et al., 2005) is generally lower than that of translation-based alignment (Sennrich and Volk, 2010). State-of-the-art sentence alignment technology could improve the quality of Japanese-English patent corpora.\\n\\nWe constructed JaParaPat (Japanese-English parallel patent application corpus), which has about 350M sentence pairs from about 1.4M document\"}"}

To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first attempt to extensively mine parallel patent applications under both routes and align every part of the documents including titles, abstracts, descriptions, and claims.\\n\\n2. Resources\\n\\n2.1. International Patent Application\\n\\nThere are two ways to obtain a patent in a foreign country: directly filing an application in that country based on the Paris Convention (Paris route) or transferring an international application filed to a patent office based on the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT route).\\n\\nUnder the Paris Convention route, after filing a national application in one country, an application is filed in another country, claiming priority under the Paris Convention within a priority period of one year.\\n\\nIn a PCT application, filing a single PCT application in a single language using a common format to a PCT receiving office secures priority on the filing date in every PCT member country. However, to obtain a patent right in a country, a national phase application must be filed within 30 months of the priority date in that country and an examination of the patent must be undergone following the laws of that country. At that time, the patent application must be translated into the language accepted by that country's patent office.\\n\\nFor example, suppose a Japanese company submits a PCT application written in Japanese to the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO). In that case, JPO publishes the Japanese patent application after entry into Japan, and USPTO publishes the English patent application after entry into the United States.\\n\\n2.2. JPO Patent Data\\n\\nSince the Japan Patent Office (JPO) provides bulk download service of patent information, we sent the hard drive to the patent office, which returned it with the necessary patent information. If a company uses this system, it must submit a company registry.\\n\\nWe will make a part of JaParaPat (years 2016-2020, about 110M sentence pairs) publicly available for research purposes after our paper is published.\\n\\nOn December 23, 2021, the JPO abolished the system of publishing domestic re-publication of PCT international patent applications. After this date, PCT applications first filed in Japan in Japanese will only be available if they are granted as a patent after certain amendments, so this study covers the period through 2021.\\n\\nAs shown in the upper part of Figure 1, a JPO XML file represents each patent data by jp-official-gazette element. The kind-of-jp attribute is the gazette type. A is a published patent application, T is a Japanese translation of PCT international patent application, and S is a domestic re-publication of PCT international patent application. Bibliographic information is found in the bibliographic-data element. For documents whose kind-of-jp attribute is A or T, the publication number is obtained from the publication-reference element and the application number is obtained from the application-reference element. For documents whose kind-of-jp attribute is T, the application number is obtained from the pct-or-regional-filing-data element and the publication number is obtained from the pct-or-regional-publishing-data element.\\n\\nWe extracted the text enclosed by the p tags of the XML elements corresponding to the patent's title, abstract, description, and claim. In other words, for sentence alignment, we excluded the claim numbers, the paragraph numbers, the mathematical expressions, figures, etc. Since January 2004, Japanese patent applications have been filed in the XML format. Before 2004, they were in the SGML format. We verified that data in the SGML format have the same extraction targets as in the XML format.\\n\\nWe can use these data for the research and the development of machine translation.\"}"}

We can obtain the documentation and the DTD from USPTO's web page.\\n\\nUSPTO provides patent application full text data from March 15, 2001. Since corresponding patent applications may have been published in Japan one year before they were published in the U.S., this study covers the period from 2000.\\n\\nAs shown in the lower part of Figure 1, a USPTO XML file represents each patent by the us-patent-application element. Bibliographic information is in the us-bibliographic-data-application element. The application number is obtained from the application-reference element, and the publication number is obtained from the publication-reference element.\\n\\nIf a pct-or-regional-filing-data element exists and its doc-number attribute begins with PCT, such as \\\"PCT/JP2005/003817,\\\" we consider it a PCT application, and the value of the doc-number attribute is its application number. The USPTO's PCT patent application does not have the same distinction as that between T and S in the JPO's kind-of-jp attribute.\\n\\n2.4. EPO DOCDB\\nThe European Patent Office (EPO) provides (for a fee) worldwide bibliographic data of patents (DOCDB). We can obtain a sample of DOCDB and its manual from its web site.\\n\\nWe obtained DOCDB, as of April 2022, to get information on patent families.

The priority-claim information is aggregated in the exch:priority-claims element under the exch:bibliographic-data element. Figure 2 is an example of information extracted from exch:exchange-document element in a DOCDB XML file. We extracted the country, doc-number, kind, and date attributes of the document-id element, which is the subject of the priority claim. Kind-code A is an ordinary patent application, and W is a PCT application.\\n\\n3. Methodology\\n\\n3.1. Document Alignment\\n\\nWe mapped the patent applications published by the JPO and USPTO based on the patent families obtained from the EPO's DOCDB. The original data are all in XML, and we implemented the document alignment procedure described below using the xml.etree.ElementTree module in the python standard library.\\n\\nWe considered pairs of Japanese and English patent applications in the same patent family to be translations of each other. If there are more than one such pairs, we selected the oldest document pair because a set of documents claiming priority for the same document is almost always a modified version of the initial application.\\n\\nThe search method for a bilingual document pair differs slightly between the Paris route and the PCT routes. The primary example of the Paris route is where one application claims priority based on another. A US patent that claims priority based on one filed in Japan is a patent in DOCDB where the country attribute of the exchange-document element is US and the country attribute and kind attribute in the priority-claims element are JP and A, respectively. The same is true for a Japanese patent that claims priority based on one filed in the US. In this paper, we refer to the former as 'jp-us' and the latter as 'us-jp' based on the order in which the patents were filed in the countries.\\n\\nWe extracted a pair of Japanese and U.S. patent applications that claims priority based on a shared third patent application, such as a patent that is first filed in China and then filed in Japan and the U.S. For these cases, we first listed a pair of the document-id in the exchange-document element and the document-id in the priority-claim element, for all Japanese and U.S. patent applications. We then extracted JP-US patent application pairs with the same document-id in the priority-claim element. In this paper, we refer to such pairs as 'jp-x-us' where x indicates that a shared third patent application exists.\\n\\nFor the PCT route, we first extracted from the DOCDB applications where the kind attribute of the application-reference element is W. We extracted applications from the JPO where the kind-code attribute is S or T and the doc-number starts with WO. We extracted applications from the USPTO where the pct-or-regional-filing-data starts with PCT. If the application number obtained from the JPO data and the application number obtained from the USPTO data are the same and exist in the DOCDB, we consider the Japanese and the U.S. patent applications to be translations of each other. In this paper, we refer to all PCT applications as 'pct'.\\n\\n3.2. Sentence Alignment\\n\\nWe used two methods for sentence alignment: one based on bilingual dictionaries (Utiyama and Issahara, 2003) and another based on machine translation (Sennrich and Volk, 2010). We first obtained a bilingual patent data using a dictionary-based sentence alignment method and trained a translation model from the bilingual patent data and JParaCrawl (Morishita et al., 2022), a publicly available large-scale Japanese-English parallel corpus collected from the web. We then obtained the final bilingual patent data using a translation-based sentence alignment method.\\n\\nWe divided the Japanese and U.S. patent applications into titles, abstracts, descriptions, and\"}"}

We used split-sentences.perl in Moses for sentence segmentation in both Japanese and English.\\n\\nFor our dictionary-based sentence alignment, we used our implementation of Utiyama and Isahara (2003)'s method. As for bilingual dictionary, we used a Japanese-English dictionary of EDR with 1,690,174 entries (Japan Electronic Dictionary Research Institute, Ltd.). We used mecab-unidic for Japanese word segmentation and TreeTagger for English tokenization.\\n\\nFor translation-based sentence alignment, we used Bleualign. We used fairseq (Ott et al., 2019) for machine translation.\\n\\n4. JaParaPat Overview\\n\\n4.1. Data Statistics\\n\\nTable 1 shows the number of annually collected document and sentence pairs from 2000 to 2001. In this table, the numbers are divided into jp-us, jp-x-us, us-jp, and pct, as described in Section 3.1. Here, the years are based on the publication year of the Japanese patent applications.\\n\\nThe parallel corpus has about 350M sentence pairs from about 1.4M document pairs. Since the USPTO U.S. patent data are only available after 2001, no Japanese patent applications published in 2000 have any available U.S. patent applications as priority claims. Since we used the DOCDB as of April 2022, the patent family are incomplete on the applications published in Japan in 2021. Thus, scant parallel data exist for 2021.\\n\\nThe ratio of Paris routes to PCT routes in the parallel corpus is almost one-to-one. The former route has more document pairs, but the latter route has more sentence pairs because document pairs in the Paris route are not necessarily translations of each other, while document pairs in the PCT route must be translations of each other. In general, we extracted 60-70% of the sentences as parallel sentence pairs from the Japanese and English document pairs. Within the Paris route, the amount of bilingual data for us-jp is the largest, followed by jp-us and jp-x-us.\\n\\n4.2. Data Format\\n\\nFigure 3 shows an example of Japanese and English text files for a patent document pair. We first assigned a pair of publication numbers in Japan and the U.S. as an ID for a parallel document pair, such as JP2021000998-US20210139186. We divided Japanese and U.S. patent documents into four parts: title, abstract, description, and claim, separated each part into paragraphs and sentences, and finally assigned a concatenation of a document pair ID, a part, a paragraph number, a sentence number within a paragraph, and a sentence number within a document as an ID to a sentence.\\n\\nThe leftmost screenshot in Figure 4 shows an example of a sentence alignment file for a patent document pair. The first column represents the sentence number within a Japanese document, and the second column represents the sentence number within an English document. Multiple numbers in one column represent a many-to-many alignment. This configuration allows us to create a claim-specific translation model by extracting only the sentence pairs in the claim, or a context-aware translation model by extracting consecutive sentence pairs in the same paragraph.\\n\\nThe middle and rightmost screenshots in Figure 4 shows examples of International Patent Classification (IPC) data for each document pairs. This information allows us to create a translation model dedicated to a specific field.\\n\\n5. Experiments\\n\\n5.1. Training and Test Data\\n\\nTo confirm the quality of JaParaPat, we conducted translation experiments from Japanese to English. Table 2 shows the number of document pairs, sentence pairs, and the number of words on the English side of the training data for the translation model. We used the sentence pairs from 2000 to the first half of 2021 to train the translation models.\\n\\nTable 3 shows the number of sentences and words on the English side of the test data. We randomly sampled 1,000 sentences for the test data and 2,000 sentences for the validation data from the second half of 2021 in the Paris and PCT routes, respectively. Note that while these Paris and PCT test sets cover a wide range of topics, they are not guaranteed to be parallel sentence pairs because they are automatically extracted and sampled.\\n\\nWe also used as test data the in-house Japanese PCT patent applications published or to be published in 2022 or later and their translations into English by two translation companies specializing in patent translation. The target domain is information and communication technology (ICT) and includes a wide range of content from hardware to software. Preliminary studies revealed that the scores of automated evaluations varied by trans-\"}"}

Comparison of Sentence Alignment Methods\\n\\nFirst, we examined the accuracy of the translation model used in our translation-based sentence alignment method. We collected about 34M sentence pairs (2000-2013Paris_dict) from document pairs in the Paris route from 2000 to 2013 using a dictionary-based sentence alignment method. We then created a translation model trained on these 34M patent sentence pairs and JParaCrawl (2000-2013Paris_dict+JParaCrawl). Using this translation model for translation-based sentence alignment, we collected about 43M sentence pairs (2000-2013Paris_trans) from the same document pairs used for dictionary-based sentence alignment.\\n\\nTable 5 shows that the translation accuracy (BLEU) improved when we combined the sentence pairs from the patent applications and the web. When we use translation-based sentence alignment, we collected more sentence pairs (34M to 43M) with higher quality (62.6/51.5 to 63.4/53.0) than dictionary-based sentence alignment. Recent research shows that translation-based sentence alignment method can obtain better and more bilingual sentence pairs than dictionary-based method (Ba\u00f1\u00f3n et al., 2020; Morishita et al., 2022) and we confirmed this finding in our experiment.\\n\\nTest1 and test2 differed in sacreBLEU by 10 points in the models trained on the patent corpus. Since both translation companies manually post-edited the output of their patent translation systems, we assume that the differences in the machine translation and post-editing methods significantly impacted the automatic evaluation measurements. The results indicate that post-editing bias may be a problem in the future for parallel corpora collected from patent applications because more and more patent translation companies are adopting machine translation post-editing.\\n\\n5.4. Japanese-to-English Translation Accuracy\\n\\nTable 6 shows the translation accuracy of the model trained from the collected patent sentence pairs. Compared to JParaCrawl, JaParaPat improved the patent translation accuracy by 20 BLEU points. Comparing the Paris route and the PCT routes, although the amount of data is almost identical (around 150M), the Paris route has generally higher translation accuracy. We assume this result is because the Paris route contains a greater variety of patent applications since the PCT route is mainly used by large companies.\\n\\nTraining the translation model from more than 300M patent bilinguals from both the Paris and PCT routes improved translation accuracy, although the improvement is moderate and unstable. However, when we added 22M web-crawled sentence pairs of JParaCrawl to 337M patent sentence pairs of JaParaPat, the translation accuracy of test2 and ASPEC increased, suggesting that the patent sentence pairs lack diversity. We observed that the perplexity of the patent texts is low compared to that of web texts. Adding web text makes the patent translation model more robust than increasing the amount of patent text.\\n\\n6. Related Works\\n\\n6.1. Patent Parallel Corpus\\n\\nWith the increasing popularity of the PCT international patent applications and such new technologies as sentence alignment using neural machine translation models, a different approach has recently emerged for creating a parallel patent corpus. In 2011, World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) created the Corpus Of Parallel Patent Applications (COPPA) from the titles and abstracts of PCT applications. COPPA V2.0 (Junczys-Dowmunt et al., 2016) consists of eight language pairs, mainly English, and has about 1 million sentence pairs of Japanese-English data. ParaPat (Soares et al., 2020) is a bilingual data set of 22 language pairs created from patent abstracts in Google Patents, with 17M sentence pairs of Japanese-English data. COPPA and ParaPat use Hunalign (Varga et al., 2005), a dictionary-based sentence alignment tool.\\n\\nEuroPat (Heafield et al., 2022) is a parallel patent corpus of six European languages as well as English collected from USPTO and EPO. It extracts sentence pairs from granted patents with an emphasis on quality. It uses the API provided by the EPO to obtain patent families for document alignment and translates non-English documents into English for sentence alignment with Bleualign-cpp, a translation-based sentence alignment tool developed in the ParaCrawl Project (Ba\u00f1\u00f3n et al., 2020).\\n\\nOur approach resembles EuroPat, although we used unexamined patent applications rather than granted patents and made alignments between\"}"}

Japanese-English Parallel Corpus\\n\\nIn areas other than patents, ASPEC (Nakazawa et al., 2016) is one of the first publicly available Japanese-English parallel corpora. It is comprised of English summaries attached to Japanese scientific and technical papers. Its domain is close to patents, but it only has 3 million sentence pairs. ASPEC has been used in a shared task of WAT since 2014 (Nakazawa et al., 2014).\\n\\nJParaCrawl (Morishita et al., 2022) is one of the largest publicly available Japanese-English parallel corpora. It is a web-crawled corpus that contains a wide variety of domains. JParaCrawl has been used in news translation task and general machine translation task in WMT since 2020 (Barrault et al., 2020).\\n\\nAlthough the JPO-NICT corpus is one of the largest publicly available Japanese-English parallel patent corpora, its construction is unknown since it has not been published as a technical paper. Assuming that this corpus was made from a procedure similar to the NICIR-7 PATMT (Utiyama and Isahara, 2007), it identifies Japanese patents by the priority number listed in the U.S. patents. Thus, this corpus only covers the JP-US of the Paris route in our term. It used dictionary-based sentence alignment, while we used sentence-based alignment.\\n\\nThe newly created JaParaPati is one of the largest and highest-quality Japanese-English patent parallel corpora. It will serve as the foundation for future machine translation research in the science and technology field.\\n\\n6.3. Sentence Alignment\\n\\nSentence alignment can be classified into three categories: a bilingual dictionary-based method (Utiyama and Isahara, 2003; Varga et al., 2005) such as hunalign, a machine translation-based method (Sennrich and Volk, 2010) such as Bleualign, or a multilingual sentence embedding-based method (Thompson and Koehn, 2019; Chousa et al., 2020) such as Vecalign. Although the sentence embedding-based method is the most accurate approach, it is unfortunately also the most computationally expensive. Since we must process a large amount of data in this work, we used a translation-based method to balance speed and accuracy.\\n\\n7. Conclusion\\n\\nWe extracted patentsentence pairs as exhaustively as possible from Japanese and U.S. patent applications from 2000-2021 and constructed a parallel patent corpus of more than 300M sentence pairs. By training a translation model on the parallel patent corpus, we improved the patent translation accuracy by about 20 bleu points compared to JParaCrawl by using 22M sentence pairs collected from the web. We collected more and better sentence pairs by using a translation-based sentence alignment method compared to a dictionary-based sentence alignment method.\\n\\nFuture work includes increasing the number of parameters in the translation model and designing a filter to remove noise in the parallel corpus to improve translation accuracy with reference to the study of data scaling laws (Gordon et al., 2021; Bansal et al., 2022).\"}"}
