Introduction\\nUnderstanding the entirety of texts, including their meaning, coherence, communicative functions and other aspects, has become increasingly important in both linguistics and NLP. In this respect, human-annotated language corpora provide a unique and invaluable foundation for both fields. In discourse-oriented research, while there are many hand-annotated resources available for local discourse analysis, mostly following the research line of the Penn Discourse Treebank (PDTB, Prasad et al., 2008), there is still much to be desired in terms of global analysis of discourse structure, allowing hierarchical discourse analysis/parsing and a deeper understanding of the underlying relational semantics and the overall meaning of a text. In addition, until recently, much of the research was based on the first available resources (see Section 2) and thus mostly focused on English.\\n\\nIn this paper, we introduce the Czech RST Discourse Treebank (CzRST-DT), a collection of Czech journalistic texts manually annotated using the Rhetorical Structure Theory, an influential global coherence model (Mann and Thompson, 1988; Taboada and Mann, 2006). Our corpus project aims to contribute to the growing body of resources with global coherence analysis, to increase the typological variety of languages analyzed in these resources, and thus to expand the research possibilities in discourse studies. By enlarging the accessible data and sharing our expertise in corpus design, our objective is also to provide valuable insights into the applicability of the RST framework.\\n\\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we present relevant related work. In Section 3, we describe the data and tools used, the corpus development is described in Section 4. Section 5 presents basic corpus statistics including the IAA evaluation. Section 6 provides a discussion, Section 7 shows an example RST analysis and Section 8 concludes the paper.\\n\\n2. Related work\\n2.1. Rhetorical Structure Theory\\nThe Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST, Mann and Thompson, 1988) is a widely recognized framework for analyzing text structure and coherence. The goal of RST is to provide a formalized analysis of a text that captures a reconstruction of the author's intentions from the reader's point of view. The theory is based on the assumption that coherent texts consist of minimal units (elementary discourse units, EDUs) that are recursively linked through rhetorical relations. RST treats an entire document as a projective tree structure (compare the example analysis in Example 7). The type of the rhetorical relation linking discourse units is defined in terms of the author's intended effect on the reader together with the application of the principle of nuclearity. The principle of nuclearity suggests two types of rhetorical relations: in mononuclear relations, one text unit entering a rhetorical relation represents more essential information for the text's purpose \u2013 the Nucleus (N), while the\"}"}

In multinuclear relations, the importance of all units is equal: all units are Nuclei. Also, multinuclear relations may consist of more than two units.\\n\\n2.2. RST-annotated Corpora\\n\\nThe RST framework has attracted significant interest and has undergone extensive development and testing. RST-style discourse corpora have been constructed for many languages. The first one, the RST Discourse Treebank (RST-DT, Carlson et al., 2003) annotated for rhetorical relations on 385 English articles from the Wall Street Journal, has become the main resource for experimenting in discourse parsing and similar tasks. Further RST annotation projects followed, both for English (Taboada and Renkema, 2008), (Zeldes, 2017) and for other languages, e.g.: Spanish (Da Cunha et al., 2011), Brazilian Portuguese (Cardoso et al., 2011), Dutch (Redeker et al., 2012), Basque (Iruskieta et al., 2013), German (Stede and Neumann, 2014), Russian (Toldova et al., 2017), Bangla (Das and Stede, 2018), or are in preparation: Persian (Shahmohammadi et al., 2021). Some projects are multilingual: Spanish \u2013 Chinese (Cao et al., 2018) or English \u2013 Spanish \u2013 Basque (Iruskieta et al., 2014).\\n\\nThe usefulness of Rhetorical Structure Theory for various tasks is wide. Apart from discourse parsing (Li et al., 2022), it has been used in many different NLP subfields, such as natural language generation (input: communicative goals and semantic representation, output: text), extractive and abstractive summarization (using the (strong) nuclearity principle), sentiment analysis (aspect-based and hierarchical SA), argument mining, and in writing research (RST as a training tool for writing effective texts, coherence evaluation). A comprehensive overview of RST applications can be found in Hou et al. (2020).\\n\\n3. Data and Tools\\n\\nFor the annotation of rhetorical structures, we have selected 54 Czech journalistic texts with a length between 6 and 42 sentences from different sub-genres, see Table 1.\\n\\n| Text genre | Count |\\n|------------|-------|\\n| comment    | 14    |\\n| survey     | 3     |\\n| news       | 10    |\\n| weather    | 2     |\\n| cultural review | 7   |\\n| overview   | 2     |\\n| sports     | 4     |\\n| letter     | 2     |\\n| essay      | 5     |\\n| description| 1     |\\n| advice     | 3     |\\n| invitation | 1     |\\n\\nTable 1: Genre division of the annotated documents\\n\\nThe original texts are part of the richly annotated Prague Dependency Treebank 3.5 (Haji\u010d et al., 2018), i.e. they have been independently annotated for local, PDTB-like discourse coherence, including implicit relations and secondary connectives. The treebank introduced here is annotated in a stand-off way on the plain text of the documents (see below), but will allow nevertheless for a future comparison of local and global coherence annotations on the same data.\\n\\nThe annotations were performed in a locally installed RSTWeb annotation tool (Zeldes, 2016), a freely available and easily configurable client-server tool with a web browser-based interface. The tool stores the texts and their annotations in an internal database and exports them in an XML format with the extension .rs3. The very same format can be used as an input to the RST-Tace tool (Wan et al., 2019), a freely available tool that we used to measure the interannotator agreement (IAA, see Section 5).\\n\\n4. Corpus Development Process\\n\\n4.1. Annotation Procedure\\n\\nPrimary practical considerations regarding the development of the treebank concerned the trade-off between comparability with other RST projects and the novelty of the approach based on our previous research on higher-level relations and connectives in shallow discourse annotation (Pol\u00e1kov\u00e1 et al., 2021) and on other relevant work, e.g. Stede (2008), which would suggest some major adjustments to the theory. Finally, for the sake of comparability and usefulness for the discourse community, we adhere most closely to the recent version of RST and to the annotation guidelines applied in the German Potsdam Commentary Corpus (Stede et al., 2016, 2017). Differences in the relation taxonomy are described below in 4.2.\\n\\nThe annotation procedure consists of: (i) segmenting a text into elementary discourse units (EDUs), typically represented by clauses with a predicate verb, (ii) building the tree structure by progressively linking the EDUs and larger units through\"}"}

At the point of creating a rhetorical link, its type (a label from the taxonomy) is also assigned.\\n\\nTwo annotators with linguistic background were trained on the same texts for pilot annotations, followed by two rounds of full-fledged annotations. After the IAA measurements, each round was concluded with qualitative consistency checks and discussions and subsequent updates of the guidelines. Five texts of different genres from the full annotations were double-annotated to measure inter-annotator agreement using the RST-Tace tool (see Section 5). The annotators did not know which documents were selected for the IAA measurement. Finally, the data were cleaned before publication. This included e.g. checking the connectivity of the whole structure, detecting and removing redundant \u201cempty\u201d levels in the tree caused by annotator errors, checking and correcting cases of interrupted segments (use of Same-unit and its structuring), consistent handling of headings and subheadings, etc. In this way, the published data is carefully checked, both automatically and manually, and the analyses can be considered as gold.\\n\\n4.2. Taxonomy of RST Relations\\n\\nThe original account of RST proposes a set of 24 rhetorical relations. The RST Discourse Treebank distinguishes 78 types of relations in 16 classes (Carlson and Marcu, 2001). The annotation in the Potsdam Commentary Corpus (PCC), the RST version closest to our approach, uses 31 rhetorical relations (Stede et al., 2017, 2016). The PCC taxonomy has been adapted for the annotation of newspaper editorials, i.e., opinion texts. Therefore, pragmatic relations play a key role in it. Both the classical RST of Mann and Thompson and of the Potsdam group emphasize that the taxonomy of rhetorical markers is open and can be adapted to the nature of the annotated texts.\\n\\nThe set of rhetorical relations used for our annotation contains 36+1 relations, see Table 2 which also reports the distributions of the relations in the corpus. Differences from the PCC guidelines include the addition of the following six (5+1) relations:\\n\\n- **Gradation** \u2013 we lacked a straightforward label for a common situation of escalating the content importance, often represented by connective patterns such as *not only ... but also*.\\n- **Disjunction** \u2013 classifying disjunctive links as *Conjunction* (or *Otherwise*) seemed like a loss of information.\\n\\n4 compare also the relation set and definitions at [https://www.sfu.ca/rst/01intro/definitions.html](https://www.sfu.ca/rst/01intro/definitions.html).\\n\\n| Rhetorical relation | Frequency |\\n|---------------------|-----------|\\n| Primarily pragmatic, mononuclear background | 42 |\\n| concession | 64 |\\n| concession-N | 4 |\\n| antithesis | 28 |\\n| evidence | 37 |\\n| reason | 24 |\\n| reason-N | 10 |\\n| justify | 33 |\\n| evaluation-S | 22 |\\n| evaluation-N | 14 |\\n| motivation | 6 |\\n| enablement | 4 |\\n| Primarily semantic, mononuclear | 29 |\\n| circumstance | 41 |\\n| result | 18 |\\n| condition | 29 |\\n| otherwise | 5 |\\n| unless | 3 |\\n| means | 10 |\\n| purpose | 18 |\\n| elaboration | 135 |\\n| entity-elaboration | 84 |\\n| interpretation | 23 |\\n| solutionhood | 11 |\\n| gradation | 13 |\\n| Textual, mononuclear | 55 |\\n| preparation | 3 |\\n| summary | 8 |\\n| restatement | 48 |\\n| attribution | 49 |\\n| list | 102 |\\n| sequence | 31 |\\n| contrast | 47 |\\n| restatement-M | 6 |\\n| Technical relation (for units split by an embedded content) | 36 |\\n| same-unit | |\\n\\nTable 2: Overview of rhetorical relations in five rhetorical types used for the annotation of the Czech RST Discourse Treebank, with overall frequencies of the relations in the corpus.\"}"}

The last, 18th unit says that the date of the trial has not yet been set, which is a kind of additional information (satellite), appended to the main text topic (nucleus). At the same time, the satellite shows a denied expectation, which is the opposite direction of nuclearity to that defined as Concession.\\n\\nRestatement-M(ultinuclear) was reintroduced for contents of equal importance. Attribution was reintroduced as a result of an earlier segmentation decision: to prevent an inconsistent analysis, where an attribution clause merges into one unit with only a part of a multi-unit reported speech. For instance, previously She said that she would come only was one elementary unit, and that she would bring some food was another. In our approach, these are three separate EDUs. For practical reasons, we have reintroduced the technical relation of Same-unit, to account for discontinuous units. Such a situation is illustrated by Example 2 and Figure 1. In our proposal, by default, the embedded content is appended to the leftmost part of the discontinuous unit.\\n\\nExample 2\\n\\nCastro prohl\u00e1sil, \u017ee Spojen\u00e9 st\u00e1ty, a\u010dkoli mohly ud\u011blit 150 000 v\u00edz, poskytly jich pouze 11 000.\\n\\nCastro said that the USA, even though they could have issued 150,000 visas, only issued 11,000 of them.\\n\\nTable 3 gives an overview of the basic treebank figures, such as the number of the relations annotated etc. Table 4 shows the inter-annotator agreement by the RST-Tace tool on five texts annotated by two annotators. The annotations of these files had to be slightly modified to meet the input requirements of the tool, i.e. they were changed to form a single tree in cases where a piece of text remained unconnected (a meta information, a title and a subtitle, etc.). The number of sentences after the modification is given in brackets. In addition, the tool only compares document pairs with unified EDU segmentation, thus disregarding the most burning issue of disagreement (see Section 6). Therefore, the IAA documents had to be segmented in a unified way first.\\n\\nThe measurements show that despite the relatively low overall scores (the F-measure varied from 0.5 to 0.71 for nuclearity, from 0.21 to 0.5 for relation assignment, and from 0.41 to 0.66 for average), there are many near-matches (such as opposite nuclearity, close relations, different number of units in an otherwise corresponding multinuclear structure, etc.). This is also confirmed by the manual inspection of the tree structures (see Section 6).\\n\\nDiscussion\\n\\nThis section explains some annotation choices and discusses the most common disagreements from the qualitative point of view.\\n\\nSegmentation. Surprisingly, the most problematic part of the annotation was a uniform segmentation into EDUs.

We decided to follow an instruction to segment as much as possible, to account for possibly relevant pieces of information (e.g. in contexts like This is the question that bothers me the most. we distinguish two EDUs.)\\n\\nThis decision might have led to a higher number of Entity-elaboration labels in our corpus.\\n\\nAttribution and reported content: To avoid inconsistent analysis, where an attribution clause merges into one unit with only a part of a multi-unit reported speech, we segment attribution clauses from the content they introduce based on a list of verbs of saying and an additional set of annotation instructions (see the annotation manual, Pol\u00e1kov\u00e1, 2023) and we reintroduce the Attribution label. The annotation of attribution is illustrated in Figure 1 above.\\n\\nNext type of disagreements concern the tree structure: A thorough comparison of disagreements in tree structures by two annotators suggests the following findings: (i) Good agreement on the structure and labeling can be achieved on the lowest, local tree level. This may be attributed to the guidance of syntax and local coherence clues, but partly also to the solid linguistic background of the annotators. (ii) There is a good agreement on the identification of the most central EDUs, i.e. the structures of both annotators point to the same units as being the most important ones (strong nuclearity principle), the overall structures show similar global patterns. Disagreements, on the other hand, mostly concern differences in the stepwise process of linking the largest blocks of texts. There is an observed tendency to make the highest tree levels multinuclear, and thus the analysis becomes more technical. At least in our type of data (newspaper texts of different types), there sometimes seems to be no reliable (surface or semantic) cue as to how to connect the largest blocks (three or four of them). The more arbitrary the solution seems, the more annotators tend to create a multinuclear relation in which all large blocks are on the same level. In this way, the purpose of the analysis \u2013 to build a hierarchical structure \u2013 gives way to a technical solution (to build a connected graph). This conveys the message that rhetorical relations at this highest level may be vague and, in most cases, open to different yet relevant interpretations. A typical pattern of disagreement at the highest tree level in our data is the interpretation as [Background/Preparation (S) \u2192 Main message (N)], as opposed to [Main message (N) \u2190 Elaboration (S)].\\n\\nThis is also visible in the analysis of Example 3 in Section 7 below, which corresponds to the former pattern, with an alternative analysis (the first segment \u2013 the title as the strongly nuclear segment) that would correspond to the latter pattern. In our opinion, this is a matter of a specific text type (here, journalism) and can only be attributed to personal preferences of the annotators. It is an example of the interpretative subjectivity of any text recipient, including skilled text researchers, but it also reveals where the RST framework is likely to reach its limits.\\n\\nRecognizing subjectivity is an unavoidable aspect of text interpretation. The literature and our own previous research in this direction show (Dane\u0161, 1988, Pol\u00e1kov\u00e1 and Synkov\u00e1, 2021) that in most cases this is related to the different accessibility of different types of inferences to the recipients. For a reliable global coherence modeling, we see the following mitigation strategies: agreement of the annotators after joint discussion, agreement after adjudication by a third judge, or the acceptance of the \\\"good\\\", relevant disagreement (Das et al., 2017). In line with the insights of Plank (2022), we incline to refer to this phenomenon as human label variation.\\n\\nExample RST Analysis\\n\\nFigure 2 shows a rhetorical structure analysis for the Czech text in Example 3 below. The example text contains 5 paragraphs, 10 sentences, 13 elementary discourse units (EDUs) and 12 rhetorical relations (among them 2 multinuclear). According to the analysis, the segment most central to the text's purpose (the strongly nuclear EDU) is the segment 5: 8\\n\\n8. I use this English translation exemplifying the strong nuclearity of the central segment.\":}"}
