The comparability of the corpora is ensured by a comparable crawling setup and the usage of identical crawling and post-processing technology. All the corpora were linguistically annotated with the state-of-the-art CLASSLA-Stanza linguistic processing pipeline, and enriched with document-level genre information via the Transformer-based multilingual X-GENRE classifier, which further enhances comparability at the level of linguistic annotation and metadata enrichment. The genre-focused analysis of the resulting corpora shows a rather consistent distribution of genres throughout the seven corpora, with variations in the most prominent genre categories being well-explained by the economic strength of each language community. A comparison of the distribution of genre categories across the corpora indicates that web corpora from less developed countries primarily consist of news articles. Conversely, web corpora from economically more developed countries exhibit a smaller proportion of news content, with a greater presence of promotional and opinionated texts.\\n\\nKeywords: web corpora, South Slavic languages, linguistic processing, genre identification\\n\\n1. Introduction\\nThe South Slavic languages constitute one of the three major branches within the Slavic language family. They are mostly spoken in Central and Southeastern Europe, spanning from the Slovenian Alps, across the Adriatic and Dinarides regions, to Bulgaria and the Black Sea. Despite their widespread use, many languages within this group remain relatively low-resourced and underrepresented in the field of natural language processing. According to a recent report on the state of technologies for European languages (Rehm and Way, 2023), the support with the core Language Technologies (LT) \u2013 which include corpora, models and language technologies, such as text and speech processing and machine translation \u2013 was shown to be less than moderate for South Slavic languages, with Bosnian and Macedonian having weak support to no support in all LT areas. In order to facilitate the development of language technologies for these languages, it is crucial to have access to substantial amounts of textual data. Such data serve as the foundation for language technologies, including language models and machine translation systems. Additionally, general text corpora \u2013 that is, corpora that cover broad language use and are not specifically restricted to any particular subject, register or genre \u2013 enable linguists and other researchers to analyze linguistic phenomena based on statistically significant amounts of data. Web crawling, an automated method for collecting text corpora, is one of the primary approaches for quick collection of such data. Recently, the MaCoCu project (Ba\u00f1\u00f3n et al., 2022) used this method to develop and make freely available monolingual and parallel datasets for over 10 under-resourced languages, including the South Slavic languages.\\n\\nThis paper introduces the CLASSLA-web corpora, which are based on the MaCoCu datasets and have been additionally enriched with linguistic annotation and genre information. This collection of corpora represents, to best of our knowledge, the first comparable corpus collection that encompasses the entire language group. The corpora are considered comparable as they were collected and processed with the same tools and within the same time frame. The paper presents a comprehensive overview of the various stages involved in creating the corpora and offers initial insights into their content based on genre information. The creation of the CLASSLA-web corpora involved three main steps: 1) web crawling based on top-level national domains, and subsequent data post-processing and filtering; 2) linguistic annotation with the latest CLASSLA-Stanza pipeline (Ljube\u0161i\u0107 and Dobrovoljc, 2019; Terc\u00f3n and Ljube\u0161i\u0107, 2023), the state-of-the-art pipeline for processing South Slavic languages; and 3) genre annotation, which provides an insight into the functional content of\\n\\n1 https://macocu.eu/\"}"}

Examples of genres are News, Promotion, Legal, etc. Genre annotation provides valuable insights into the functional content of the corpora, enabling genre-based corpus studies and more focused natural language processing applications in machine translation (Van der Wees et al., 2018) or summarization (Stewart and Callan, 2009).\\n\\nThe paper is organized as follows. Firstly, we provide an overview of the related work on construction of web corpora and the automatic genre identification in Section 2. Next, in Section 3, we present the process of creating and curating the CLASSLA-web corpora, whose content is analyzed in Section 4. Lastly, the paper concludes with Section 5, where we summarize the main findings and present future work.\\n\\n### 2. Related Work\\n\\n#### 2.1. Web Corpora\\n\\nThe tradition of building web corpora can be followed back to the WaCky initiative (Baroni et al., 2009), inside which first web corpora for large European languages were built. Two other notable initiatives include the CoW corpora (Sch\u00e4fer et al., 2012), developed for large European languages, and the TenTen corpora (Jakub\u00ed\u010dek et al., 2013), created for many languages, including some of South Slavic languages, namely Slovenian and Bulgarian. However, an important limitation of the TenTen corpora is that they are accessible only through concordancers of the Lexical Computing company, which require a paid subscription.\\n\\nRecently, numerous web-based datasets have emerged from the Common Crawl (https://commoncrawl.org) and the Internet Archive data collections (https://archive.org). Most prominent collections include the cc100 dataset (Conneau et al., 2020), the mC4 dataset (Xue et al., 2021), and the OSCAR dataset (Su\u00e1rez et al., 2019). While these multilingual collections are highly useful for multilingual language modelling tasks, they suffer, inter alia, from blind spots, such as an unexplainable small amount of all Western South Slavic (Slovenian, Croatian, Bosnian, Montenegrin, Serbian) data in OSCAR (https://oscar-project.github.io/documentation/versions/oscar-2301/) and an unexpectedly small amount of Croatian content in the mC4 dataset (Xue et al., 2021).\\n\\nThe previously developed open web corpora for South Slavic languages adhere to the naming convention of the WaCky (Baroni et al., 2009) initiative (e.g., slWaC, hrWaC, srWaC). However, they were actually built using the TenTen technology, more specifically, the SpiderLing crawler (Suchomel et al., 2012), the jusT ext text extraction tool, and the Onion near-deduplication tool (Pom\u00edk\u00e1lek, 2011). The first web corpora of South Slavic languages were compiled for Slovenian (slWaC) and Croatian (hrWaC) (Ljube\u0161i\u0107 and Erjavec, 2011). Three years later, the list of languages was expanded to include Bosnian (bsWaC) and Serbian (srWaC) (Ljube\u0161i\u0107 and Klubi\u010dka, 2014). Additionally, the Croatian and Slovenian crawls were later updated (Erjavec et al., 2015). However, there have been no recent activities related to open web corpora for South Slavic languages.\\n\\n#### 2.2. Genre Prediction\\n\\nUntil recently, the available technologies for text classification, including support vector machines and logistic regression classifiers, were insufficient to accurately identify genres across languages and datasets (Sharoff et al., 2010; Kuzman et al., 2023a). However, recent advancements in deep neural technologies led to a breakthrough in this field. Transformer-based language models (Vaswani et al., 2017), specifically those fine-tuned on manually-annotated genre datasets, demonstrated the capability to identify genres in various web corpora and languages (see R\u00f6nqvist et al. (2021); Kuzman et al. (2022)). The main advantage of Transformer models in this task is that their representations incorporate both lexical and syntactic knowledge about a text, which is crucial for accurate genre prediction (Kuzman and Ljube\u0161i\u0107, 2022). The advancement in these technologies has facilitated the development of multilingual Transformer-based genre classifiers, which can now already be effectively applied to large-scale datasets in various languages. Recently, Laippala et al. (2022) published the Register OsCar dataset, consisting of 351 million documents in 14 languages to which genre labels were automatically assigned. The dataset was created by applying the multilingual genre classifier (R\u00f6nqvist et al., 2021) on the OSCAR datasets (Su\u00e1rez et al., 2019). Their classifier was trained on genre datasets in multiple languages and uses a schema with 8 genre labels, such as Narrative, Opinion and Interactive Discussion. The unseen-language classification was evaluated based on annotated datasets in eight new languages (Arabic, Catalan, Chinese, Hindi, Indonesian, Portuguese, Spanish and Urdu). The evaluation results for these new\"}"}

These endeavors were closely followed by the first experiments with automatic genre annotation on the MaCoCu data. Kuzman et al. (2023b) applied the X-GENRE classifier, which is described in more detail in Section 3.2, to the English part of the parallel MaCoCu corpora. Based on a preliminary manual evaluation, the genre classifier achieved a macro F1 score of 0.73 and a micro F1 score of 0.88 on a small sample of English texts derived from the Slovenian-English MaCoCu corpus.\\n\\n3. Construction of the Corpora\\n\\n3.1. Collecting and Curating Web Corpora\\n\\nThe CLASSLA-web corpora are derived from the web crawls that were gathered and curated inside the MaCoCu project (Ba\u00f1\u00f3n et al., 2022). Namely, the following datasets were used: Bosnian web corpus MaCoCu-bs 1.0 (Ba\u00f1\u00f3n et al., 2023a), Bulgarian web corpus MaCoCu-bg 2.0 (Ba\u00f1\u00f3n et al., 2023b), Croatian web corpus MaCoCu-hr 2.0 (Ba\u00f1\u00f3n et al., 2023c), Macedonian web corpus MaCoCu-mk 2.0 (Ba\u00f1\u00f3n et al., 2023d), Montenegrin web corpus MaCoCu-cnr 1.0 (Ba\u00f1\u00f3n et al., 2023e), Serbian web corpus MaCoCu-sr 1.0 (Ba\u00f1\u00f3n et al., 2023f), and Slovenian web corpus MaCoCu-sl 2.0 (Ba\u00f1\u00f3n et al., 2023g). They comprise 7 South Slavic languages written in Latin and/or Cyrillic script.\\n\\nThe MaCoCu corpora were collected by crawling the national top-level domains, such as, in the case of Slovenian, the Slovenian top-level domain.si. The primary focus of the crawl was on the top-level domain, but texts from generic domains (.com, .net etc.) were also collected if 1. either in the list of seed URLs obtained from previous crawls, or 2. connected well through hyperlinks with the websites in the national top-level domain, and containing sufficient data in the target language. The MaCoCu crawler, which is based on the SpiderLing crawler (Suchomel et al., 2012), was used for the crawling. The crawling process was followed by a thorough post-processing to assure high quality data. Firstly, the justext tool was employed to remove boilerplate content (Pomik\u00e1lek, 2011). Secondly, the onion tool was used to identify near-duplicate documents (Pomik\u00e1lek, 2011). Thirdly, the Monotextor tool was used to enhance language identification accuracy and to evaluate the fluency of paragraphs using a language model. Lastly, we further refined the corpora by removing very short texts (shorter than 75 words or consisting only of paragraphs shorter than 70 characters) and texts originating from web domains that had been manually or automatically identified as automatically-generated.\\n\\nLanguage identification for certain under-resourced languages within the MaCoCu corpora has proven to be a challenge, as these languages are frequently under-represented in the training data of wide-coverage language identification tools. This challenge is particularly pronounced when attempting to differentiate between Bosnian, Croatian, Montenegrin, and Serbian, as these South Slavic languages exhibit a significant level of mutual intelligibility. Thus, to ensure a high level of accuracy, we employed multiple language identification tools at various stages of the pipeline. Firstly, the identification process began with the Google's Compact Language Detector 2 (CLD2) at the document level during the crawling phase. Secondly, the FastSpell tool was used for a more refined language identification at the paragraph level during the post-processing of the corpora with the Monotextor tool. In these initial two steps, Bosnian, Croatian, Serbian and Montenegrin languages were treated as a single macro-language, and the objective in the case of these languages was to determine whether the text belongs to this macro-language or not. Finally, a specialized classifier was employed to distinguish between these four languages. Specifically, they were identified using a Naive Bayes classifier (Rupnik et al., 2023), which relied on lists of words specific to each variety, which were extracted from web texts published on national top-level domains. This approach assumed that, for instance, the Croatian top-level domain (.hr) is predominantly associated with the Croatian language.\\n\\n3.2. Genre Annotation\\n\\nOne crucial part of the creation of CLASSLA-web corpora was also enrichment of the corpora with metadata on genres. This information offers valuable insights into the functional content of the corpora. Furthermore, it facilitates the creation of subcorpora based on genres, which can be used for genre-based linguistic analyses. We used the multilingual X-GENRE classifier, which was applied to the English part of the parallel MaCoCu corpora. Based on a preliminary manual evaluation, the genre classifier achieved a macro F1 score of 0.73 and a micro F1 score of 0.88 on a small sample of English texts derived from the Slovenian-English MaCoCu corpus.\"}"}

(2023a) to automatically annotate the corpora with genre labels. The classifier uses the following genre categories: Information/Explanation, Instruction, News, Legal, Promotion, Opinion/Argumentation, Prose/Lyrical, Forum and Other (for a detailed description of labels, refer to Kuzman et al. (2023a)). When tested in the in-dataset scenario, i.e., on the test split that is derived from the same dataset as the training data, the X-GENRE classifier achieves a micro F1 score of 0.80 and a macro F1 score of 0.79. In the cross-dataset scenario, the classifier still maintains a strong performance with a micro F1 score of 0.68 and macro F1 score of 0.69 (Kuzman et al., 2023a).\\n\\nWe applied the genre classifier to each of the seven CLASSLA-web corpora. The processing was performed on the NVIDIA A100 40GB GPU, with approximately 2,000 predictions executed per second. This resulted in a total processing time of 300 hours.\\n\\nIn addition to genre specific categories, the classifier also returns the category Other, which denotes texts that do not fit inside any of the genres present in the schema, as would be the case with an exam, interview, etc. This phenomenon is present in around 2 percent of the documents of each corpus.\\n\\nAdditionally, given that the classifier returns per-class logits that can then be transformed into class probabilities via the softmax function, we introduced a new label, Mix. This label is used in cases where none of the categories reached a probability of 0.8, which is a relatively infrequent phenomenon, affecting between 3 and 5 percent of the documents in each corpus. We have come to the decision to use the Mix label by performing a manual analysis of samples of instances with lower probabilities of the most probable label. The analysis showed that the suggested upper threshold of 0.8 isolates the documents containing multiple genres very well, with both high precision and high recall.\\n\\nTable 1 shows the distribution of documents in texts, annotated as Other or Mix, therefore the label not having a straightforward application. If we omit these labels, we can report that the X-GENRE classifier assigned a specific genre label to approximately 92%\u201396% of documents in each corpus.\\n\\nAfter annotation, we performed a manual analysis of samples from Slovenian, Croatian and Macedonian corpora. Samples consisted of 10 instances per genre label (excluding Other and Mix), amounting to 80 instances per evaluated corpus. The evaluation showed very high performance of the model, both in Latin and Cyrillic scripts, namely 0.88 in macro F1 for Croatian, 0.93 in macro F1 for Macedonian and 0.94 in macro F1 in case of Slovenian.\\n\\nLinguistic Annotation\\nThe final layer of enrichment of the original MaCoCu datasets was linguistic annotation, which enables linguistic analyses and simplified querying of the corpora through concordancers. For linguistic annotation the CLASSLA-Stanza pipeline (Ljube\u0161i\u0107 and Dobrovoljc, 2019; Ter\u010don and Ljube\u0161i\u0107, 2023) was used, which provides the state-of-the-art linguistic annotation of Slovenian, Croatian, Serbian, Bulgarian, and Macedonian.\\n\\nThe CLASSLA-Stanza pipeline is based on the Stanza neural pipeline (Qi et al., 2020), but was further improved for processing of South Slavic languages (Ter\u010don and Ljube\u0161i\u0107, 2023). Notable enhancements include the support of external inflectional lexicons, which greatly increases performance for morphologically rich languages (Ljube\u0161i\u0107 and Dobrovoljc, 2019). Additionally, the training datasets used for all models in the pipeline were expanded beyond the Universal Dependencies data. Moreover, the pipeline uses CLARIN.SI-embed word embeddings (Ter\u010don et al., 2023; Ter\u010don and Ljube\u0161i\u0107, 2023a, b, c, d) which were trained on larger and more diverse datasets compared to the embeddings used by Stanza. As a result, the CLASSLA-Stanza pipeline demonstrates superior performance compared to Stanza, with error reduction between 34% and 98% on the Slovenian official benchmark SloBENCH (\u017ditnik and Dragar, 2021) (see Ter\u010don and Ljube\u0161i\u0107 (2023) for further details).\\n\\nOne highly useful feature of the CLASSLA-Stanza pipeline is that it provides non-standard linguistic processing models for Slovenian, Croatian and Macedonian.\"}"}

These models are trained on non-standard social media texts, as well as on texts from closely related languages, such as Croatian in the case of the Serbian language, and vice versa. Furthermore, the training data used to train these models had diacritics partially removed, which is a phenomenon often seen in non-curated online texts. The CLASSLA-Stanza system includes a \u201cweb\u201d processing module that uses a standard tokenizer, but relies on non-standard models for morphosyntactic processing and lemmatization. This setup was shown to be a great solution for linguistic processing of the variety of texts that can be found online. Additionally, the flexibility of these models allows the Croatian web module to be applied to Bosnian and Montenegrin web corpora with high accuracy. Note that Bosnian and Montenegrin language can be considered, in simplified terms, a mixture of the Croatian and Serbian language (Ljube\u0161i\u0107 et al., 2018) and that the Croatian web module in CLASSLA-Stanza is capable of handling features of both. Thus, we linguistically annotated the CLASSLA-web corpora using the web module of the CLASSLA-Stanza pipeline, which is implemented as a Python library. The linguistic processing involved tokenization, morphosyntactic annotation and lemmatization. The CLASSLA-Stanza pipeline also allows annotation on the levels of dependency parsing and named entity recognition. However, these two processing stages are not supported for the Macedonian language due to the lack of required training data for that language. If the research community expresses interest for these two annotation layers in CLASSLA-web corpora for the available languages, or, even more, if appropriate training data for Macedonian are produced in the meantime, we will add these two additional annotation layers in the next version of the CLASSLA-web corpora. The final CLASSLA-web corpora have been made freely available on the CLARIN.SI repository as:\\n\\n- Bosnian CLASSLA-web.bs corpus (Ljube\u0161i\u0107 et al., 2024a)\\n- Bulgarian CLASSLA-web.bg corpus (Ljube\u0161i\u0107 et al., 2024b)\\n- Montenegrin CLASSLA-web.cnr corpus (Ljube\u0161i\u0107 et al., 2024e)\\n- Croatian CLASSLA-web.hr corpus (Ljube\u0161i\u0107 et al., 2024c)\\n- Macedonian CLASSLA-web.mk corpus (Ljube\u0161i\u0107 et al., 2024d)\\n- Slovenian CLASSLA-web.sl corpus (Ljube\u0161i\u0107 et al., 2024g)\\n- Serbian CLASSLA-web.sr corpus (Ljube\u0161i\u0107 et al., 2024f).\\n\\nThe corpora are also available on the CLARIN.SI NoSketch Engine concordancers which enable easy querying and linguistic analyses.\\n\\n### 4. CLASSLA-web Corpora\\n\\nIn this section, we perform basic analyses of the seven newly introduced corpora. In the first part, we run some general analyses on the size of each of the corpora in terms of token and document count, as well as some basic analyses of the top-level domains from which the data originate. We proceed with a genre-based analysis of the corpora, exploring the relationship between corpora as well as the relationship of specific genres within them.\\n\\n#### 4.1. General Analysis\\n\\nThe sizes of the resulting corpora for all 7 official South Slavic languages are presented in Table 2.\\n\\n| Language | Corpus Name   | Tokens       | Documents |\\n|----------|---------------|--------------|-----------|\\n|          | CLASSLA-web.sl | 2,153M       | 4,063k    |\\n|          | CLASSLA-web.hr | 2,575M       | 5,422k    |\\n|          | CLASSLA-web.bs | 802M         | 1,993k    |\\n|          | CLASSLA-web.cnr| 177M         | 401k      |\\n|          | CLASSLA-web.sr | 2,765M       | 5,256k    |\\n|          | CLASSLA-web.mk | 557M         | 1,482k    |\\n|          | CLASSLA-web.bg | 3,917M       | 7,456k    |\\n\\nThe combined corpora amount to almost 13 billion tokens of running text coming from 26 million documents. Among them, the Montenegrin web corpus is the smallest, consisting of 177 million tokens from 401 thousand documents. The largest corpus was derived from the Bulgarian web, consisting of almost 4 billion tokens, obtained from more than 7.4 million documents. Each of the presented corpora represents the largest general corpus available for the respective language. What is more, the Macedonian CLASSLA-web corpus is the first linguistically-annotated general corpus of Macedonian. This achievement was made possible not only through the crawl performed inside the MaCoCu project, but also through the linguistic annotation process.\"}"}

Genre-Based Analysis\\n\\nWe start our genre-based analysis of our seven new corpora by plotting the genre distribution in texts across these corpora in Figure 1. The first observation to be made is that genres in general are similarly distributed across all seven corpora.

Conversely, Instruction, Legal and Prose/Lyrical are the least represented, with Prose/Lyrical accounting for 1% to 4% of texts in the corpora.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the most significant disparities in genre distribution across corpora are observed in the case of Promotion and News.

(2022) played a crucial role by collecting the corpora based on a comprehensive crawl of the national top-level domains and well-interconnected general domains. Additionally, the project implemented various post-processing methods to ensure the high quality of the final datasets. Notably, that research highlighted the significant challenges associated with language identification of less prevalent languages, especially between closely-related South Slavic languages, such as the mutually intelligible Croatian, Bosnian, Montenegrin and Serbian languages.\\n\\nSecondly, high-quality linguistic annotation of the CLASSLA-web corpora was made possible by recent improvements of the CLASSLA-Stanza pipeline (Ter\u010don and Ljube\u0161i\u0107, 2023). In addition to improving annotation accuracy with extended training datasets and embeddings, the new version of CLASSLA-Stanza pipeline provides a \u201cweb\u201d module, specifically tailored for linguistic annotation of web corpora. This is particularly advantageous, as web corpora pose a unique challenge to linguistic processing pipelines due to their composition of standard and non-standard texts. What is even more, while Bosnian and Montenegrin do exhibit combinations of linguistic features that distinguish them from Croatian and Serbian, most of these features are covered either in the one or the other language training data, enabling for the Croatian \u201cweb\u201d module, trained on standard and non-standard datasets of both Croatian and Serbian, to very successfully annotate the Bosnian and Montenegrin CLASSLA-web corpora. Linguistic annotation facilitates comprehensive analyses of language phenomena for corpus linguists, who perform analyses based on part-of-speech and other linguistic information.\\n\\nThirdly, we applied to the corpora a recently-developed multilingual genre classifier. This automatic annotation with genre categories allowed us to enrich the datasets with valuable information on the communicative function of documents inside the seven corpora. Our findings demonstrate that the CLASSLA-web corpora exhibit similar genre distributions. However, we observed that certain corpora, such as Bosnian, Montenegrin, and Macedonian, predominantly consist of news content. In contrast, the Slovenian corpus contains a smaller proportion of news content, with promotional texts representing a significant portion of the corpus. In future research, we plan to significantly extend explorations of genres inside the CLASSLA-web corpora. Firstly, we plan to perform manual analysis on all 7 languages to ascertain what is the overall performance of the multilingual genre classifier on each of the corpora. Secondly, we will investigate possible patterns of bases that could negatively impact downstream research relying on genre labels obtained from multilingual models. Finally, we plan to use genre information to analyze the linguistic characteristics of genres in South Slavic web corpora.\\n\\nGiven the substantial sizes of the CLASSLA-web corpora, they are immensely valuable for the development of language technologies for South Slavic languages and future linguistic analyses. The corpora are already being used for the development of BERT-like and generative pretrained (GPT) language models specific to South Slavic languages. Furthermore, the data can be useful as the starting point for development of manually-annotated training data for numerous tasks. For instance, as part of the Slovenian EMMA project focused on providing NLP solutions to the media industry, samples of the texts annotated as News are planned to be used for development of datasets for multilingual topic prediction in news. Moreover, the corpora are highly useful for linguistic analyses as was already shown by their predecessors slWaC, hrWaC (Ljube\u0161i\u0107 and Erjavec, 2011), srWaC (Ljube\u0161i\u0107 and Klubi\u010dka, 2014) and others. Accordingly, we have made the corpora available through the CLARIN.SI concordancers as well, to enable easy corpus querying. To promote their use in the wider linguistic community, which also includes language teachers and digital humanists, the use of the corpora through concordancers will be presented in CLASSLA Express, a series of five workshops that will take place in four South Slavic countries.\"}"}

We have already started performing a new run of crawling for Slovenian, Croatian, Serbian, Bosnian and Montenegrin, which will be followed by crawling of Bulgarian and Macedonian. This will allow us to further expand and update the current version of the CLASSLA-web corpora. Consistent updating the corpora will also enable research on how the texts and their distribution on the web are evolving through time, and also enable research in the field of semantic change for South Slavic languages. Additionally, by presenting this process in this paper, we aim to inspire similar initiatives to develop web corpora for other languages lacking large high-quality corpora.\\n\\nAcknowledgments\\n\\nThe research presented in this paper was conducted within the research project \u201cBasic Research for the Development of Spoken Language Resources and Speech Technologies for the Slovenian Language\u201d (J7-4642), the research project \u201cEmbeddings-based techniques for Media Monitoring Applications\u201d (L2-50070, co-funded by the Kliping d.o.o. agency) and within the research programme \u201cLanguage resources and technologies for Slovene\u201d (P6-0411), all funded by the Slovenian Research and Innovation Agency (ARIS).\\n\\nThis work has received funding from the European Union\u2019s Connecting Europe Facility 2014-2020 - CEF Telecom, under Grant Agreement No. INEA/CEF/ICT/A2020/2278341.

Ethical Considerations and Limitations\\n\\nWe are aware that using data that was collected from the web can raise questions of respecting the intellectual property and privacy rights of the original authors of the texts. The authors of the MaCoCu datasets, on which the CLASSLA-web corpora are based on, assured that no sensitive data would be included by only collecting the texts that were freely accessible. Nevertheless, we are aware that the datasets might still include some texts that the authors do not consent to be included. To mitigate this, the CLASSLA-web corpora are published with a notice, which informs the authors of the text that the texts can be taken out of the corpora upon their request.\\n\\nBibliographical References\\n\\nMarta Ba\u00f1\u00f3n, Miquel Espl\u00e0-Gomis, Mikel L Forcada, Cristian Garc\u00eda-Romero, Taja Kuzman, Nikola Ljube\u0161i\u0107, Rik van Noord, Leopoldo Pla Sempere, Gema Ram\u00edrez-S\u00e1nchez, Peter Rupnik, et al. 2022.
