However, there has been little focus on dialogue research on quantitatively analyzing the effects of the quality and quantity of subjective information contained in dialogues on group performance. We hypothesize that the more subjective information interlocutors exchange, the better the group performance in collaborative work. We collected dialogues between drivers and engineers in motorsports when deciding how the car should be tuned as a suitable case to verify this hypothesis. Our analysis suggests that the greater the amount of subjective information (which we defined as \\\"sensation\\\") in the driver's utterances, the greater the race performance and driver satisfaction with the car's tuning. The results indicate that it is essential for the development of dialogue research to create a corpus of situations that require high performance through collaboration among experts with different backgrounds but who have mastered their respective fields.\\n\\nKeywords: Sensation, Collaborative Dialogue, Group Performance\\n\\n1. Introduction\\nHumans are social creatures and share their innermost thoughts through dialogue. The active use of subjective ideas is essential to develop a dialogue system that improves mutual understanding and creativity among humans. Since subjective ideas often contain ambiguity, it is conceivable that poor comprehension conditions could lead to confusion or misdirection within the group. Understanding subjective information is also more difficult when the positions and roles of the interlocutors differ. Therefore, we examined the effect of conveying subjective ideas among people in different positions and roles on group performance during collaborative work.\\n\\nFor such verification, it is essential to have a dialogue resource where several people collaboratively work and actively express their subjective ideas for solving problems that cannot be solved from objective facts alone. An example of such a rare dialogue is between drivers and engineers in motorsports. Group performance in motorsports can be replaced with race performance. Motorsport gives a limited amount of test-driving time before a race. The driver and engineer discuss whether the car is tuned appropriately for the track conditions on the basis of the driver's sensations and decide the optimal tuning. We defined \\\"sensation\\\" as a unique event unfolding in the mind of a speaker, i.e., the driver. In this situation, two experts who have mastered their respective fields can finally solve a problem by agreeing on the same idea.\\n\\nProfessional racing drivers can accurately control their cars under extreme conditions (Reid and Lightfoot, 2019; Reid, 2022), under which the maximum speed of the car can reach over 300 km/h. They exhibit different neuroscientific (Bernardi et al., 2013), cognitive (Land and Tatler, 2001; Lappi, 2022), and sensorimotor (Van Leeuwen et al., 2017; Nishizono et al., 2023) characteristics while driving than non-racing drivers. They can understand the increase or decrease in lap time in 0.05-s increments, depending on how good or bad their driving is.\\n\\nThe dialogue we focus on has the following four advantages from the perspective of research execution.\\n\\n\u2022 High Resolution - High-resolution sensations that cannot be expressed through basic emotion classification are expressed.\\n\u2022 Reproducibility - The same person has the same feeling when placed in the same situation.\\n\u2022 Evaluability - Some indicators can be used to evaluate the results of sensation transfer objectively.\\n\u2022 Availability - Sufficient data are available to identify the characteristics of human communication.\\n\\nAlthough many language resources have been reported (Scherer and Wallbott, 1994; Gon\u00e7alo Oliveira et al., 2022; Dong et al., 2018; \\nhttps://orientstar-watch.com/blogs/articles/blog11 (Japanese article, accessed March 19, 2024)\"}"}

We investigated the impact of the differences in the following driver's utterances on race performance by using dialogues with these advantages.\\n\\n- \u300c\u30b3\u30fc\u30ca\u30fc\u304c\u3001\u3061\u3087\u3063\u3068\u6c17\u306b\u306a\u308b\u300d\\n  \u201cI\u2019m a little concerned about the corner.\u201d\\n- \u300c\u30b3\u30fc\u30ca\u30fc\u306e\u51fa\u53e3\u3067\u3001\u5510\u7a81\u306b\u3001\u30ea\u30a2\u304c\u3086\u3063\u304f\u308a\u6ed1\u308b\u300d\\n  \u201cSuddenly, the rear end slides slowly on the exit of a corner.\u201d\\n\\nThese are expressions by which the driver attempts to convey the car\u2019s condition as they perceive it. From an emotional viewpoint, both utterances may be categorized as \u201cdisgust,\u201d and it is difficult to distinguish between them. However, comparing these two utterances in terms of the resolution of the specific event, the latter expresses the sensation of corner driving in more detail and contributes more to group performance than the former.\\n\\nWe consider the detailing and sharing of sensations as the essence of dialogue and verified this in this study. We refer to \u201csensation\u201d as the specific event in the speaker\u2019s mind. A person who has mastered something can have a high-resolution sensation of the related event that they have mastered (Yarrow et al., 2009). The contributions of this study can be summarized as follows.\\n\\n- To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study in which dialogue results, which are mainly subjective exchanges, were evaluated both subjectively by the speaker and objectively through group performance.\\n- We collected and analyzed dialogues for the domain of \u201cmotorsports.\u201d\\n- In a dialogue corpus consisting mainly of subjective exchanges between people in different positions, the results of the analysis suggest that when the speaker\u2019s utterance contains many sensation words, the speaker\u2019s satisfaction and objective performance of the competition improve.\\n- The verification results suggest that it is essential for the development of dialogue research to create a corpus of situations in which experts with different backgrounds who have mastered their respective fields collaborate and perform at a high level.\\n\\nThis study also contributes to the sporting genre of motorsports. The verification results suggest the importance of the quality of dialogue between drivers and engineers in the sport, where almost all efforts to improve race performance have been based on analysis of the mechanical characteristics of the car (Milliken et al., 1995). There are attempts to improve driver performance physically (Lappi, 2018). The verification results in this study indicate the possibility of improving race performance through dialogue intervention.\\n\\n2. Related Work\\n\\n2.1. Emotion-Text Corpus\\n\\nOur goal was to quantitatively evaluate the sensations contained in utterances. Emotion and sentiment have been widely used as general indicators of the internal states of humans.\\n\\nOne of the most widely used corpora that combines text and emotion is the ISEAR dataset (Scherer and Wallbott, 1994). This dataset is a collection of emotionally evocative texts to which annotators assigned seven labels (Joy, Fear, Anger, Sadness, Disgust, Shame, and Guilt), which are an extension of Ekman\u2019s six basic emotions (Ekman, 1992). The data were obtained from approximately 3,000 respondents in 37 countries. The dataset is intended to infer average and objective human emotions toward text, thus does not record high-resolution sensations.\\n\\nMost of the available corpora have an unspecified person as the source of the text (Gon\u00e7alo Oliveira et al., 2022), e.g., through crowdsourcing. Some corpora contain sensations in the collected utterances by restricting the provider\u2019s characteristics. Dong et al. (2018); Zhong and Huang (2018) confirmed that the Chinese have unique linguistic expressions that signify distinctive tastes. EmoryNLP (Zahiri and Choi, 2018) contains data collected from dialogues between TV drama actors. The words spoken in the TV dramas were selected by a scriptwriter, an expert in handling words. The utterances that contain sensations are similar to the dialogues collected in this study. However, the collected utterances are not subjective expressions, and the annotated information is limited to six categories in the emotional layer.\\n\\nAnjaria and Guddeti (2014) collected texts posted on Twitter (now known as X) about a specific election and constructed a corpus with three sentiment labels (Positive, Negative, and Neutral) assigned to each text. The senders of the texts had subjective\"}"}

Collaborative Dialogue\\n\\nNarayan-Chen et al. (2019) used Minecraft and set up a task in which one dialogue participant, who knew the correct structure to build, instructed the other dialogue participant to do the work. In such a task, conveying objective information on the basis of the correct answer rather than subjective ideas in the dialogue will likely improve performance as a group.\\n\\nIchikawa and Higashinaka (2022) also used Minecraft and tasked dialogue participants with building a garden that they thought would be good for them. This study used a creative task with no correct answer. However, the dialogue participants were not necessarily gardening experts and did not convey high-resolution, reproducible sensations.\\n\\nWillemsen et al. (2022) used a sorting game, a task in which dialogue participants sort multiple images on the basis of a rationale. The study focused on objectively recording the relationship between visual references and utterances. The collected dialogues were based on objective visual information and did not include much of the speaker's sensations.\\n\\nOkahisa et al. (2022) collected dialogues from interviews that actively elicited knowledge from professionals. However, the study focused on the mechanisms by which the interviewer elicits knowledge from the interviewee and did not evaluate the dialogue results regarding group performance.\\n\\n2.3. Social Decision-making\\n\\nResearchers in social decision-making have investigated the relationship between dialogue and group performance. Bahrami et al. (2010) asked two participants to identify low-order visual stimuli using a Gabor patch (a simple visual pattern used in perceptual experiments). They found that the percentage of correct responses was higher when communication between them was allowed than when not. The effect was verified on the basis of the dichotomous value of whether dialogue occurred. The dialogues contained rough granularity information about whether the participants saw the target stimulus. Although the study showed a relationship between the presence or absence of dialogue and performance, it did not clarify the relationship with dialogue quality.\\n\\nTohyama and Shirouzu (2018) analyzed the characteristics of dialogue when children solve mathematics problems while discussing them. They concluded that clarifying the meaning of numbers and expressions given as problems through dialogue increases the percentage of correct answers. They showed that the quality of dialogue affects group performance. However, there were textbook solutions and correct answers to a given task. Accurately understanding objective facts rather than subjective information leads to improved group performance.\\n\\n3.

Super Formula is the highest motorsports category in Japan. Since the drivers and engineers who were the targets of the dialogue collection have achieved a certain level of continuous success in Super Formula, they are equipped with a wealth of knowledge to win races. Since the drivers and engineers belong to the same team and handle the same specifications of cars, they equally share a certain amount of knowledge and skills.\\n\\nA round of Super Formula consists of free practice, a qualifying race, and a final race. During the time between free practice and the start of the qualifying race, engineers tune the car to run as fast as possible. One of the factors used by the engineers to determine the car's condition is the driver's comments after driving the car during the free practice.\"}"}

Table 1 lists the statistics of the collected dialogues. We refer to the two drivers as Driver 1 and Driver 2 and refer to Driver 1(2)\u2019s interlocutor as Engineer 1(2).\\n\\n3.1. Qualitative Characteristics of Collected Dialogues\\n\\nWe present a case in which the sensations contained in the utterances of the collected dialogues significantly affected the race results. Figure 1 shows the dialogues between the two pairs of drivers and engineers before the same final race. The horizontal axis represents time, and the utterances of the drivers and engineers are shown in chronological order. Utterances expressing dissatisfaction with the car\u2019s condition are shown in red. The drivers and engineers had discussions about determining the optimal tuning until the start of the race.\\n\\nFor the upper pair of Figure 1, Driver 2 repeatedly uses the same informative word, \u201cdizzy.\u201d He also utters, \u201cI don\u2019t know what to do,\u201d which contains almost no sensations. These words provide little information for Engineer 2 to make effective tuning decisions. Therefore, the race result was weak.\\n\\nFor the lower pair, Driver 1 reported the car\u2019s condition in a more detailed and multifaceted manner than Driver 2, such as \u201cslips out a little,\u201d \u201cslip quite abruptly,\u201d and \u201ca left corner.\u201d Driver 1 provided more information for Engineer 1 to decide on the car\u2019s tuning than Driver 2. Therefore, the race result was stronger.\\n\\nOn the basis of the relationship between the qualitative characteristics of the dialogue and race performance, we hypothesized that the more the driver verbalizes sensations about the car\u2019s condition, the more likely the engineer will have more information to make decisions to improve the condition. Therefore, the better the car performs as the driver hoped, the better the race performance. We conducted a quantitative verification of this hypothesis, as discussed in the next section.\\n\\n4. Verification of Effect of Sensation Amount on Race Performance\\n\\nThe hypothesis described in the previous section was verified by decomposing it into the subjective satisfaction of the drivers and objective race performance. Among the dialogues collected (for five rounds), we sampled the dialogues during the free practice and qualifying race for three of the rounds (Rds. A, B, and C) for verification. We excluded the other two rounds from the verification because those rounds had no free practices. We also excluded the final race from the analysis. The qualifying race is a time attack, and the final race is for the finishing order. The competitors easily influence the results of the final race. Therefore, we adopted the qualifying race time as an appropriate indicator of race performance to verify our hypothesis described in Section 4.5.\\n\\nFor quantitative verification, we defined the amount of sensations in the driver\u2019s utterance as the information score. There are three different information scores depending on how it is calculated.\\n\\n4.1. Calculation of Information Score using Term Frequency-inverse Document Frequency\\n\\nThe first information score, denoted as $I_{\\\\text{score-T}}$, is quantitatively defined as\\n\\n$$ I_{\\\\text{score-T}} = \\\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\\\text{TF-IDF}_i, $$\\n\\nwhere $n$ represents the total number of morphemes within all utterances of the driver in the specified dialogue segment. Here, $\\\\text{TF-IDF}_i$ is term-frequency-inverse-document-frequency (TF-IDF) for the $i$th morpheme. The TF-IDF (Salton and McGill, 1983) is a measure of the importance of a morpheme in a document and used as an indicator of textual emotion classification (Cahyani and Patasik, 2021). It is calculated as the product of the number of occurrences of a morpheme in a document (TF) and the log of the value obtained by dividing the total number of documents by the number of documents in which the morpheme appears (DF).

The number of documents used to calculate DF was 89, consisting of 38 documents of all the dialogue data of the two pairs of drivers and engineers for all 5 rounds and 51 documents of group-task dialogue data unrelated to motorsports. The TF-IDF of words unique to motorsports is calculated higher, while that of words commonly used in daily conversation is calculated lower by adding group-task dialogues.\\n\\nWe used MeCab (Kudo, 2005) as a library for morphological analysis of utterances and used mecab-ipadic-NEologd (Sato, 2015) as a system dictionary within MeCab. If many morphemes with small TF-IDFs are contained in the morphemes used to calculate the I score-T, morphemes with large TF-IDFs will have less weight in this I score-T, and the amount of sensations in the utterance will not be represented appropriately. For example, even if a person speaks a clerical utterance at length that contains many objective facts with a small amount of sensations, the I score-T will be large. Therefore, morphemes with a DF of 50 or more, which is more than the majority of the total number of documents, were excluded from the TF-IDF calculation.\\n\\nTable 2 (a) lists the top 20 morphemes of TF-IDF of all the utterances of Driver 1 during Rd. B, and Table 2 (b) lists the bottom 20 morphemes of TF-IDF. Table 2 (a) contains many morphemes expressing the parts and condition of the car, and Table 2 (b) contains more general terms and fillers that are less related to the car's condition than those in Table 2 (a). Thus, the TF-IDF can extract the desired morphemes, and the I score-T is appropriate as an indicator of the amount of sensations.\\n\\n### Table 2: Top 20 (a) and bottom 20 (b) morphemes of TF-IDF in all utterances of Driver 1 in Rd.

Verification and Results with Subjective Evaluation Values\\n\\nWe conducted a subjective evaluation to verify our hypothesis. Between free practice and the start of the qualifying race, the drivers and engineers update the car's tuning by repeating the following three-step cycle as time permits.\\n\\n1. Test driving\\n2. Feedback on car's condition\\n3. Consideration and determination of tunings\\n\\nThe feedback of the car's condition provided by the driver in Step 2 has two roles: to evaluate the tuning determined in the previous cycle and provide sensations that can be used to decide how to improve the tuning. If our hypothesis holds, the greater the amount of sensations the driver verbalizes in one cycle, the greater the driver's satisfaction with the tuning will be in the next cycle. To verify this, we calculated driver satisfaction with the tunings for each cycle.\\n\\nTable 4 lists the perspectives the drivers used to evaluate the cars' conditions. These perspectives were confirmed by interviewing the engineers whose dialogues were collected and generally covered what the drivers were concerned about. For the driver's utterance in Step 2 (Feedback on car's condition), one of the authors rated the car's performance from each of the 11 perspectives on a 5-point scale from 1 to 5 (the higher the rating, the higher the driver's evaluation). For example, if the driver said, \\\"losing traction,\\\" the author assigned 1 as the evaluation value of traction. Since the driver did not mention all the 11 perspectives in each cycle, a uniform evaluation value of 3 was given to those not mentioned. We define the average of the evaluation values of the 11 perspectives for each cycle as the driver's satisfaction for the cycle.\\n\\nWe verified our hypothesis by using driver satisfaction and the three information scores introduced in Sections 4.1 to 4.3. If the hypothesis holds, the information scores in one cycle would positively correlate with the driver-satisfaction gain in the next cycle. The driver-satisfaction gain represents the increase or decrease in driver satisfaction compared with the previous cycle. If the satisfaction in cycle t refers to $S(t)$, Equation 4 expresses the satisfaction gain $\\\\Delta S$ as\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\Delta S = S(t) - S(t-1)\\n$$\\n\\n4.4.1.

The $I_{score-S}$ analysis also indicated a statistically significant positive correlation, with $r = 0.464$ and a 95% CI of [0.187, 0.673]. Similarly, the $I_{score-B}$ results showed a significant positive correlation, with $r = 0.518$ and a 95% CI of [0.254, 0.710].\\n\\nFigure 3 shows the $I_{score-T}$ and Driver 2's satisfaction per cycle in $R_{ds}$ B.

Verification and Results with Objective Evaluation Values\\n\\nWe then verified the effect of the amount of sensations in a driver's utterance on race performance. We needed to score the results of the qualifying races for this verification. Since motorsports are not always held on the same course, using race time as an indicator would make it impossible to separate whether the car's condition or course-related factors, such as course length and difficulty, affects the time.\\n\\nTo remove course-related factors, we therefore used the ratio of the target driver's time to the time of the driver who placed first in the qualifying race to measure race performance, as shown in Equation 5. We refer to this ratio as the time score. The time score is between 0 and 1, with a higher score indicating better race performance.

Discussion\\n\\n5.1. Case Study for Verification Results\\n\\nThe results of the subjective and objective verifications in the previous section support our hypothesis.

Driver 1 expressed that there was no concern regarding the car\u2019s condition, such as \u201cnot bad\u201d or \u201cnot feel at all\u201d from the beginning. Furthermore, \u201cas expected\u201d or \u201cno negatives\u201d just before the race indicated that he had no complaints about the car\u2019s condition. The result was excellent, placing first out of 10. On the basis of these utterances and the race results, this sample can be interpreted as follows. Since the car was in perfect condition from the beginning, Driver 1 had little sensation to improve the car\u2019s condition, and the race result was excellent.\\n\\nThe verification results in Section 4 and the two case studies described above support our hypothesis. However, we must carefully determine the cause-and-effect relationship by considering the initial condition of the car, actual utterances, and the environment. The same trend as our hypothesis will appear, particularly when cars still need a large amount of tuning.\\n\\n5.2. Differences in Results with Method of Calculating Information Scores\\n\\nRegarding the verification results in Section 4, the I score-T did not differ significantly from the I score-S and I score-B for the correlation coefficient. Thus, the TF-IDF reflects human subjectivity. The purpose of using BERT in Section 4.3 was to extract latent subjective keywords that humans are unaware of and reflect them in the information score. As expected, the correlation coefficient between the I score-B and driver-satisfaction gain exceeded I score-T and I score-S, as described in Section 4.4. BERT also extracted words that were not included in the correct set of subjective keywords but should be included. Two examples are shown below. Words in the driver\u2019s utterances that were not included in the set of subjective keywords but inferred with BERT are shown in bold.\\n\\n\u2022 \u300c\u306a\u3093\u304b\u305a\u30fc\u3063\u3068\u30d5\u30ed\u30f3\u30c8\u304c\u3075\u308f\u3075\u308f\u3075\u308f\u3075\u308f\u305a\u3063\u3068\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u306e\u304c\u6c17\u306b\u306a\u308b\u3093\u3067\u3059\u3088\u306d\u300d\\n  \u201cI feel like the front end is fluffy and fluffy all the time.\u201d\\n\\n\u2022 \u300c\u30bf\u30a4\u30e4\u304c\u52d5\u3044\u3066\u3044\u308b\u304b\u3089\u306a\u306e\u304b\u3001\u3046\u30fc\u3093\u3001\u53ce\u307e\u308a\u304c\u3059\u3054\u3044\u60aa\u3044\u300d\\n  \u201cMaybe it\u2019s because the tires are moving, umm, it\u2019s ill-fitting.\u201d\\n\\nThe words \u201cfluffy\u201d and \u201cfitting\u201d inferred with BERT are essential expressions for the car\u2019s tuning. These words convey to the engineer the subtle nuances of the driver\u2019s experience. Although the training data set used for BERT fine-tuning was small (1157 sentences), the above examples suggest that automatic extraction of sensations may be feasible with accuracy exceeding that of humans by enhancing the training data.\\n\\n5.3. Influence of Utterance Length and Driver Personality Traits\\n\\nThe longer the utterance, the more sensations it is considered to contain. However, as the time available to speak in a race is limited and drivers try to speak as much as possible in that limited time, we consider that the length of utterances varies little between drivers. Relatedly, each driver is potentially chatty or reserved as an innate human trait. However, in professional motorsports, the influence of the number of words spoken as a personality trait is small. For drivers, their honor, life, and livelihood are at stake in a race. To drive the car as fast as possible, drivers speak up without hesitation about anything bothering them. We have also heard from the engineer from whom we collected dialogues that \u201cdrivers will point out anything they feel like pointing out without hesitation.\u201d\\n\\n5.4. Correlation between Driver\u2019s Satisfaction and Performance\\n\\nTo reinforce the verification described in Section 4, analyzing the correlation between driver satisfaction and performance.\"}"}

How-\\never, analyzing this relationship during free prac-\\ntices is difficult because drivers do not always drive\\nat full speed (sometimes they dare to meander to\\ncheck grip). Once we have collected enough data\\nwith the car running at full speed during free prac-\\ntices, we will work on verifying this correlation.\\n\\n6. Summary and Future Work\\n\\nWe defined \u201csensation\u201d as a unique event unfolding\\nin a speaker\u2019s mind, and clarified that the amount\\nof a speaker\u2019s sensations in their utterances during\\ncollaborative work contributes to improving group\\nperformance. We collected dialogues on motor-\\nsports, a rare situation in which multiple top profes-\\nsionals collaboratively work and actively exchange\\ntheir innermost thoughts. As a result of the obser-\\nvation of the collected dialogues, we hypothesized\\nthat the more sensations the driver provides about\\nthe car\u2019s condition, the more the engineers can\\nmake decisions to improve the condition. Therefore,\\nthe more the car\u2019s condition meets the driver\u2019s sat-\\nisfaction, the more race performance is improved.\\n\\nWe scored the sensations of the driver\u2019s utterances,\\nsatisfaction, and race performance to verify our\\nhypothesis. The correlation coefficients between\\neach score and the case studies support this hy-\\npothesis.\\n\\nWe analyzed dialogues from two drivers in three\\nrounds. Augmenting the data set from more drivers\\nand rounds is a top priority for future work for sta-\\ntistically reliable confirmation.\\n\\nWe also need to consider more plausible meth-\\nods of sensation calculation. The main focus of this\\nstudy was to verify whether there is a correlation be-\\ntween sensation and performance. To do this, we\\nscored sensations as scalar quantities using basic\\nmethods such as TF-IDF, the number of subjective\\nkeywords, and BERT, as mentioned in Section 4.\\n\\nWhen discussing the degree of effectiveness in the\\nfuture, it will be worthwhile to scrutinize multiple\\nmethods. Also, collecting sufficient data will enable\\nus to express sensations in richer formats, such as\\nvector representations.\\n\\n6.1. Application to Support\\n\\nCommunication\\n\\nThe information score can be used to evaluate the\\nextent to which the speaker\u2019s sensations are in-\\ncluded in the text, in the context of text genera-\\ntion (Brown et al., 2020) and textual intent estima-\\ntion (Frank and Goodman, 2012). For example, one\\napplication of the findings of this study could sug-\\ngest questions to the engineer to elicit the driver\u2019s\\nsensations.\\n\\nAs mentioned in Section 1, ambiguities in sen-\\nsations may cause confusion among interlocutors\\nor lead a group in the wrong direction. Particularly\\nin motorsports, many digital sensors are installed\\nto measure the car\u2019s precise conditions. Relying\\nsolely on these sensors\u2019 data without the driver\u2019s\\nsensations would result in accurate tuning. Never-\\ntheless, our verification results suggest that driver\u2019s\\nsensations improve race performance and driver\u2019s\\nsatisfaction. Humans can be highly excellent sen-\\nsors with a resolution surpassing digital sensors.\\nThey can also be decoders capable of accurately\\nconveying the sensations. This study aimed to\\nachieve communication-support technology that\\nwill strengthen top professionals and create a world\\nwhere people who met yesterday and today can\\ncommunicate as if they were old friends who have\\nknown each other for ten years.\\n\\n7. Limitations\\n\\nIt remains to be discussed whether the findings\\nobtained in this study can be applied to other col-\\nlaborative dialogues. We considered that the same\\ntrends as the hypotheses verified in Section 3.1\\nwill appear for interactions between high-resolution\\nand reproducible sensation holders. Experts (e.g.,\\nprofessional athletes) who have mastered a spe-\\ncific field, not limited to motorsports, possess high-\\nresolution and reproducible sensations (Yarrow\\net al., 2009). How abundantly such experts\u2019 sen-\\nsations can be shared with others will help im-\\nprove group performance and creativity. Verifying\\nwhether this hypothesis holds for other use cases\\nis for future work. Since the speakers in this study\\nwere top professionals with precise sensations, the\\nverification results may have supported our hypoth-\\nthesis. If the sensations were incorrect or not re-\\nproducible (e.g., novices or amateurs), conveying\\nthem would have worsened group performance.\\n\\nBahrami et al. (2010) reported that when two peo-\\nple with different abilities work cooperatively while\\ninteracting, their performance tends to be worse\\nthan when they work alone. In contrast, their perfor-\\nmance improves when their abilities are equal. In\\nthis study, although the speakers\u2019 roles (i.e., driver\\nand engineer) were different, as described in Sec-\\ntion 3, they were equally capable of understanding\\nthe car\u2019s condition. Therefore, the verification re-\\nsults are consistent with those reported in a previ-\\nous study (Bahrami et al., 2010).\\n\\nThere may be collaborative work in which per-\\nformance is improved by conveying only objective\\nfacts (e.g., solving mathematics problems). Note\\nthat the scope of the present study was limited to\\nresearch subjects that satisfy the four advantages\\ndescribed in Section 1.\"}"}
