We describe this process by first presenting the criteria guiding the balanced selection of the newly added data and the challenges encountered when merging language resources with divergent designs, followed by the presentation of other major enhancements of the new Gos corpus, such as improvements in lemmatization and morphosyntactic annotation, word-level speech alignment, a new XML schema and the development of a specialized online concordancer.\\n\\nKeywords: spoken corpus, speech database, corpus compilation, corpus annotation, Slovenian language\\n\\n1. Introduction\\nSpoken corpora, transcribed and annotated collections of spoken language recordings, are a vital resource for linguistic research and language technology development. They provide authentic, real-world linguistic data, essential for improving speech recognition, dialogue systems, and our understanding of human communication in general. For Slovenian language in particular, a South Slavic language with 2 million speakers, the first reference corpus of spoken Slovenian, known as Gos, was initially released in 2011, containing approximately 113 hours (1 million transcribed words) of spontaneous speech in various everyday situations, carefully balanced according to discourse type, domain, channel and speaker demographics (Zwitter Vitez et al., 2013; Verdonik et al., 2013). Although Gos has played a pivotal role in advancing linguistic research of spoken Slovenian (Verdonik and Mau\u010dec, 2017; Dobrovoljc, 2017) and the development of language resources for Slovenian in general (e.g., Dobrovoljc and Nivre, 2016; Fi\u0161er et al., 2020; Verdonik, 2023), it has not undergone significant expansions or improvements over time, and remained relatively small when compared to reference spoken corpora available for other languages (Love et al., 2017; Dobrushina, 2022).\\n\\nTo address this gap and establish a stronger empirical basis for future linguistic investigations of spoken Slovenian, we have recently created an extended and enhanced version of the Gos corpus as part of the project Development of Slovenian in a Digital Environment (DSDE). We present the results of this activity in the continuation of this paper by describing the newly added data (Section 2) and its unification (Section 3), the improvements in lemmatization and tagging (Section 4), addition of word-level speech alignment information (Section 5), a new version of the TEI schema (Section 6), and the development of a new online concordancer (Section 7).\\n\\n1. https://rsdo.slovenscina.eu/\\n\\n2. Data selection\\nEfforts to compile speech databases aimed at training automatic speech recognition systems (e.g. Kibria et al. 2022) often run in parallel with the creation of reference speech corpora intended for linguistic research (e.g. Love et. al., 2017; Schmidt, 2022; Kop\u0159ivov\u00e1 et al., 2017). Despite their separate objectives, both communities share the common goal of seeking high-quality speech recordings and transcriptions across diverse contexts. In line with this, there is a growing body of work leveraging the same data for both technology development and linguistic research (Schuppler et al.; 2017), especially in low-resource communities that are unable to meet substantial investments required to develop large-scale speech corpora.\\n\\nThis was also the motivation behind expanding the Gos reference corpus Slovenian through the inclusion of data from two ASR-oriented speech databases: Gos VideoLectures (Verdonik, 2018) and Artur (Verdonik et al., 2022). Among other databases available for spoken Slovenian (Miheli\u010d et al., 2003; \u017dgank et al., 2014), these were selected due to their adherence to our initial criteria to capture (1) authentic spoken situations (no read texts), which (2) have undergone manual transcription or transcription accuracy checks, and (3) are freely accessible for public use. The result of these efforts is a unified resource with improved lemmatization and tagging, which is made available to the linguistic community through a new web concordancer, and is therefore much easier to access and use than separate, diverse datasets.\\n\\n2.1 Gos VideoLectures\\nGos VideoLectures is a corpus of 22 hours of audio recordings of academic speech aimed at training continuous speech recognition in the Slovenian language, facilitating phonetic research, and supporting research on Slovenian academic discourse in general. As implied by the name, the\"}"}

This resulted in the Artur ASR database with transcriptions (Verdonik et al., 2023b) and recordings (Verdonik et al., 2023a) that comprise approximately 500 hours of read sentences, 200 hours of parliamentary speech with manual transcription, and 300 hours of recordings from public and private settings, 100 of which include manual transcriptions.\\n\\nTo ensure that Gos remains a balanced and representative reference corpus of spontaneous speech, only a selection of transcriptions was included in Gos 2, namely all 62 hours of transcribed recordings of public events (conferences, workshops, round tables, interviews, education videos etc.), all 61 hours of transcribed private events (monologue descriptions or explanations, free dialogue conversations), and a 62-hour subset of transcribed parliamentary speech.\\n\\nData integration and unification was performed on transcriptions only. Audio files remained the same as in the original data releases (VideoLectures.NET, 2019; Verdonik et al., 2023a). For the Gos 1 subcorpus, audio files have legal restrictions for public use. They can be listened to through the web concordancer, but not freely downloaded as is the case with the Artur and the Gos Videolectures audio files.\\n\\nAs shown in Table 1, extending the original Gos 1 corpus with new data from the two resources described above resulted in a significant improvement of the corpus with respect to size and the diversity of speakers and speech events, which, in addition to the 2004-2010 recording period of the Gos 1 corpus, now also include recordings and topics from the period up to 2022.\\n\\nAs shown in Table 2, Gos 2 also maintains the speech event diversity and balance of the Gos 1 corpus with respect to public and non-public speech, however, with the inclusion of the new data from Gos VideoLectures and Artur, Gos 2 introduces a larger bias towards public speech settings. Authentic private dialogues and multilogues, as well as non-private interactions occurring at workplace, service-related contexts, and sales, remain unique to Gos 1 subset and thus represent a smaller share of Gos 2 corpus in comparison to its predecessor.\\n\\n| Events         | Speakers | Hours | Words     |\\n|----------------|----------|-------|-----------|\\n| Gos 1          | 287      | 1,560 | 112,035   |\\n| Gos VL         | 55       | 90    | 22,178    |\\n| Artur          | 1        | 1,192 | 532       |\\n| Gos 2          | 1,534    | 2,182 | 319,246   |\\n\\nTable 1: The size of the new Gos 2 corpus and its subsets with respect to the number of speech events and speakers, the length of the recordings and the number of words transcribed.\\n\\n| Interaction Type | No. of words in thousands | % |\\n|-----------------|---------------------------|---|\\n| Public          | 166                       | 7  |\\n| TV, informative broadcast | 10     | 4  |\\n| TV, entertaining show | 10     | 4  |\\n| Radio talk or show | 11     | 5  |\\n| Radio interview | 252                       | 10 |\\n| Public event    | 29                        | 5  |\\n| Lecture         | 22                        | 9  |\\n| School lesson   | 111                       | 5  |\\n| Parliament      | 46                        | 19 |\\n| Non-public non-private | 16     | 7  |\\n| Workplace or education | 86     | 4  |\\n| Services        | 5                         | 1  |\\n| Sales           | 1                         | 1  |\\n| Non-public private | 632                  | 26 |\\n| Monologue       | 213                       | 9  |\\n| Dialogue or multilogue | 419                   | 17 |\\n| Total           | 2,400,000                 | 100|\\n\\nTable 2: The structure of Gos 2 according to interaction types.\"}"}

It features shorter, prosody-driven utterance segmentation and also include punctuation and capitalization\u2014elements absent from the Gos 1 and Gos VideoLectures datasets. With the exception of casing, which was resolved automatically by removing the casing information from the beginnings of utterances in Artur datasets, we opted not to resolve segmentation and punctuation-related differences in this initial release to allow for user-driven suggestions on the optimal transcription representations.\\n\\nFinally, the encoding of the three datasets had to be unified, as the Gos 1 and Gos VideoLectures followed older versions of the TEI XML schema. The unification included the already mentioned typology but also e.g. harmonization of text titles, their source and setting descriptions, coding of disfluencies, and different treatments of word capitalization.\\n\\n4. Data annotation\\n\\nGiven that different tools have been used for automatic linguistic annotation of Gos 1 and Gos VideoLectures corpora, and no annotations were featured in the Artur database, we decided to follow a complete reannotation of the new Gos 2 corpus using the CLASSLA-Stanza NLP tool (Ljube\u0161i\u0107 and Dobrovoljc, 2019; Ter\u010don and Ljube\u0161i\u0107, 2023) to annotate transcriptions with lemmas, part-of-speech tags and other morphosyntactic features according to the MULTEXT-East annotation scheme (Erjavec, 2010), commonly used in the reference corpora of Slovenian.\\n\\nHowever, rather than applying the default models trained on standard and non-standard written data, which have been shown to perform suboptimally when confronted with speech transcriptions (Dobrovoljc and Martinc, 2018), we developed speech-specific models based on a series of experiments combining the available manually annotated datasets for Slovenian, i.e. the ssj500k training corpus of standard written Slovenian (Krek et al., 2021), the JANES-tag corpus of non-standard written Slovenian (Erjavec et al., 2019), and the SST treebank of spoken Slovenian, a manually annotated sample of the original Gos 1 corpus (Dobrovoljc and Nivre, 2016).\\n\\nAs shown in Table 1, which gives the performance of the different CLASSLA-Stanza v1.2 models when evaluated on the SST test set, the tool performs better if SST spoken data is featured in the training procedure. Specifically, best performance for the morphosyntactic tagging was achieved using the combination of all three datasets (F1 94.02), while the best lemmatization performance was achieved by a model trained on a combination of spoken and standard written data alone (F1 98.33). Therefore, these two CLASSLA-Stanza models have been used in the final annotation of Gos 2 corpus.\\n\\nTable 3: CLASSLA-Stanza performance (micro F1) on the spoken SST test set using different training scenarios for lemmatization and PoS tagging.\\n\\n| Training Data          | Lemma F1 | Tag F1 |\\n|------------------------|----------|--------|\\n| classla_standard (ssj500k) | 97.24    | 82.02  |\\n| classla_non-standard (JANES) | 93.68    | 84.21  |\\n| SST                    | 97.87    | 91.74  |\\n| SST+ssj500k            | 98.33    | 93.85  |\\n| SST+JANES              | 98.22    | 92.63  |\\n| SST+ssj500+JANES       | 98.27    | 94.02  |\\n\\nTable 5: Speech-to-text alignment\\n\\nGos 2 transcriptions are aligned with the speech recordings on the level of utterances and words. While utterance-level alignment was already performed manually as part of the compilation of the original Gos 1, as was the case with Gos VideoLectures and Artur corpora, there was no word-level alignment available.\\n\\nTo increase the usefulness of the Gos corpus for word-level research, we have performed word alignment of the transcripts with the speech recordings by following the Kaldi (Povey et al., 2011) recipe for forced alignment via an acoustic model based on parliamentary speech and transcript data. We have encoded the word alignment information in form of time offsets of the beginning of each word only if the alignment procedure offered an alignment for every word in a segment. With this procedure, 79% of segments received alignment information. The reason for a rather low percentage of successful alignments is primarily to be followed to varying quality of the recordings inside the Gos 1 section of the Gos 2 corpus. While 98% of the segments in the Artur section of the Gos 2 corpus were successfully aligned, the number plummets to around 20% for Gos 1 and around 40% for Gos VideoLectures.\\n\\nThe alignment of the speech signal was very successful in the Artur section of the Gos 2 corpus due to the high quality of recordings, as well as low percentage of overlapping speech. Given that the word alignment of the Gos Videolectures and the Gos 1 sections of the Gos 2 corpus, the usefulness of the only partial word alignment information is questionable and requires for stronger word alignment techniques to be applied in the future.\\n\\n5. Data release\\n\\nGos 2 is encoded in XML following the TEI Guidelines using the TEI parameterization as recommended by the CLARIN.SI research infrastructure. The corpus is encoded as one XML file.\"}"}

The interface, illustrated in Figure 1, follows the design and the functionalities of the concordancer of the Gigafida reference corpus of written Slovenian (Krek et al., 2020; Arhar Holdt et al., 2019), and extends it with several new speech-specific features.\\n\\nSpecifically, users can browse the corpus by typing in a word or a phrase based on either standardized or pronunciation-based spelling (simple search) or by specifying its grammatical and contextual features (advanced search) to obtain a list of concordances and associated utterance recordings (Figure 1) with frequencies across different metadata categories, which can also be used for further filtering of the results by event type, speaker demographics and other relevant criteria. Clicking on a specific concordance displays the preceding and the following utterance, more information on the event and the speaker, as well as information on grammatical features of the tokens in the utterance under investigations.\\n\\nIn addition to the 'List' function that produces a frequency list of the word forms matching the input criteria (e.g. a list of all pronunciation variations of a given standardized form), users can also benefit from a function that triggers identical queries in online interfaces of other reference language resources for Slovenian, such as the Gigafida written corpus, the Sloleks morphological dictionary, the Dictionary of Collocations and the Thesaurus.\\n\\nThe source code of the new concordancer is freely available on the CLARIN.SI GitHub repository and consists of two main parts: the web application (.ASP.NET Core 6) and the console application (.NET 6).\\n\\n**Conclusion**\\n\\nWe have presented Gos 2, a new version of the Gos reference corpus of spoken Slovenian, which has recently been extended to more than double the original size and improved with respect to linguistic annotation, speech-to-text alignment, data formatting and online accessibility.\\n\\nAlthough this work represents an important and much anticipated addition to the Slovenian language resource landscape, especially in the realm of corpus linguistic research, it is merely the initial stride in the\"}"}
