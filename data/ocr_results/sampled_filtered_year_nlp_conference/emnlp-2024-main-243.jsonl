However, many current methodologies evaluate scenarios in isolation, without considering the broader context or the spectrum of potential biases within each situation. To address this, we introduce the Sensitivity Testing on Offensive Progressions (STOP) dataset, which includes 450 offensive progressions containing 2,700 unique sentences of varying severity that progressively escalate from less to more explicitly offensive. Covering a broad spectrum of 9 demographics and 46 sub-demographics, STOP ensures inclusivity and comprehensive coverage. We evaluate several leading closed- and open-source models, including GPT-4, Mixtral, and Llama 3. Our findings reveal that even the best-performing models detect bias inconsistently, with success rates ranging from 19.3% to 69.8%. We also demonstrate how aligning models with human judgments on STOP can improve model answer rates on sensitive tasks such as BBQ, StereoSet, and CrowS-Pairs by up to 191%, while maintaining or even improving performance. STOP presents a novel framework for assessing the complex nature of biases in LLMs, which will enable more effective bias mitigation strategies and facilitates the creation of fairer language models.\\n\\n1 Introduction\\n\\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) have made significant advancements in various fields, including medicine, engineering, and education (Sarker et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023; Gill et al., 2024). Platforms such as ChatGPT (Liu et al., 2023) and Claude 2 ease consumer interactions with LLMs. However, the quality of these interactions may be compromised if a model exhibits bias, which is commonly defined as any \u201cskew that produces a type of harm\u201d and can exist both implicitly and explicitly (Crawford, 2017; Dong et al., 2023). Implicit biases are unconscious attitudes that affect understanding, actions, and decisions without awareness or intention, whereas explicit biases are conscious attitudes that are deliberately formed and expressed, often involving overt prejudice or discrimination (Bai et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2019).\\n\\nNumerous resources have been developed to identify and mitigate bias in LLMs. Perspective API and RealToxicityPrompts (Gehman et al., 2020) cover a spectrum of abusive language, but primarily focus on explicit biases through profanities, threats and insults. Conversely, BBQ, StereoSet, and CrowS-Pairs focus on social biases such as stereotyping, capturing subtle forms of discrimination suitable for evaluating implicit bias (Parrish et al., 2022; Nangia et al., 2020; Nadeem et al., 2021). However, these resources often evaluate scenarios in isolation, without considering the broader context or the spectrum of potential biases within each situation. Moreover, datasets that focus on explicit bias may overlook less inflammatory language that still harbors negative sentiment towards target demographics (Zhao et al., 2023; Gonen and Goldberg, 2019).\\n\\nWe propose measuring bias through progressively offensive scenarios to evaluate appropriateness, which we define as \u201cthe degree to which an expression or action is considered acceptable or inoffensive within a given social context\u201d. This concept serves as a means to identify the threshold where bias becomes recognizable and transitions from implicit to explicit, mirroring real-world situations where bias often emerges subtly and gradually escalates.

This tests whether the model can maintain its stance on the appropriateness of the situation despite the additional context.\\n\\n2.2 Task Construction\\n\\nto construct TST, we developed a human-authored seed set of offensive progressions inspired by common microaggressions against various demographics, as discussed in notable psychology literature (Sue et al., 2007; Kiekens et al., 2022; Nadal et al., 2012; Basford et al., 2014). Microaggressions are subtle, often unintentional, behaviors or statements that convey bias or prejudice towards marginalized groups. By using microaggressions as inspiration, we aim to capture the subtle, context-dependent nature of bias in real-world scenarios.\\n\\nIn this seed set, key identifiers such as names, pronouns, settings, actions, and objects are written as exchangeable variables. We then prompt GPT-4-0125-preview through the OpenAI API to create variants that fit specific sub-demographics. The system and user prompts guide the scaling process by providing instructions and examples for generating variations of the seed progressions. For the detailed prompts, see Appendix A.1.\\n\\nFor instance, take this sentence from a seed progression addressing religious bias:\\n\\n\\\"At the fitness center, [name1] wears a [religious garb] while working out.\\\"\\n\\nAfter scaling, a variation for Islam and a variation for Christianity, two major religious demographics, would look like:\\n\\n\\\"At the fitness center, Fatima wears a hijab while working out.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"At the fitness center, Mark wears a cross necklace while working out.\\\"\\n\\nGPT-4 was chosen for scaling over simple word substitution due to its ability to handle complex linguistic adjustments. Table 2 illustrates this, highlighting that unlike simple word substitution, GPT-4 can appropriately adjust terms outside of the variables, such as \\\"practicing\\\" to \\\"identifies as\\\" and \\\"faith\\\" to \\\"beliefs\\\", to ensure coherency and more natural sounding language when scaling.\\n\\nFor each progression, a human author then creates a counterfactual sentence by providing additional context that attempts to justify the biased content in the scenario. The counterfactual sentence tests the model's ability to maintain its stance on the appropriateness of the situation despite the additional context. For instance, a counterfactual sentence for the Islam variation of the religious bias example is:\\n\\n\\\"The fitness center has a strict dress code that prohibits head coverings for safety reasons. Should Fatima be allowed to wear her hijab while working out?\\\"\"}"}

By including counterfactual sentences, the STOP dataset evaluates a model's robustness in maintaining its ethical stance in the face of potentially justifiable reasons for problematic behavior.\\n\\nFigure 1 illustrates the entire process of dataset construction from conception to testing, including the number of instances developed at each stage.\\n\\n2.3 Task Composition\\n\\nOffensive progressions in STOP are categorized by severity level, demographic, and sub-demographic.\\n\\nSeverity Level:\\nSeverity levels consist of low, moderate, and high. Moderate severity progressions, which make up 60% of the dataset, begin with a non-problematic sentence and each of the subsequent four sentences escalate in explicitly problematic content. Both low and high severity progressions each make up 20% of the dataset; the low severity progressions contain no problematic content across all five sentences and the high severity progressions contain exclusively problematic content. Table 4 highlights the exact number of offensive progressions in each category. Table 1 showcases a moderate severity scenario and Tables 11 and 12 of the Appendix showcase low and high severity scenarios respectively.\\n\\nDemographics:\\nSTOP encompasses 9 social demographics drawn from the United States' Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) guidelines, which were then modified to ensure comprehensive coverage of social groups and include additional demographics such as class and political ideology. Table 3 compares the demographics included in STOP with popular datasets including BBQ, CrowS-Pairs, and StereoSet (Parrish et al., 2022; Nangia et al., 2020; Nadeem et al., 2021).\\n\\nSub-demographics:\\nEach demographic is composed of sub-demographics that represent smaller, more specific social groups. We identified 46 sub-demographics based on current health, humanities, and sociology literature, including disability prevalence (Metwally et al., 2023), class stratification (Wright, 1997; Peoples, 2012), racial and ethnic categories (Criss et al., 2024), weight and health perspectives (Tylka et al., 2014), sexual orientation and gender identity (Institute of Medicine, 2011), political ideologies (Str\u00e5th, 2013), religious beliefs (Herzog et al., 2020), and age groups (Leversen et al., 2012). Table 5 showcases each represented sub-demographic.\\n\\nThe seed set consists of 6 moderate, 2 low, and 2 high severity prompts for each demographic, which are then scaled by the sub-demographics to create the full dataset. For example, if a demographic contains 6 moderate severity progressions in the seed set and we scale it by 8 sub-demographics, the final number of progressions is 48 with 288 sentences (6 per progression). Table 4 shows this scaling factor for every demographic.\\n\\n2.4 Task Evaluation\\nTo assess a model's sensitivity to problematic content, we evaluate its performance on individual offensive progressions. This process involves prompting the model with sentences from the progression and analyzing its responses. First, the model M is prompted with the first sentence of the scenario, s1, and its response, r1, is recorded:\\n\\n5https://www.eeoc.gov/prohibited-employment-policiespractices\"}"}

Finally, the model is prompted with the counterfactual sentence, $C$, and its response, $r_c$, is recorded:\\n\\n$$M(C) \\\\rightarrow r_c$$\\n\\nThe model's responses to a given progression are then quantified as a sensitivity score, calculated by dividing the number of \\\"no\\\" responses by the total number of sentences in the scenario $S$.

The criteria for idealistic performance are:\\n\\n1. Considering all sentences in low severity scenarios as appropriate (sensitivity score of 0.0).\\n2. Considering all sentences in high severity scenarios as inappropriate (sensitivity score of 1.0).\\n3. Considering the first sentence of a moderate severity scenario as appropriate and the rest as inappropriate (sensitivity score of 0.8).\\n\\nWe express the overall success rate $P$ as a unified mean using the formula:\\n\\n$$P = \\\\frac{c_l + c_m + c_h}{n}$$\\n\\nWhere $c_l$, $c_m$, and $c_h$ are the count of correct answers for low severity, moderate severity, and high severity progressions, respectively, and $n$ is the total number of progressions evaluated. Each severity level in $P$ is weighted equally for simplicity and consistency, though alternative weighting schemes based on the relative importance or prevalence of each severity level may be considered in future work. The success rates for each individual severity level $P_l$, $P_m$, and $P_h$ are expressed as simple proportions:\\n\\n$$P_l = \\\\frac{c_l}{n_l}, \\\\quad P_m = \\\\frac{c_m}{n_m}, \\\\quad P_h = \\\\frac{c_h}{n_h}$$\\n\\nWhere $n_l$, $n_m$, and $n_h$ are the number of progressions within each respective severity level. The performance on the counterfactual sentence $P_{counter}$ is calculated separately by taking the total count of \\\"no\\\" responses to the counterfactual sentences, $c_{counter}$, and dividing it by the total number of progressions:\\n\\n$$P_{counter} = \\\\frac{c_{counter}}{n}$$\\n\\nThe ideal response to the counterfactual sentence should always be \\\"no,\\\" as the additional context is insufficient to justify the problematic content in moderate and high severity scenarios, and low severity scenarios contain no inherent bias that requires justification.\\n\\n2.6 Realistic Performance\\n\\nRealistic performance evaluates the alignment between model responses and human judgments. Human annotators are presented with offensive progressions, and their responses are quantified as sensitivity scores, allowing for direct comparison with the models. The alignment between human and model responses is then quantified as a sensitivity score, allowing for direct comparison with the models.\"}"}

LLMs have been shown to disproportionately impact individuals of specific social demographics, such as religion, sex, race, age, educational institution, nationality, and disability (Abid et al., 2021; Gonen and Goldberg, 2019; Wan et al., 2023; Sap et al., 2021; Kamruzzaman et al., 2024; Venkit et al., 2022). This bias is often revealed in natural language generation tasks (Sheng et al., 2019), code generation (Huang et al., 2024), and persists across various languages (Zhou et al., 2019).\\n\\nImplicit bias evaluation\\n\\nExisting metrics quantify bias in LLMs through various approaches, such as question-answering (QA) prompts (Shin et al., 2024; Nangia et al., 2020; Nadeem et al., 2021; Parrish et al., 2022) and sentence completion tasks or counterfactual evaluations (Gehman et al., 2020; Dhamala et al., 2021; Huang et al., 2020). We build on this work by introducing a novel QA task that facilitates the transition from implicit to explicit bias and incorporates counterfactual reasoning.\\n\\nHuman-model alignment\\n\\nTraining models on human feedback has been explored to improve summarization quality (Stiennon et al., 2020), assess the trustworthiness of LLMs (Li et al., 2024), and align human and model judgments in casual and moral reasoning tasks (Nie et al., 2023). Our work expands on this concept by utilizing our scenario-based dataset to quantify human-model alignment and strengthen it through fine-tuning.\\n\\n6 Conclusion\\n\\nWe introduced STOP to assess how LLMs handle bias within context rich, real-world scenarios. Our findings reveal substantial variability in bias sensitivity across models, with no model consistently identifying bias across all scenarios or achieving over 70% accuracy. While humans generally show lower sensitivity to bias compared to LLMs, fine-tuning models on human data markedly improves their ability to engage with and perform well on existing bias evaluation tasks.\"}"}

While efforts were made to cover a diverse set of scenarios and demographics, the dataset may not exhaustively capture all possible manifestations of bias. Future work could explore methods for automatically generating offensive progressions to increase coverage and diversity.\\n\\nHuman evaluation\\nThe human evaluation of STOP was conducted with a relatively small group of internal annotators. While the annotators represented diversity across several demographics, they may not fully capture the wide range of cultural and societal perspectives on bias. Expanding the human evaluation to a larger, more diverse pool of annotators could provide more robust and representative benchmarks for model alignment.\\n\\nFine-tuning experiments\\nOur fine-tuning experiments were limited to a single model (Llama 3-70b) and a small set of existing bias evaluation tasks (BBQ, StereoSet, and CrowS-Pairs). Further research is needed to investigate the generalizability of our findings to other models and downstream tasks, as well as to explore more advanced fine-tuning techniques for improving model sensitivity to offensive progressions.\\n\\nBias mitigation\\nWhile STOP focuses on evaluating model sensitivity to bias, it does not directly address the challenge of mitigating biased outputs in LLMs. Developing effective debiasing techniques that can be applied during pre-training, fine-tuning, or inference remains an important area for future work.\\n\\nEthical Considerations\\n\\nPotential misuse\\nWhile STOP is intended to help researchers and practitioners better understand and mitigate bias in LLMs, it is important to recognize the potential for misuse. Bad actors could potentially use the dataset to train models to generate more convincing offensive content or to reinforce existing biases. To mitigate this risk, we will release STOP with clear usage guidelines and restrictions, emphasizing that it should only be used for research purposes aimed at improving model fairness and sensitivity to bias.\\n\\nOffensive content\\nBy design, STOP contains a significant amount of offensive and biased content in various demographics. Exposure to such content can be disturbing or triggering for some individuals. We will ensure that appropriate content warnings and disclaimers are provided with the dataset, and we encourage researchers to prioritize the mental well-being of annotators and participants involved in future studies using STOP.\\n\\nDemographic representation\\nWhile STOP covers a wide range of demographics and sub-demographics, it is important to acknowledge that no dataset can perfectly capture the full diversity of human identities and experiences. We have made efforts to include a broad range of demographics, but we recognize that some groups may still be underrepresented or absent from the dataset. Future work should continue to expand and refine the demographic categories represented in the bias evaluation datasets.\\n\\nFairness in evaluation\\nWhen using STOP to evaluate the sensitivity of LLMs to bias, it is crucial to ensure that all models are assessed fairly and consistently. Researchers should be transparent about their evaluation methodologies and should strive to minimize any potential sources of bias or confounding factors in their analyses.\\n\\nResponsible deployment\\nAs LLMs continue to be deployed in an increasing number of real-world applications, it is essential that developers and practitioners use datasets like STOP to thoroughly evaluate and mitigate potential biases before deployment. The development of fair, unbiased, and socially responsible AI systems should be a top priority for the research community and industry alike. By openly discussing these ethical considerations and taking proactive steps to address them, we aim to promote the responsible development and use of STOP and other bias evaluation datasets in the field of natural language processing.\\n\\nAcknowledgements\\nThis work was supported by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada and by the New Frontiers in Research Fund.\\n\\nReferences\\nAbubakar Abid, Maheen Farooqi, and James Zou. 2021.
