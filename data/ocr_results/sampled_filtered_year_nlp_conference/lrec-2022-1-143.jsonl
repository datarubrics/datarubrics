The lexicon is created in the theoretical framework of the Functional Generative Description and based on corpus data. In total, NomVallex 2.0 comprises of 1027 lexical units contained in 570 lexemes, covering the following part-of-speech and derivational categories: deverbal and deadjectival nouns, and deverbal, denominal, deadjectival and primary adjectives. Valency properties of a lexical unit are captured in a valency frame which is modeled as a sequence of valency slots, supplemented with a list of morphemic forms. In order to make it possible to study the relationship between valency behavior of base words and their derivatives, lexical units of nouns and adjectives in NomVallex are linked to their respective base words, contained either in NomVallex itself or, in case of verbs, in a valency lexicon of Czech verbs called VALLEX. NomVallex enables a comparison of valency properties of a significant number of Czech nominals with their base words, both manually and in an automatic way; as such, we can address the theoretical question of argument inheritance, concentrating on systemic and non-systemic valency behavior.\\n\\nKeywords: valency, lexicon, nouns, adjectives, derivational relation\\n\\n1. Introduction\\nValency is the \\\"capacity a verb (or noun, etc.) has for combining with particular patterns of other sentence constituents\\\" (Allerton, 2006: 301). Exhibited not only by verbs, but also by some nouns, adjectives or adverbs, valency thus forms the syntactic core of the sentence. While valency of verbs has enjoyed long-standing interest from linguists, the description of valency of nouns (Grimshaw, 1990; Spevak, 2014; Krasikova et al., 2019) or adjectives (Haugen, 2013) has long remained out of their spotlight. Concerning deverbal and deadjectival nouns, legitimacy of inferring their valency properties from their base words is addressed, see the so-called argument inheritance proposed by Booij (2007) and discussed by Allerton (2006), Goldberg (2006), Herbst (1988) or Moravcsik (2009). Being the subject of both theoretical and lexicographic studies, valency of nouns and adjectives is captured in some English valency lexicons (Herbst et al., 2004) and lexical databases created for NLP applications such as FrameNet (Ruppenhofer et al., 2010) and NomBank (Meyers et al., 2008). In lexicons of Slavic languages, valency of nouns or adjectives is only rarely covered, be it valency lexicons (Mel'\u010duk and Zholkovsky, 1984; Alberski et al., 2018) or general language dictionaries (Ivanov\u00e1, 2020). Valency of Czech nouns and adjectives has been studied within various theoretical frameworks, e.g., the modified valency theory (Karl\u00edk, 2000), transformational generative grammar (Veselovsk\u00e1, 2001; Dvo\u0159\u00e1k, 2016a,b), and the lexicological and \\\"corpus-driven\\\" approach (\u010cerm\u00e1k, 1991; Kop\u0159ivov\u00e1, 2006; \u010cerm\u00e1kov\u00e1, 2009). It is also covered by a printed valency lexicon Slovn\u00edk slovesn\u00fdch, substantivn\u00edch a adjektivn\u00edch vazeb a spojen\u00ed (Svozilov\u00e1, Prouzov\u00e1 and Jirsov\u00e1, 2005).\\n\\n2. Valency of Czech Nouns and Adjectives in the Functional Generative Description\\nOur approach to valency of nouns and adjectives is based on the valency theory developed in the Functional Generative Description (FGD), primarily designed for verbs (Panevov\u00e1, 1974\u201375) and then adopted for deverbal nouns (Panevov\u00e1, 2000; Kol\u00e1\u0159ov\u00e1, 2010) and adjectives (Panevov\u00e1, 1998). We find this theory useful for describing various language phenomena related to valency as it differentiates between two syntactic layers: the so-called tectogrammatical layer, roughly corresponding to the deep syntactic layer, and the layer of surface syntax. In FGD, valency represents a core component of the tectogrammatical layer (Sgall, Haji\u010dov\u00e1 and Panevov\u00e1, 1986). It is captured by valency frames consisting of a set of slots, each standing for one valency complementation. Each valency complementation is assigned a functor (a label marking the relation of the valency complementation to its governing word), a set of morphemic forms determining the surface realization of the complementation, and information on its obligatoriness. Valency complementations are distinguished into actants and free modifications. Five actants which combine with verbs, adjectives and nouns are determined based on mostly syntactic criteria: ACTor, PATient, ADDRessee, EFFect, ORIGin (e.g., balen\u00ed d\u00e1rk\u016f PAT rodi\u010di ACT 'wrapping of the presents PAT by parents ACT'), while MATerial is a specific actant occurring with nouns only (e.g., jedno balen\u00ed l\u00e9k\u016f MAT 'one package of medicine MAT'). Free modifications are semantically distinctive (e.g., DIR3, a free modification of direction 'where to?' in chlapc\u016fv ACT pozdn\u00ed p\u0159\u00edchod do \u0161koly DIR3 'boy's ACT late arrival to the school DIR3').\\n\\nWith deverbal adjectives as well as with deverbal and deadjectival nouns, systemic (regular) and non-systemic (irregular) valency behavior is distinguished (Kol\u00e1\u0159ov\u00e1, Vernerov\u00e1 and Verner, 2019; Kol\u00e1\u0159ov\u00e1, Vernerov\u00e1 and Kl\u00edmov\u00e1, 2020a; Kol\u00e1\u0159ov\u00e1, Vernerov\u00e1 and Kl\u00edmov\u00e1, 2021; Section 4). Extensive research into valency within FGD resulted in the creation of several valency lexicons: PDT-Vallex, a valency lexicon of verbs, nouns, adjectives and adverbs contained in the Prague Dependency Treebank\u2013Consolidated (PDT-C; Haji\u010d et al., 2020; Ure\u0161ov\u00e1 et al., 2021), VALLEX, a valency lexicon of Czech verbs, describing their uses in both active and passive, reciprocal...\"}"}

In order to do that, VALLEX and NomVallex are based on larger corpus data (especially on the SYN series of corpora from the Czech National Corpus; K\u0159en et al., 2019), treat all senses of the words included, annotate the formation of multiple syntactic phenomena, and employ facilities enabling not only to annotate the particular verbal and nominal constructions but also to perform complex searches and comparisons.\\n\\n3. The NomVallex Lexicon NomVallex is a valency lexicon of Czech nominals, covering several derivational types of nouns and adjectives (for its newest version, NomVallex 2.0, see Kol\u00e1\u0159ov\u00e1, Vernerov\u00e1, and Kl\u00edmov\u00e1, 2022). It was manually annotated, applying the main principles and annotation guidelines specified in Sections 3.1\u20133.4. The original data set was created in a simple text format but is publicly available in several standardized form (Section 3.5).\\n\\n3.1 Organization of the Lexicon NomVallex follows in the footsteps of the VALLEX lexicon, adopting its annotation scheme. The lexicon entry in both lexicons is called a lexeme; it is an abstract unit associating lexical forms with their lexical units (LUs; Cruse, 1986), i.e., word senses. The particular lexical meanings are described by synonyms or just roughly paraphrased in a gloss (the synon attribute). Aspectual counterparts formed by affixation, such as vyz\u00fdv\u00e1n\u00ed impf\u2013vyzv\u00e1n\u00ed pf 'appealing' or ohro\u017eovan\u00fd impf\u2013ohro\u017een\u00fd pf 'threatened', are treated within a single lexeme, though some of the lexical units of the lexemes may only be relevant for one of them, usually for the perfective form (e.g., vyzv\u00e1n\u00ed pf 'appeal', Figure 1). Nouns or adjectives that do not express aspect are assigned the flag no-aspect, e.g., v\u00fdzva no-aspect 'appeal'. If relevant, the short form of adjectives is also listed (e.g., ochoten 'willing' is the shortened version of the adjective ochotn\u00fd 'willing'; the shortform attribute).\\n\\nValency properties are captured in a valency frame (modeled as a sequence of valency slots, each characterized by a functor and supplemented with a list of morphemic forms; Section 2), and documented by examples. Other attributes are optionally specified, e.g.,\\n\\n| Valency properties | Example |\\n|--------------------|---------|\\n| Aspectual counterparts | vyz\u00fdv\u00e1n\u00ed impf\u2013vyzv\u00e1n\u00ed pf |\\n| Nouns or adjectives with aspect | v\u00fdzva no-aspect |\\n| Short form of adjectives | ochoten 'willing' |\\n\\nIn extension of the basic VALLEX annotation scheme, NomVallex employs some new attributes and facilities in order to enable research into phenomena related to part-of-speech specificity of the covered nominals (nouns and adjectives). First, it tries to tackle the fact that various lexical meanings of the nominals may refer to different basic semantic categories, i.e., may denote for example an abstract result of an action in one of their meanings, e.g., pohled 'view', but a material object in another one, e.g., pohled 'postcard' (Section 3.2). Second, it aims to document the richness and variability of nominal valency structures in common use, extensively quoting corpus evidence supporting the valency properties described in the valency frames (Section 3.3). Third, so-called non-canonical realization of adjectival valency is also treated (Section 4.1). Finally, its main ambition is to enable an examination of the extent to which nouns and adjectives share valency properties with their base words and thus to verify the valency inheritance hypothesis (Sections 3.2 and 4).\\n\\nIn total, NomVallex 2.0 is comprised of 1027 lexical units contained in 570 lexemes (when considering aspectual counterparts, such as nam\u00edt\u00e1n\u00ed impf\u2013nam\u00edtnut\u00ed pf 'expressing objections' or ohro\u017eovan\u00fd impf\u2013ohro\u017een\u00fd pf 'threatened', to be individual lexical units, the number rises to 1209 lexical units covering a total of 639 lemmas); the lexemes can be classified by part-of-speech and derivational categories as shown in Table 1.\\n\\n| Part-of-speech category | Derivational category | Lexical units | Lexemes |\\n|-------------------------|-----------------------|---------------|---------|\\n| Nouns                   | deverbal              | 505           | 248     |\\n|                         | deadjectival          | 247           | 158     |\\n| Adjectives              | deverbal              | 179           | 116     |\\n|                         | denominal             | 28            | 14      |\\n|                         | deadjectival          | 6             | 6       |\\n|                         | primary               | 62            | 28      |\\n| Total                   |                       | 1027          | 570     |\\n\\nTable 1: The structure of the NomVallex 2.0 lexicon\\n\\n3.2 Interlinked Lexicon Entries NomVallex captures all lexical meanings of the nouns and adjectives included in the lexicon. When delimiting lexical meanings of the nominals, we also take into account their basic \\\"categorial\\\" meanings, i.e., meanings corresponding to basic semantic categories such as action (e.g., \u017e\u00e1d\u00e1n\u00ed (si) 'asking', dovt\u00edpen\u00ed (se) 'inferring'), abstract result of an action (e.g., \u017e\u00e1dost 'request'), property/quality (e.g., zdvo\u0159ilost 'politeness', d\u016fvtip 'ingenuity'), material object (e.g., pohled 'postcard', usedlost 'homestead') and container/quantity (e.g., po\u010det 'number', bohatstv\u00ed 'large quantities'); the categorial meanings are specified in the semcategory attribute (Figure 1). Such approach helps us to describe general valency properties characteristic of nouns or adjectives referring to particular semantic categories and thus to reflect changes in valency associated with some specific shifts in meaning of a noun or an adjective (e.g., action > a material object, as in \u010dlov\u011bk p\u0159e\u017eiv\u0161\u00ed hav\u00e1rii Acc 'a man surviving the crash' > p\u0159e\u017eiv\u0161\u00ed hav\u00e1rie Gen 'survivor of the crash', see also Section 4.1).\"}"}

There are two links illustrated in the Figure, both of them within the NomVallex lexicon, namely the deadjectival noun \u017e\u00e1dostivost 'desirousness, greediness' > the denominal adjective \u017e\u00e1dostiv\u00fd 'desirous, greedy', and the adjective \u017e\u00e1dostiv\u00fd 'desirous, greedy' > the deverbal noun \u017e\u00e1dost-2 'desire'. Proportional representation of part-of-speech categories included in NomVallex is also captured in the Figure.\\n\\nWhen selecting individual nominals to be included in NomVallex, nouns and adjectives that in one of their lexical meanings refer to actions, abstract results of actions or quality are preferred as these nominals typically represent non-verbal predicates and thus are likely to be valent.\\n\\nIn relevant cases, deverbal nouns and deverbal adjectives captured in NomVallex mirror the division of lexemes into lexical units of the base verbs captured in the VALLEX lexicon.\\n\\nIn order to make it possible to study the relationship between valency behavior of base words and their derivatives, lexical units of nouns and adjectives are linked to their respective base words (in case of verbs to lexical units of verbs contained in VALLEX), linking up to three parts of speech (i.e., noun\u2013verb, adjective\u2013verb, noun\u2013adjective, and noun\u2013adjective\u2013verb, see Figure 2 and 3 for the links \u017e\u00e1dost-1 'request' > \u017e\u00e1dat-2 'to ask', \u017e\u00e1danost 'demand'> \u017e\u00e1dan\u00fd-3 'in demand'> \u017e\u00e1dat-1 'to demand', and \u017e\u00e1dostivost 'desirousness, greediness'> \u017e\u00e1dostiv\u00fd 'desirous, greedy'> \u017e\u00e1dost-2 'desire').\\n\\nThe base words are specified in the derivedFrom attribute; in case the base lexical unit is an item of the VALLEX or NomVallex lexicon, its id is given, e.g., the lexical unit of the noun vyzv\u00e1n\u00ed 'appeal' with id blu\u2013vyzv\u00e1n\u00ed\u2013vyzv\u00e1n\u00ed\u20132 has derivedFrom value blu\u2013v\u2013vyzvat\u2013vyz\u00fdvat\u20131 which links it to its base lexical unit of the verb vyzvat pf\u2013vyz\u00fdvat impf 'to appeal' (Figure 1; blu is short for basic lexical unit, letters v/n/a differentiate among verbs, nouns, and adjectives).\\n\\nInterlinking relevant lexical units is an important feature of the NomVallex lexicon as it enables us to compare valency properties of the derivationally related lexical units in an automatic way (results of the automatic comparison, describing the difference in valency, are specified in the valdiff attribute, Section 4.4, Figure 1).\\n\\nIn its electronic version, NomVallex also provides links to the valency lexicon PDT-Vallex (Ure\u0161ov\u00e1 et al., 2021).\\n\\n3.3 Nominal Valency Structure\\n\\nWhile the core valency properties of nouns and adjectives are captured in the form of a valency frame (Section 2), the particular valency structures are exemplified by sentences manually selected from Czech corpora, in particular the SYN series of corpora from the Czech National Corpus (K\u0159en et al., 2019) and the Araneum Bohemicum Maximum corpus (Benko, 2015). The lexicon aims to illustrate the full range of syntactic structures of noun and adjectival phrases, and thus the syntactic behavior of every lexical unit is exemplified with all combinations of its participants (in all forms specified in the valency frame) which were found in the corpus data.\\n\\nIn order to make the examples clearly arranged, they are subdivided into segments according to the given combination of valency slots, e.g., ADDR+PAT: vyzv\u00e1n\u00ed Rusku ADDR a N\u011bmecku ADDR, aby se pokusily PAT vy\u0159e\u0161it region\u00e1ln\u00ed probl\u00e9my 'an appeal to Russia ADDR and Germany ADDR to try PAT to solve regional problems', with the headword (vyzv\u00e1n\u00ed 'appeal') highlighted, see Figure 1.\\n\\nIf a lexical unit of a lexeme has no valency, for example when its categorial meaning is an object with no valency potential (as is the case of the noun usedlost 'homestead'), its valency frame is labeled as EMPTY and corpus examples are introduced by \\\"combination\\\" NONE or are supplemented with a free modification, for example APPurtenance, e.g., Cesta k jeho usedlosti pat\u0159\u00ed obci 'The road leading to his usedlost belongs to the village'.\\n\\n3.4 Part-of-speech and Derivational Categories in NomVallex\\n\\n3.4.1 Nouns\\n\\nSo far, NomVallex has concentrated on deverbal and deadjectival nouns, leaving valent primary nouns such as \u0161ance na p\u0159e\u017eit\u00ed 'a chance of survival' aside. Deverbal nouns were the only part-of-speech category captured in the NomVallex 1.0 version (Kol\u00e1\u0159ov\u00e1, Vernerov\u00e1, and Kl\u00edmov\u00e1, 2020a,b). The lexicon captures...\"}"}

They lose the canonical realization of adjectival valency structure when they are derived from the adjectival base and thus correspond to the valency of the base lexical unit because the valency slot of the base adjective is still present in the valency frame of the derived form. For example, \\\"petr podez\u00edration mu\u017e\\\" (\\\"Peter suspects the man\\\"). When determining the deep syntactic structure of the valency frames of the lexical units not denoting an object, cf. the respective modifications of their base words, e.g., \\\"hav\u00e1rii p\u0159e\u017eiv\u0161\u00ed \u010dlov\u011bk\\\" (\\\"survivor of the crash\\\"). When adjectives denote objects (e.g., stems vs. roots of nominals, particular meaning, semantic class, types of their valency properties of selected derivationally related adjectives), their distribution depends on the type of the noun and/or the type of the complementation itself, individually and/or in groups.\\n\\nComparing morphemic forms (i.e., the surface expression) with the valency frame of the verb they form a predicate with, e.g., \\\"podez\u00edrat politika\\\" (\\\"to suspect the politician\\\"), and with the subject of the copula, e.g., \\\"ochotn\u00fd pomoct sb\\\" (\\\"willing to help\\\"). According to Kl\u00edmov\u00e1, the canonical realization of adjectival valency implies that it cannot be expressed on the surface as in Boguslavsky (2003), both types are also \\\"called discontinuous fence\\\", or with the subject of the copula as a nominalization of expression of a valency phenomenon called \\\"disintegrated fence\\\"). Thus, these adjectives lose some information encoded in the base lexical unit, e.g., \\\"plot je rozpadl\u00fd\\\" (\\\"the fence is disintegrated\\\"); see (1) and (2).\\n\\nThough nouns or adjectives also have one valency slot which is filled with the noun they modify (so \\\"podoz\u00edrat politika\\\"), they correspond to a subject (usually an ACT) of the copula, e.g., \\\"ochotn\u00fd pomoct sb\\\". This subject normally is encoded as a nominalization of the base lexical unit, e.g., \\\"ochotn\u00fd\\\" (\\\"willing\\\").\\n\\nAtoms correspond to the valency of nouns and differ from those of adjectives, e.g., \\\"ochotn\u00fd pomoct sb\\\". As a result, these adjectives lose their adnominal modification, e.g., \\\"ochotn\u00fd pomoct sb\\\" (\\\"willing to help\\\"). In valency frames of types (i) and (ii), both deep and surface realization of adjectival valency are expected to inherit all information encoded in the base lexical unit, e.g., \\\"ochotn\u00fd pomoct sb\\\". Comparing morphemic forms which do not change, i.e., especially members of their respective modifications of their base words, e.g., \\\"\u010dlov\u011bk p\u0159e\u017eiv\u0161\u00ed hav\u00e1rii\\\" (\\\"survivor of the crash\\\"), it corresponds to a systemic valency behavior of the noun or adjective (e.g., stem vs. root nominals, particular meaning, semantic class, types of its valency structure).\\n\\nThe previous version NomVallex 1.0, is also available in book form; it contains lexicon entries of deverbal nouns and adjectives also. See (1) and (2) for the two frames to have one valency slot which is filled with the noun they modify (so \\\"podoz\u00edrat politika\\\"). The annotation of adjectives is referred to as systemic and non-systemic Realization of Adjectival valency framework because the valency complementations and mark it by an upward arrow, e.g., \\\"ochotn\u00fd pomoct sb\\\" (\\\"willing to help\\\").\\n\\nThough atoms or adjectives also have one valency slot which is filled with the noun they modify (so \\\"podoz\u00edrat politika\\\"). As a result, these adjectives lose their adnominal modification, e.g., \\\"ochotn\u00fd pomoct sb\\\".

{"id": "lrec-2022-1-143", "page_num": 8, "content": "{\"primary_language\":\"en\",\"is_rotation_valid\":true,\"rotation_correction\":0,\"is_table\":false,\"is_diagram\":false,\"natural_text\":\"of valency frames of adjectives and deadjectival nouns, planned to be done in the future.\\n\\nDifferentiating nine types of Czech deverbal adjectives, we have observed that while a difference in the number of actants may affect all types of deverbal adjectives, even those derived from present transgressives but not denoting an action (e.g., rozhoduj\u00edc\u00ed okam\u017eik \u2018decisive moment\u2019), non-systemic forms of actants are only characteristic of selected adjectival types, most significantly of adjectives derived from verbs not strictly regularly and denoting various properties (e.g., podez\u00edrav\u00fd \u2018suspectful\u2019).\\n\\nIn valency frames of deverbal nouns, the non-systemic forms considerably contribute to a general increase in the number of forms in valency frames of deverbal nouns compared to the number of forms in valency frames of their base verbs. In line with our expectations, the data shows that non-systemic forms are more frequent in valency frames of root deverbal nouns than in valency frames of stem deverbal ones.\\n\\n5. Conclusion\\n\\nWe have presented NomVallex, a manually annotated valency lexicon of Czech nouns and adjectives, which is created in the theoretical framework of the Functional Generative Description and follows in the footsteps of the VALLEX lexicon. NomVallex quotes rich corpus evidence supporting the valency characteristics described in the valency frames and documents the richness and variability of Czech nominal valency structures in common use. Aiming to be a lexical resource that enables a comparison of valency properties of derivationally related lexical units, partially in an automatic way, the lexicon employs some special attributes and facilities; in particular, it provides links from derived lexical units to their base lexical units and, using an automatic procedure, it specifies the difference in valency between the two lexical units in the valdiff attribute. A careful investigation of such a comparison based on the NomVallex data shows that non-systemic valency behavior of Czech deverbal adjectives and deverbal nouns is mostly manifested by either a difference in the number of actants or non-systemic forms of actants, out of which the non-systemic forms are more dominant (frequent), represented especially by a non-systemic prepositional group.\\n\\nWe intend to employ the same method in order to specify to what extent other types of nominals from NomVallex, such as deadjectival nouns, inherit valency properties from their base words. Moreover, the online version of the lexicon and an offline application allow for formulating specific and complex queries based on a wide range of criteria, by far not limited to valency phenomena related to part-of-speech specificity.\\n\\n6.
