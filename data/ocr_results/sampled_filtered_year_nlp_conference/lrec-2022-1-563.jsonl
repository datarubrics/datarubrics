We first present the protocol used and the data collected from a survey of 184 children in two age groups (6-7 and 9-11 years) in four schools in Brittany (France). A word-level lexical study shows that children's linguistic proficiency and lexical diversity increase with age, and we observe an interaction effect between gender and age on lexical diversity as measured with MLR (Measure of Lexical Richness). In contrast, none of the control variables affects lexical density. We also present the lemmas that schoolchildren most often associate with each concept. Generalized linear mixed-effects models reveal significant effects of age, gender, and home language on some concept-lemma associations and specific interactions between age and gender. Most of the identified effects are documented in the child development literature. To better understand the process of semantic construction in children, additional lexical analyses at the n-gram, chunk, and clause levels would be helpful. We briefly present ongoing and planned work in this direction. The COSMOS data will soon be made freely available to the scientific community.\\n\\nKeywords: children survey, conceptual representations, lexical richness, lexical diversity, mixed-effects models\\n\\n1. Introduction\\n\\nCOSMOS (\\\"Construction S\u00e9mantique du MOnde et St\u00e9r\u00e9otypes\\\" [Semantic Construction of the World and Stereotypes]) is a French research project bringing together linguists and data scientists to study conceptual representations in schoolchildren aged 6 to 11. The project is supported by the MSHB (Maison des Sciences de l'Homme en Bretagne), a research unit that promotes interdisciplinary collaborative research at the heart of human and social sciences.\\n\\nThe project consists of conducting surveys in which children put certain concepts into words and, through their verbalizations, study their conceptual representations at two points in their schooling while considering sociodemographic and cultural factors. Beyond the interest of this knowledge per se, the outcomes have a didactic aim: to understand and evaluate the process of acquiring a semantic competence that goes beyond the referential use of words and, in the long run, to provide tools that will help prevent caricatural or fallacious presuppositions.\\n\\nThere seem to be universal stages in children's cognitive development, although these are subject to debate. Concrete operational stage occurs between ages 7 and 11: children become less egocentric, can solve complex problems, and acquire classification skills (Babakr et al., 2015). For example, by age 6-7, children can coordinate multiple social categories. By 10-12 years, development involves generalizations about concrete objects and events and the ability to abstract or think hypothetically (Fisher and Bullock, 1984). We are specifically interested in comparing children's conceptualizations between the beginning and end of this stage. Operationally, the literature reports that surveys with children must be tailored to their cognitive and social maturity. They can be interviewed as young as 6 or 7 years old in qualitative studies, with extreme caution and using their own words. Questions and instructions should be simple, and the risk of suggestibility is high (Borgers et al., 2000; de Leeuw, 2011). Our data collection protocol was designed with these concerns in mind.\\n\\nIn section 2, we describe the protocol used during the surveys, and provide some statistical descriptives of the data collected. We also examine children's language proficiency through the length of their responses and the length of the words they used.\\n\\nWe present in section 3 a lexical analysis of the collected data at the word level. The first part (section 3.1) concerns the lexical richness of the children's verbalizations and its variability by age, gender, and home language. In the second part, we present, for each concept (section 3.2), its most associated lemmas and the effect of age, gender, and home language on the significant concept-lemma associations. We illustrate the results with quotes from children's responses and, where available, relate them to the child development literature.\\n\\nIn the last section (section 4), we present our ongoing work at the word level and future work at other levels of segmentation of the collected texts.\"}"}

Data Collection\\n\\n2.1. Protocol\\n\\nWe collaborated with educators to adapt the SPA protocol (Galatanu, 2018) for children. We chose seven concepts for practical reasons (interviews duration, human resources available for the surveys) and relied on the literature on cognition and child development to select them. They cover different semantic fields related to the child's social life, namely (1) family: \u201cun p\u00e8re\u201d (a father), \u201cune m\u00e8re\u201d (a mother); (2) social interactions: \u201cun ami\u201d (a friend), \u201cun m\u00e9chant\u201d (a villain); (3) entertainment: \u201ct\u00e9l\u00e9vision\u201d (television); (4) values: \u201ctravail\u201d (work); (5) natural world: \u201cun chien\u201d (a dog).\\n\\nTwo age groups of children were investigated: 6-7-year-olds (first grade) and 9-11-year-olds (fourth and fifth grades). In order to compare the two populations, we chose a single protocol adapted to both age groups. Eight interviewers participated in the survey: 5 were part of the COSMOS research team, and 3 were adult volunteers from the education community. The interviewers participated in preliminary interviews to standardize their practices.\\n\\nHeadteachers provided written consent for their school\u2019s involvement and, for each participating class, an information sheet and consent form were sent home to all children. We had written parental consent for all participating children, and children provided oral assent before each session. Meetings were conducted in the schools (library, activities room or other spare room) during school time.\\n\\nEach child left the classroom for a face-to-face interview of ten to fifteen minutes with an interviewer, and a detailed transcript of the session was produced. The procedure was as follows: the interviewer explains the course of the session, clarifies that there are no right or wrong answers and that the children\u2019s responses will remain anonymous. The interviewer encourages the child to speak if needed, but is careful not to influence him/her. The interviewer writes down everything the child says, respecting the exact wording.\\n\\nThe children were asked two questions for each concept as illustrated below for the father concept:\\n\\n1. What words come to your mind if I say \u201ca father\u201d?\\n2. What do you think \u201ca father\u201d is?\\n\\nThe concepts were presented in the same random order for all children: friend, father, work, villain, television, mother, dog. The order of presentation could affect children\u2019s oral production, and, in this sense, the design was not balanced for order effects. However, this issue is not addressed here, not least because testing a given order/gender/age group interaction on all possible orders, even limiting to semantic field orders, leaves very few subjects, if any, per cell in each age group.\\n\\n2.2. Collected data\\n\\nThe surveys took place between March 2020 and March 2021 in 4 schools located in Brittany (France): school A in a peri-urban area, school D in a city-center area, and schools B and C in other urban areas. The socio-demographic information collected from the children was age, gender, grade, and the languages spoken at home. 184 children were interviewed, 126 in the 9-11 age group and 58 in the 6-7 age group. The distributions of children by school (A, B, C, D), gender (F, M) and age are given in Table 1. There are significantly more boys in school A and significantly more girls in school B ($\\\\chi^2(3) = 15.32, p < .001$, Cramer\u2019s $V = 0.29$), and we observe an over-representation of the 9-11-year olds in all schools because of the difference in the age ranges of the two groups.\\n\\n| School | 6-7 F | 6-7 M | 9-11 F | 9-11 M | Total |\\n|--------|-------|-------|--------|--------|-------|\\n| A      | 7     | 15    | 14     | 28     | 64    |\\n| B      | 12    | 3     | 15     | 7      | 37    |\\n| C      | 5     | 10    | 17     | 11     | 43    |\\n| D      | 4     | 2     | 16     | 18     | 40    |\\n| Total  | 28    | 30    | 62     | 64     | 184   |\\n\\nTable 1: Number of children by age, gender and school\\n\\nThe first language spoken at home is, in decreasing frequency: French, Arabic, Turkish, Maore, Lingala, Bambara, Armenian, Albanian and Russian. We divided the children into two groups according to their first home language: \u2018French\u2019 (F1) and \u2018Other\u2019 (E1). Table 2 gives the distribution of home language by age, gender and school. There is an under-representation of French as the first language in school A and its over-representation in school B ($\\\\chi^2(3) = 33.64, p < .001$, Cramer\u2019s $V = 0.43$).\\n\\n| Home language | French | Other |\\n|---------------|--------|-------|\\n| All           | 58.15  | 41.85 |\\n| Age group 6-7 | 62.1   | 37.9  |\\n| Age group 9-11| 56.4   | 43.6  |\\n| Gender F      | 55.3   | 44.7  |\\n| Gender M      | 61.1   | 38.9  |\\n| School A      | 29.7   | 70.3  |\\n| School B      | 78.4   | 21.6  |\\n| School C      | 74.4   | 25.6  |\\n| School D      | 67.5   | 32.5  |\\n\\nTable 2: Distribution (in %) of the first language by age, gender and school\\n\\nThe children tended to answer the first question with lists of words or nominal groups and the second question with clauses. Following the specifications laid down by (Berman and Slobin, 1994) for spoken language, we define a clause as a unified predicate describing a single situation (an activity, event, or state).\"}"}

Semicolons always indicate a transition to another clause, while commas are used to ease reading and allow for enumeration, especially in the first question. Dividing the text into clauses remains a challenging issue.\\n\\nDuring the interviews, many children did not distinguish between the two questions. We then chose to aggregate their responses to the two items; this produced 184 texts, one per child, and 46,600 words in total.\\n\\nWe first examined children's language proficiency through text and word length, which are known to be good indicators of this specific skill, particularly in lexical resources (Ruth and Bracha, 2010; Kang and Yan, 2018). We used two-way Anovas to investigate the effects of gender, age, and home language on children's language proficiency. We found out a significant main effect for age on both text length ($F(1, 176) = 17.1$, $p < .001$, $\\\\omega^2 = .08$) and word length ($F(1, 176) = 4.79$, $p = .03$, $\\\\omega^2 = .02$). Tukey's post hoc corrections showed that language proficiency is significantly higher in the 9-11 group than in the 6-7 group (text length: $t = 3.71$, $p < .001$, and word length: $t = 2.19$, $p = .03$). Statistical descriptives of the two indicators are given in tables 3 and 4 respectively, for all children and by age category.\\n\\n| Age group | mean std | min max | med |\\n|-----------|---------|--------|-----|\\n| all       | 253.2   | 148.3  | 18  | 989  | 231 |\\n| 6-7       | 193.9   | 108    | 18  | 435  | 186.5 |\\n| 9-11      | 280.5   | 156.5  | 65  | 989  | 251.5 |\\n\\nTable 3: Number of words per child.\\n\\n| Age group | mean std | min max | med |\\n|-----------|---------|--------|-----|\\n| all       | 4.16    | 0.32   | 3.51| 5.30 | 4.10 |\\n| 6-7       | 4.10    | 0.34   | 3.51| 5.24 | 4.06 |\\n| 9-11      | 4.18    | 0.30   | 3.61| 5.30 | 4.11 |\\n\\nTable 4: Length of words per child.\\n\\nThe following section focuses on the effects of gender, age, and home language on children's lexical richness in terms of lexical diversity and density and on the most common concept-lemma associations.\\n\\n3. Data analysis\\n\\nWe used various measures to assess the lexical richness of the corpus and constructed frequency distributions for the most significant \\\"concept-lemma\\\" pairs. We used these data as dependent variables in mixed-effects models (Baayen et al., 2008) with gender, age, and home language as predictors and school as a context variable whose effect was treated with random intercepts. Fixed and random effects were incrementally added to a minimal model, and we compared the models using the likelihood ratio test. We describe in the following the best-fitting model for each analysis. Visual inspection of the residual plots revealed no obvious deviations from homoscedasticity or normality in all presented cases. Computations were performed with the function $lmer$ from the package lme4 (Bates et al., 2012) in the statistical environment R (R Core Team, 2021).\\n\\nFor ease of reading, we refer to 6-7-year-olds as 6-7 and 9-11-year-olds as 9-11 in the following.\\n\\n3.1. Linguistic features\\n\\nLexical richness (LR) is a multidimensional feature of written and spoken language which refers to lexical sophistication and language proficiency. Many metrics have been proposed in the literature, the effectiveness of which is controversial (Van Hout and Vermeer, 2010; Zhang and Wu, 2021). Two characteristics are currently employed in writing and speaking to describe lexical development and language acquisition: lexical diversity and lexical density (Johansson, 2008).\\n\\nLexical density estimates linguistic complexity from the proportion of lexical words (i.e. nouns, verbs, adjectives and some adverbs) used. The most common measure of lexical density is the ratio of nouns, verbs, and adjectives (and often adverbs) to the total number of words. It is indicative of lexical density since content words contain more information than function words. Other options exist: noun ratio, ratio of lexical words to utterances, ratio of pronouns to words since pronouns refer to objects (Johansson, 2008), Etc.\\n\\nLexical diversity measures the number of different words used in a text: the more varied the vocabulary, the higher the lexical diversity. The traditional measure of lexical diversity is the TTR (Type-Token Ratio), the ratio of different words to the total number of words. The TTR is sensitive to the length of the text: the rate of different words increases less as the text gets longer due to lexical repetition. More sophisticated measures have been proposed to cope with this problem, as the index of Guiraud, VoCD, and MTLD (Measure of Textual Lexical Diversity). The index of Guiraud is the square root of TTR. VoCD (Malvern et al., 2004) is obtained from a series of random text samplings; it is suitable for texts of 50 words and more. MTLD is based on a moving window approach: it is the mean length of the sequential word strings in a text that maintains a given TTR value (default TTR=0.732).\"}"}
{"id": "lrec-2022-1-563", "page_num": 4, "content": "{\"primary_language\":\"en\",\"is_rotation_valid\":true,\"rotation_correction\":0,\"is_table\":false,\"is_diagram\":false,\"natural_text\":\"In MTLDbi, the MTLD calculation is performed twice: once in left-to-right text order and once in right-to-left text order. There is no agreement on the best measure of lexical diversity, but the Guiraud index, $V_{oCD}$, and MTLD are cited as the most reliable (Jarvis, 2013; McCarthy and Jarvis, 2010; Johansson, 2009). The MTLD measure is highly appropriate for short texts (Koizumi, 2012), which makes it relevant for our data. A. Vermeer (2004) argues that lexical density and diversity measures are not related to word difficulty. She proposes a measure of lexical richness based on classes of lemmas (voclists), according to their frequencies in a global corpus (Vermeer, 2004). Specifically, lemmas are divided into nine classes, and the relative coverage of the corpus by the classes is taken as the model. The MLR metric estimates a text's vocabulary size as a linear combination of parameters $q_i$, $i = 1 \\\\cdots 9$, where $q_i$ is the ratio between the text and the model coverage of class $i$. The minimum MLR value is 1 if all the words in the text belong to the first class of the thousand most frequent lemmas. A comparison between classical measures of lexical diversity showed that MLR succeeds in discriminating between two groups of students while measures such as TTR and $V_{oCD}$ fail to (Van Hout and Vermeer, 2010).\\n\\nWe built the global corpus used for MLR computation with Manulex, a French lexical resource related to schoolchildren (L\u00e9te et al., 2004). Manulex provides word occurrence frequencies in a corpus of 54 textbooks (1.9 million words). However, it does not provide the frequencies of grammatical words, so we have completed it with the frequencies of the 1500 most common words of the French language given by Eduscol, an official website of the French national education system.\\n\\nWe then divided the lemmas into 9 classes to construct a 'model' coverage, as in Vermeer (2004) and computed MLR scores as in Van Hout and Vermeer (2010). We excluded proper nouns from the calculation because most of them refer to names of friends mentioned by the children and are not relevant for our study.\\n\\nWe ran GLMMs with MTLD, MTLDbi, and MLR scores as dependent variables. The best-fitting models are presented in Table 5; they show a significant effect of age on lexical diversity, whatever the metric, and an interaction between age and gender on MLR scores. Specifically, Table 6 highlights that lexical diversity is significantly higher for older children, and when measured with the MLR metric, lexical diversity is significantly lower for non-French native boys compared to girls of the same background and French native boys.\\n\\nOn the other hand, age, gender, and home language have no significant effect on lexical density.\\n\\n### Table 5: Summary of Linear Mixed-Effects Models with MTLD, MTLDbi and MLR as outcome variables, with random intercepts for each school, and with age, gender and home language as predictors\\n\\n| Outcome Variable | Fixed effects | Random effect |\\n|------------------|---------------|---------------|\\n| MTLD             | Intercept: 35.77 (36.01 ***), Age: 3.31 (4.04 ***), Random effect: School intercept 1.24 (1.11) | |\\n| MTLDbi           | Intercept: 32.01 (31.27 ***), Age: 4.25 (5.71 ***), Random effect: School intercept 1.96 (1.40) | |\\n| MLR              | Intercept: 2.56 (26.45 ***), Age: 0.45 (<0.01), Gender: <0.01 <0.01 5.46 ns, Language (HL): <0.01 <0.01 -0.52 ns, Gender*HL: 0.26 <0.01 2.96 **, Random effect: School intercept <0.01 <0.01 1.07 <0.01 | |\\n\\nNote. SD = standard deviation; SE = standard error. Number of observations = 184. p-values: *** $p < 0.001$, ** $p < 0.01$, ns: not significant.\\n\\n#### 3.2. Concept-Lemma associations\\n\\nThis section focuses on the lemmas most often associated with the concepts under study and investigates whether sociocultural variables affect these associations. We sorted the lemmas by concept based on the number of children who used them at least once. We then used generalized binomial mixed-effects models to explore the effects of age, gender, and home language on selected concept-lemma associations. We considered age, gender, and home language as predictors, while school served as a contextual variable. Table 7 shows the results of the binomial GLMMs for the concept \\\"mother.\\\" Age affects significantly the \\\"mother-mom\\\" and \\\"mother-to help\\\" associations. Table 8 provides the list of concept-lemma associations for which significant effects of our predictors were found. These results are detailed, concept by concept, in the following.\\n\\n### 3.2.1. Friend ['ami']\\n\\nTable 9 gives the lemmas most associated with the concept friend and the number of children who mentioned them. Playing with peers is the primary context in which young children form friendships (Coelho et al., 2017) and indeed, we observe that \\\"jouer\\\" [to play] is the lexical word most associated with the concept friend. This association is more significant in 6-7-year-olds than in 9-11-year-olds (72.4% vs. 54%).\"}"}

Game is significantly more common among boys whose home language is French compared to girls in this category (21.2% of boys vs. 3.6% of girls).\\n\\nIn addition, many children reported enjoying television and spending time (19 children) or having fun (20 children) watching television alone or with family or friends.\\n\\nSome children expressed reservations: \\\"il ne faut regarder que parfois sinon on a les yeux qui font mal\\\" [you have to look only sometimes otherwise your eyes will hurt] (boy, 6 years old)\\n\\n\\\"pas tr\u00e8s bien mais franchement pour moi c'est un peu bien\\\" [not very good but honestly for me it's a bit good] (boy, 10 years old)\\n\\nHowever, no children referred to issues associated with excessive screen time, such as behavioral problems (less sleep, violent behavior, etc.) and health problems (obesity, low physical activity, etc.), which are well documented (Paulich et al., 2021; Atabey, 2017; Ejaz et al., 2020; Villani, 2001).\\n\\n3.2.6. Work\\n\\n\\\"travailler\\\" [to work] is by far the lemma most associated with the concept \\\"travail\\\" [work]. It is significantly more common among 6-7-year-olds (76% in 6-7 vs. 54% in 9-11), for whom travail [work] is primarily defined by travailler [to work].\\n\\n\\\"on est au bureau on travaille\\\" [we're in the office we work] (boy, 6 years old)\\n\\n\\\"bien \u00e9couter la ma\u00eetresse, bien travailler, bien lire et \u00e9crire\\\" [listen to the teacher, work well, read and write well] (boy, 6 years old)\\n\\n\\\"c'est l\u00e0 o\u00f9 on travaille dur\\\" [it's where we work hard] (girl, 6 years old)\\n\\nThree of the most common lemmas (learn, school, homework) refer directly to schoolwork: for most children, work refers to their own work. The association between work and school is significantly more important among 9-11-year-olds (34.9% in 9-11 vs. 10.3% in 6-7).\\n\\nThe lemma money is also significantly more used among 9-11-year-olds (34.1% in 9-11 vs. 10.3% in 6-7); it never refers to an allowance given by parents, but to the possibility of having a job to earn a living.\\n\\n\\\"pour gagner de l'argent ; pas non plus pour \u00eatre riche mais pour vivre bien\\\" [to earn money; not to be rich but to live well] (girl, 10 years old)\\n\\n\\\"c'est recevoir de l'argent\\\" [it's receiving money] (girl, 10 years old)\\n\\n\\\"les gens travaillent pour gagner de l'argent pour prendre soin de leurs familles\\\" [people work to earn money to take care of their families] (girl, 10 years old)\\n\\n\\\"tu travailles tu trouves des amis ; l'\u00e9cole c'est plus pour apprendre ; tu travailles pour gagner de l'argent ; \u00eatre heureux.\\\" [you work you find friends; school is more for learning; you work to earn money; be happy] (boy, 10 years old)\\n\\nIn a survey of 13- to 14-year-olds and their parents, Dixon et al. (2014) identify four categories related to beliefs about the goals of schooling: learning and gaining self-awareness; developing social and life skills; optimizing life chances and quality of life; and enabling future employment and economic well-being. The 9-11-year-old pupils in our survey generally express the same goals.\"}"}

Nevertheless, we observed that some 6-7-year-olds expressed fear of dogs:\\n\\n\\\"peut faire du mal\\\" (girl, 6 years old)\\n\\n\\\"mordre, m\u00e9chant\\\" (boy, 6 years old)\\n\\n\\\"un animal qui mord les gens\\\" (boy, 6 years old)\\n\\nThe lemma to like as an expression of affection to the dog is significantly more frequent in French native girls compared to non-French native girls (79.2% vs. 20.8%).\\n\\n4. Conclusion\\n\\nThe COSMOS data are transcripts of oral responses from 184 schoolchildren to open-ended questions about seven concepts: friend, father, mother, villain, work, television and dog. The collected data includes about 46 000 French words and will soon be freely available to the scientific community.\\n\\nWe presented the results of a word-level lexical study: assessing language proficiency and lexical richness in terms of lexical diversity and density and analyzing the most common associations between each concept and the collected lemmas. We used mixed-effects models to explore the effects of age, gender, and home language on lexical richness while considering variability across schools. We found that language proficiency and lexical diversity were significantly higher among older children. We also observed an interaction effect between home language and gender on lexical diversity as measured by MLR. The analysis of lemma-concept associations revealed a significant effect of age for all concepts except television, a gender effect on the concept friend (lemma buddy), a home language effect for the concept father (lemma to care), and a gender*language interaction for the concepts friend (lemma to trust), television (lemma to play), and dog (lemma to like). Many of the revealed effects are documented in the literature, with the exception of language and gender*language effects that may be related to the composition of the \\\"other\\\" home language group and deserve further study.\\n\\nResearch is currently in progress to determine children's representations of each concept by categorizing their associated lemmas: for example, the lemmas food, cooking, eating, nourishing associated with the concept mother could as well be grouped in the \\\"nourishing function\\\" category as in the \\\"food\\\" category.\\n\\nOther research directions include semantic analysis at chunk and clause levels (as defined in 2.2): taking into account multiword expressions (MWEs) (Baldwin and Kim, 2010; Laporte, 2018) such as \\\"faire tout pour quelqu'un\\\" [do everything for someone], \\\"passer du temps ensemble\\\" [spend time together], Etc.; disambiguation of certain words based on their context: for example, the meaning of \\\"aimer\\\" [to like, to love] used in \\\"mon papa c'est quelqu'un qui nous aime\\\" [my dad is someone who loves us] is not the same as in \\\"il aime dormir sur le canap\u00e9\\\" [he likes sleeping on the couch]; taking negations into account; Etc.\\n\\nAnother direction of research is the analysis of the orientation of the concepts by studying the polarity of the sentiment (positive or negative) and the strength of the sentiment of the lemmas, clauses, and texts collected. A fine-grained analysis of sentiment at the clause level involves the analysis of words, phrases (n-grams), and texts. All levels will have to be considered for good modeling of compositional sentiment (children's collective sentiment).\\n\\nThe COSMOS data can be used for a variety of studies, and we hope it will be helpful to the language science research community.\\n\\n5.
