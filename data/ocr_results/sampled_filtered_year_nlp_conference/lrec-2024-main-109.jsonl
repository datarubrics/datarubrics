While corpora containing concessive discourse relations already exist, the distinctive feature of our study is that it aims to identify the concessive inferential relations by writing out the implicit presupposed inferences.

Introduction\\n\\nThe proper recognition and classification of discourse relations in text and speech are crucial as aspects of natural language understanding. This has been one of the fundamental challenges in computational linguistics as well as in linguistic semantics and pragmatics. One of the factors contributing to the difficulty is that a single conjunction (or connectives) may be polysemous and can express multiple discourse relationships.\\n\\nIn this study, we present the annotation of Japanese conjunctions, namely 'nagara' (\u306a\u304c\u3089), 'tsutsu' (\u3064\u3064), and 'tokorode' (\u3068\u3053\u308d\u3067), which may or may not be interpreted as concessive conjunctions depending on the context in which they appear. In performing the annotation of polysemous conjunctions, we pay special attention to the hidden inferences of concessive discourse relations. Language resources of this kind are crucial for advancing linguistics-oriented research in NLP, and this study represents an effort to explore discourse relations in Japanese. We publicly release all annotation results at https://github.com/kmineshima/JDTB-logic.\\n\\n2. Background and Related Work\\n\\n2.1. Concession and presupposed inference\\n\\nBy the term 'concession' we mean a discourse relation that is often described as the \\\"denial of expectation\\\" (Kehler, 2002; Izutsu, 2008; Winterstein, 2012). It is worth noting that there are two distinct categories of concessive relations, as exemplified in the following sentences, taken from Izutsu (2008) (37):\\n\\n(1) Direct type\\n\\nAlthough John is poor, he is happy.\\n\\n(2) Indirect type\\n\\nThe car is stylish and spacious, but it is expensive.\\n\\nThe distinction between the direct and indirect types of concession is based on the nature of the presupposed inferences. In the direct type, as illustrated in (1), there is an implicit inference: \\\"If John is poor, then normally he is not happy.\\\" This presupposed inference is schematically represented as \\\"If P, then normally \u00acQ.\\\" On the other hand, the indirect type is characterized by the presupposition: \\\"If P then R; if Q then \u00acR,\\\" where the third proposition, R, is introduced. In the case of (2), this can be paraphrased as: \\\"If the car is stylish and spacious, then we would buy it; but if it is expensive, then we would not buy it.\\\"\\n\\nConcessive constructions and their presupposed inferences have been extensively discussed in the literature, including analyses of French (Anscombre and Ducrot, 1977), English (K\u00f6nig, 1985; Winter and Rimon, 1994; Iten, 1998; Winterstein, 2012; Toosarvandani, 2014), and Japanese discourse structures (Sakahara, 1985; Noya, 2003; Izutsu, 2008). However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no prior corpus study that has attempted to annotate concessive discourse relations with an emphasis on presupposed inference. In this paper, we aim to annotate and analyze such relations in Japanese, specifically from the perspective of presupposed inference.\"}"}

However, it is essential to note that the type of predicate alone does not always determine whether it is Synchronous or Concession. The interpretation is significantly influenced by the semantic relationship with the main clause and the contextual factors, as demonstrated in the following examples (excerpted from Section 3.4 of Japanese Descriptive Grammar Research Group (2008))\\n\\n(3) a.

Despite such difference, \u2018tokorode\u2019 is in the same situation as \u2018nagara\u2019 and \u2018tsutsu\u2019 in that interpretation of the conjunction is polysemous. This study aims to elucidate the factors that influence or correlate with the interpretation of polysemous conjunctions. Particular attention is paid to the factors that lead to the Concession interpretation.\\n\\n2.4. Annotated Corpus of Discourse Relations\\n\\nOne of the prominent studies on English discourse relations corpora is the Penn Discourse Treebank (PDTB) (Prasad et al., 2008, 2014). In PDTB-3 (Webber et al., 2019), a distinction is made between explicit and non-explicit discourse relations. For explicit discourse relations, each conjunctive expression is assigned a discourse relation unit (Arg1, Arg2) and a discourse relation label.\\n\\n(7) The documents also said that although [Arg2 the 64-year-old Mr. Cray has been working on the project for more than six years], [Arg1 the Cray-3 machine is at least another year away from a fully operational prototype]. [wsj 0018] (Prasad et al., 2008, 2014) (104) (Concession)\\n\\nThere are two similar but distinct labels Concession and Contrast, both of which fall under the Comparison relation. It has been noted that the distinction between Concession and Contrast is often not straightforward (Webber et al., 2019), which indicates that it is not always easy to identify Concession.\\n\\nIn the case of Japanese, there is a corpus called the Kyoto University Web Document Leads Corpus (Hangyo et al., 2012; Kawahara et al., 2014; Comparison.Concession.Arg1-as-denier, to be more precise.)\"}"}

This approach helps mitigate the difficulties associated with identifying discourse units and assigning linguistically valid discourse relation labels.\\n\\n3. Annotation Methodology\\n\\n3.1. Data Used\\n\\nAll sentences used in this study were extracted from the Kainoki Treebank (Kainoki (2022)), which comprises 102,875 Japanese trees. An example of the trees is shown in Figure 1.\\n\\nThe Kainoki Treebank provides both part-of-speech tags and syntactic structures. As a result, it is possible not only to extract sentences containing the strings \u306a\u304c\u3089 (nagara), \u3064\u3064 (tsutsu), and \u3068\u3053\u308d\u3067 (tokorode), but also to identify the two discourse units (Arg1 and Arg2) that these conjunctions take, even in complex sentences that include embedded clauses. For instance, in the example in Figure 1, Arg1 and Arg2 are \u4e8b\u52d9\u80fd\u529b\u3092\u767a\u63ee\u3057 (the woman exhibiting her clerical skills) and \u4e00\u4e2d\u5fc3\u3068\u306a\u3063\u3066 (working as the centerpiece of the family), respectively. Arg1 is governed by the IP node directly above \u3064\u3064 (tsutsu), while Arg2 is governed by the IP node that directly dominates the tsutsu clause.\\n\\n3.2. Discourse Relation Labels\\n\\nSentences containing the expressions \u306a\u304c\u3089 (nagara), \u3064\u3064 (tsutsu), and \u3068\u3053\u308d\u3067 (tokorode) numbered 1325, 239, and 108 sentences, respectively.\\n\\nAnnotations were carried out by 11 people for nagara and tsutsu and 5 people for tokorode, including the authors. All are with expertise in Japanese language. Two annotators independently labeled each triple of the form (Arg1, Conn, Arg2), where \u201cConn\u201d is the target conjunction. The annotators referred to the context before and after the target clauses as needed, using the Kainoki Treebank web interface.\\n\\nFor nagara and tsutsu, we use the following labels.\\n\\nConcession: This label is used when there is a \u201cdenial of expectation,\u201d that is, when Arg2 can be interpreted to deny the expectation raised by Arg1. See (3a) and (4a) as examples. The expressions nagaramo (\u306a\u304c\u3089\u3082) and tsutsumo (\u3064\u3064\u3082) are always used to express a concessive interpretation. Based on this test, the instructions specify that when nagara and tsutsu can be replaced with nagaramo and tsutsumo, respectively, without changing the meaning of the sentence, the concession label should be used.\\n\\nSynchronous: This label is used when the Concession interpretation is impossible and there is a temporal overlap between the events described by Arg1 and Arg2. See (3b) and (4b) as examples. The instructions specify that when nagara and tsutsu can be replaced with nagaramo and tsutsumo in a way that changes the meaning of the sentence, the Synchronous label should be used.\\n\\nIdiom: This label is used for idiomatic expressions such as \u6b8b\u5ff5\u306a\u304c\u3089 (regrettably).\\n\\nIn the Kainoki Treebank, the conjunction tokorode (\u3068\u3053\u308d\u3067) is tokenized into tokoro (\u3068\u3053\u308d) and de (\u3067). This form is lexically distinguished from a single expression tokorode (\u3068\u3053\u308d\u3067) that means by the way in English. In regard to tokoro, it is further distinguished by its part of speech tag into formal noun (labeled as FN) and common noun (labeled as N). The class under consideration here pertains to instances where its part of speech tag is a common noun (N), and the total count of such instances was 108.\"}"}

This additional task of writing out presuppositional inferences, despite being somewhat difficult at times, eventually revealed interesting cases in which it was not clear what specific inferences were being presupposed, leading to a reconsideration of the nature of concessions in human language.\\n\\n4. Annotation Results and Discussion\\n\\nThe number of cases for each classification label is shown in Table 1. If the judgment labels of the two annotators differed, a third annotator checked and determined the label. In cases where a decision still could not be made, they were classified as \\\"A/B.\\\" The inter-rater agreement between the two annotators was calculated using Kappa coefficient and was 0.72 for \u306a\u304c\u3089, 0.46 for \u3064\u3064, and 0.75 for tokorode, respectively.\\n\\n4.1. Characteristics of Concession\\n\\nThe use of \u306a\u304c\u3089 and \u3064\u3064 to indicate Concession typically depends on whether the predicate is dynamic or static, although there are exceptions.\\n\\nIt is not clear why the Kappa value for \u3064\u3064 is lower than those for \u306a\u304c\u3089 and tokorode. The low kappa value for \u3064\u3064 may be attributed to the complexity of the annotation instructions compared to those for '\u306a\u304c\u3089' and 'tokorode', which possibly led to confusion among the annotators. Specifically, there were instances where annotators mistakenly categorized examples as 'CONCESSION (indirect type)' that should have been identified as 'SYNCHRONOUS'.\"}"}

Each of these occurrences was automatically extracted and counted from the Kainoki Treebank. The results are summarized in Table 2.\\n\\nThese feature labels are not exclusive. We also counted the number of cases in which multiple labels overlap in a single sentence for each pattern. For example, in the case of a sentence containing *nagara* with characteristics of aspect (ASP), it can be extracted using the search interface on the Kainoki Treebank website with the search query \\\"P-CONN < (\u306a\u304c\u3089,\u304a\u304d|\u3044|\u3042\u308a)|\\\".\\n\\nAs a result, we did not find a single case of overlap in \\\"\u3064\u3064 (tsutsu)\\\". In \\\"\u306a\u304c\u3089 (nagara)\\\", we found a total of 23 cases of overlap, with the notable ones being ASP-NEG in four cases, and NEG-FOC and ASP-QUE in three cases. And, in \\\"\u3068\u3053\u308d\u3067 (tokorode)\\\", a total of 16 cases of label overlap were found, with the NEG-FOC pattern being the most frequent (11 cases).\\n\\nBelow, we discuss a few points found in Table 2 that we believe are worth noting from a linguistic perspective. We do not discuss *tsutsu* much, since it is less clear if there is any prominent characteristic to point out, which could be due to the small total number.\\n\\nFirst, we can confirm that \\\"\u306a\u304c\u3089 (nagara)\\\" is likely to be interpreted as concession when the predicate of Arg1 represents a static state, e.g., \\\"(\u3066)tei-\u306a\u304c\u3089 (beating nagara)\\\" instead of \\\"(\u3066)\u306a\u304c\u3089 (eat nagara)\\\". While there are 31 out of 146 cases that have a static predicate for those that are labeled as *Concession*, there are only 3 out of 1046 cases when Arg2 does not have a static predicate. This tendency was not observed for \\\"\u3068\u3053\u308d\u3067 (tokorode)\\\".\\n\\nA significant characteristic shared by \\\"\u306a\u304c\u3089 (nagara)\\\" and \\\"\u3068\u3053\u308d\u3067 (tokorode)\\\" becomes clear to see the cases where negation appears in Arg2.

In the case of (19), (20), and (21), the negation contained in Arg2 strongly suggests a concessive relation.\\n\\n4.2.2. Concession: Indirect type\\n\\nFor the examples labelled as Concession, an additional analysis was conducted by the authors to determine whether or not they are instances of the indirect type in the sense described in Section 2.1. There were few examples that clearly fit into the indirect type. The following is one such example.\\n\\n(22) \\n\\n\u30a2\u30a4\u30cc\u306e\u5d07\u62dd\u3059\u308b\u5c71\u306e\u4e2d\u306b\u306f\u3001\u5927\u6614\u6d2a\u6c34\u306e\u6642\u3001\u72ed\u3044\u306a\u304c\u3089\u3082\u4e7e\u3044\u305f\u5834\u6240\u304c\u3042\u3063\u3066\u3001\u305d\u308c\u3067\u5148\u7956\u306e\u4eba\u304c\u52a9\u304b\u3063\u305f\u306e\u3067...\\n\\nPresupposed Inference: If it is narrow, then it is usually not dry.\\n\\nIn this case, it is unlikely that the assumption \\\"if it is narrow, then it is usually not dry\\\" is implicit. Therefore, the direct type of inference \\\"If P, then normally \u00acQ\\\" is not presupposed. Instead, it should be interpreted as an indirect type, taking into account an implicit third proposition, such as \\\"It's narrow, so they wouldn't have been saved, but it was dry, so they were saved.\\\"\\n\\nAnother example that conveys a sense of opposition, yet poses challenges in formulating a direct type of inference is the following.\\n\\n(23) \\n\\n\u306a\u306b\u304b\u8a71\u3055\u306d\u3070\u3068\u601d\u306a\u304c\u3089\u3001\u307e\u305f\u75b2\u52b4\u306b\u4f3c\u305f\u6182\u9b31\u3092\u611f\u3058\u3066\u3044\u305f\u3002\\n\\nPresupposed Inference: It is generally expected that if you believe you should say something, it is better to do so. However, this assumption does not align with the presupposition of the direct type (\\\"If P, then normally \u00acQ\\\"). The conflict in this case is intuitively associated with a modal aspect. Arg1 seems to convey a sense of obligation derived from the modal should, which indicates the situation where you are required to say something. However, Arg2 only expresses the feeling of fatigue. To accurately interpret the entire sentence, Arg2 can be understood as \\\"I felt a melancholy similar to fatigue, therefore I could not say anything.\\\" The proposition in italics that is inferred from the context contradicts the expectation raised by Arg1. This represents the underlying structure of the presupposed inference of the indirect concessives in this case.\\n\\n4.3. Other Difficult Cases of Articulating Presupposed Inferences\\n\\nWe have defined the Concession relation as one in which there exists a presupposed inference, either in the direct form \\\"If P, then (normally) \u00acQ\\\" or in the indirect form \\\"If P then R and if Q then \u00acR\\\" (Section 2.1). However, when examining annotated examples, we encountered cases for which it was challenging to assign the correct label, and there were instances that initially seem to be Concession but posed difficulties when trying to articulate the presupposed inferences. These instances are of particular interest.\\n\\n4.3.1. Types of Modality in the Presupposed Inferences\\n\\nThe task of writing out presupposed inferences revealed some cases where it is essential to interpret a hidden modality that is not mentioned in the text. For example, in the following case, by mechanically applying the template \\\"If P, then \u00acQ\\\" will result in an inference like (24a). However, in this context, it is more appropriate to have an inference like (24b) with a deontic modality (should) rather than with a stereotypical modality (usually) in (24a).\\n\\n(24) \\n\\nArg1 \u907a\u5bb6\u65cf\u3068\u3042\u308c\u3070\u4e00\u5c64\u4fdd\u8b77\u3092\u52a0\u3079\u304d\u4efb\u306b\u3042\u308a\u306a\u304c\u3089\u3001\\n\\nArg2 \u8272\u3068\u617e\u306e\u4e8c\u7b4b\u3092\u304b\u3051\u308b\u306a\u3069\u5b9f\u969b\u306b\u8a00\u8a9e\u9053\u65ad\u3067\u3059\u3002\"}"}

If there is a duty to provide even more protection, one should not pursue both paths of lust and desire.\\n\\nSuch examples suggest that we are flexible in interpreting contextual background and supplementing it with appropriate modalities as needed when understanding discourse relations.\\n\\n4.3.2. Binary Classification of Synchronous and Concession\\n\\nSynchronous and Concession interpretations are not mutually exclusive; there are cases where the sentence can be interpreted in both ways at the same time. For example, in the case below, it is Synchronous in that the two events of running away and shouting happened simultaneously. At the same time, it is Concession too, since the conjunction is \\\"\u306a\u304c\u3089\u3082\\\" (nagara mo) with mo attached, instead of \\\"\u306a\u304c\u3089\\\" (nagara), which indicates that it must be interpreted as Concession.\\n\\n(25) [Arg1\u9003\u3052\u3066\u3044\u304d\u306a\u304c\u3089\u3082\u3001Arg2\u300c\u3072\u3083\u3042\uff01\u300d\u3068\u53eb\u3093\u3060\u3002] (421_aozora_Harada-1960)\\n\\n'While [Arg1 running away], [Arg2 he/she still shouted, \\\"Hyaa!\\\"]'\\n\\nWhile the typical use of nagara is either Concession or Synchronous, the temporal interpretation (whether it is synchronous or asynchronous) and the inferential interpretation (whether it is Concessive or not) are independent. This results in a greater variety of interpretations, such as \\\"Synchronous & Concession.\\\" This perspective, also mentioned in Muraki (2019), suggests that the binary classification of Synchronous and Concession is not adequate and that there is a need for independent classification for temporal and inferential discourse relations.\\n\\n4.3.3. Contrast\\n\\nConcession often accompanies a sense of contrast, and distinguishing between the two is not always straightforward (Section 2.4). In PDTB-3, criteria have been established for labeling Concession and Contrast, and in cases where both Concession and Contrast apply, priority is given to the former (Webber et al., 2019).\\n\\nDuring our annotation process, we also observed the difficulty of distinguishing between concession and contrast. For example, by applying the template of the direct type of concession to the following case to write out the presupposed inference, we get an inference like in (26a). However, \\\"\u304a\u3060\u3066\u308b\\\" (odateru) (flatter) carries a nuance of flattering someone not out of genuine respect but rather with some ulterior motive, to make the other person feel good through excessive praise. This nuance makes the presupposition inappropriate.\\n\\n(26) \u300c\u672c\u571f\u306e\u4eba\u304c\u3001[Arg1\u6c96\u7e04\u3092\u304a\u3060\u3066\u308b\u306a\u304c\u3089\u3001Arg2\u307b\u3093\u3068\u3046\u306f\u304a\u4eba\u597d\u3057\u306e\u30d0\u30ab\u3060\u3068\u601d\u3046\u3067\u3057\u3087]\u300d (494_fiction_onna_to_senso)\\n\\n'People in the mainland, while [Arg1 flattering Okinawa], [Arg2 probably really think they are naive fools, don't they?]\\n\\na. If the mainland people flatter Okinawa, they usually do not really think the Okinawa people are naive fools.\\n\\nb. (On the surface) the mainland people flatter Okinawa, but actually, they think the Okinawa people are naive fools (in their minds).\\n\\nIf we consider this case to be a contrast, we can see a contrasting relationship between \\\"on the surface\\\" vs. \\\"actually/in their minds\\\" and \\\"flattering\\\" vs. \\\"thinking they are naive fools\\\" as in (26b). Thus, although there may be some overlaps between contrast and concession, they must be kept distinct from the perspective of presupposed inferences. Otherwise, we will end up having an inappropriate inference if we cannot identify the correct discourse relation.\\n\\n4.3.4.
