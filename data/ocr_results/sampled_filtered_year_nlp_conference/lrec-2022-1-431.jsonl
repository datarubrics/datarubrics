Introduction\\nRecently, as dialogue systems become part of our daily lives, towards more advanced dialogue systems, researchers have been working on dialogue systems that can collaborate with humans to complete tasks (Meena et al., 2014; He et al., 2017; Kim et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2021).\\n\\nMany studies related to collaborative work with dialogue systems use Minecraft (Szlam et al., 2019). Minecraft is a sandbox-type 3D game in which the player controls an avatar and can move freely in the world. It also supports multiplayer, making it easy for multiple players to collaborate in the same environment.\\n\\nMost studies using Minecraft have focused on problem-solving collaborative work (Narayan-Chen et al., 2019; Ogawa et al., 2020; Bara et al., 2021), and few studies have focused on creative collaborative work. To realize a society in which humans and systems can create new value, it is essential that systems and users can work together on creative collaborative work.\\n\\nThis study collected data on creative collaborative work between humans in Minecraft as a basis for developing a dialogue system that enables creative collaborative work. We devised the Collaborative Garden Task and collected text chats, action logs, and questionnaire results. We also collected third-person evaluations of the created gardens scored in terms of originality and beauty in order to objectively assess the quality of the collaboration. Furthermore, we analyzed the relationship between dialogue and collaborative work that received high scores on the subjective and third-person evaluations in order to identify dialogic factors for high-quality collaborative work. The contributions of the paper are as follows.\\n\\n\u2022 We collected 500 human-human dialogues on creative collaborative work by using Minecraft; the data contain text chat, action logs, and subjective/objective questionnaire results.\\n\u2022 We found that, for collaborative work, performing more processes to ask for and agree on suggestions between workers is essential.\\n\u2022 We discovered that agreeing on a particular image of the final product in the early phase of work and then discussing changes and details is also essential.\\n\\n2. Related Work\\nRegarding collaboration with dialogue systems, a system that manages network traffic flows through interaction with a user (Lochbaum et al., 1990), a system that collaboratively solves problems to plan evacuations (Ferguson and Allen, 1998), and a system that negotiates procedures for abstracted action through interaction to achieve a common goal (Sidner, 1994) have been proposed. In addition, COLLAGEN (Rich and Sidner, 1999) can collaborate with a user in manipulating software such as a video cassette recorder or a gas turbine simulator. PLOW (Allen et al., 2007) can collaborate with the user to search for information, book flights, and purchase books on a web browser by following the user's instructions on operating the web browser. Meena et al. (2014) developed a system that can perform the Map Task (Anderson et al., 1991) with users. In the Map Task, two workers play the roles of an information provider and an information follower. The information provider gives an explanation on the basis\"}"}

The system that these researchers developed acts as the information follower, and it acquires the necessary information by interacting with the user (i.e., the information provider) in order to complete the map.\\n\\nMany of the recent studies on collaboration with dialogue systems use Minecraft. Inspired by the Map Task, Ogawa et al. (2020) devised the Mansion Task, in which two workers receive different maps and try to reach the destination by exchanging the information on the maps. There are various obstacles, such as needing to press buttons simultaneously, along the way, and the workers need to work together to pass these obstacles. Bara et al. (2021) devised a task called MindCraft, in which two workers receive different craft recipes and create target items by exchanging information on item creation. They collected dialogues and workers' belief states by asking them explicitly about their belief states at periodic intervals in the dialogues, and they developed a model for predicting these states. Narayan-Chen et al. (2019) devised the Collaborative Building Task, in which two workers play the roles of an Architect and a Builder and create a target structure in accordance with their roles. The Architect has a blueprint of the target structure and instructs the Builder on how to manipulate the blocks on the basis of the blueprint. The Builder manipulates the blocks following the instructions given by the Architect and creates the structure. Kohn et al. (2020) and Jayannavar et al. (2020) collected such dialogue data and developed a model that generates block operations on the basis of instructions in the Collaborative Building Task. These studies focus on problem-solving, not creative collaborative work.\\n\\nFew studies focus on creative collaborative work in environments that represent the real world, such as Minecraft. In this study, we focus on the Collaborative Garden Task and collect data such as text chats and action logs with the aim of developing a dialogue system that enables creative collaborative work.\\n\\nA study that may resemble ours may be that by Mitsuda et al. (2022), who used a design task to lay objects out collaboratively; however, they used a simplistic interface with icons as objects, and the workers had individual layouts as their views in order to examine their mutual understanding through text chat, which is different from our setting in which people collaborate to create the same object in the same space.\\n\\n3. Collaborative Garden Task Corpus\\n\\nWe collected data on human interactions during collaborative work in Minecraft. This section describes the Collaborative Garden Task, the data collection experiment we conducted, the dialogue data we collected, and the third-person evaluations. Note that we collected the data in Japanese. We obtained the approval of the ethics committee of our university to conduct the data collection experiment with regard to the usage of the data as well as the treatment of the personal information.\\n\\n3.1. Collaborative Garden Task\\n\\nWe conceived the Collaborative Garden Task, in which two workers work together to create a unique and beautiful garden. By using a garden as a target, we considered it possible to balance the difficulty between creation and variation. As criteria, we used originality and beauty, which depend on individual values, to allow the workers to work creatively through discussions. Workers interacted via text chat and manipulated blocks. We set the building area to ten squares in length and width and four squares in height. As shown in Figure 1, we placed \\\"grass blocks,\\\" which correspond to lawn, in the bottom 10 \u00d7 10 squares in advance. The workers could use only 17 types of blocks such as \\\"grass blocks,\\\" \\\"oak leaves,\\\" and \\\"bricks.\\\" There was no limit on the number of blocks. The time limit for the work was 20 minutes, and workers worked up to the time limit. From our observation, few pairs were unable to complete the garden within the time limit.\\n\\n3.2. Data Collection Procedure\\n\\nWe used Minecraft Java Edition version 1.16.5 for data collection and SpigotMC for the data collection platform. SpigotMC is an extension server for Minecraft, allowing us to customize the Minecraft environment with plug-ins. Some studies have used Malmo (Johnsson et al., 2016) as a data collection platform (Narayan-Chen et al., 2019; Ogawa et al., 2020). However, it requires an additional step to introduce extensions to the client-side; therefore, we chose SpigotMC in this study.\\n\\nThe workers first joined the server and entered the Lobby World, which served as a waiting room where they waited until their partners arrived. Once the partner arrived, the workers created a new experiment room with a type-in command, and each pair moved to the experiment room. There was a separate text chat for each experiment room so that multiple pairs could work simultaneously. After moving to the experiment room, workers could start the Collaborative Garden Task. The timer displayed on the screen started running when the task started. Five minutes before the end of the timer, workers received an announcement of the remaining time. In addition, when they ran out of assigned time, they received a notification that the time was over. This was the process for one collaborative work session, which we refer to as one dialogue.\\n\\n3.3. Data Specifications\\n\\nWe collected data on the text chats, block placement and removal, and player movement. All collected actions consisted of the following:\\n\\n- timestamp when the action was performed\\n- player's position such as their coordinates (x, y, z) and viewpoint (yaw, pitch)\"}"}

In addition, they answered a questionnaire about their satisfaction with the dialogue and the created garden after each work session. Here, we used a five-point Likert scale.\\n\\nFigure 2: Workers' experience with Minecraft\\n\\n- Less than 6 months: 11.4%\\n- 6 months to 1 year: 11.4%\\n- 1 to 2 years: 10.1%\\n- 2 to 5 years: 30.4%\\n- More than 5 years: 36.7%\\n\\n3.4. Collected Data\\nTable 1 shows the statistics of the 500 dialogues collected in this study. Seventy-nine people recruited by crowd-sourcing participated in the experiment, and each worker worked an average of 12.7 times and a maximum of 24 times. Different pairs worked together in each work session. The working time was about 25 minutes, and the workers were paid 585 yen (approx. 5 dollars) per session.\\n\\nFigure 2 shows the workers' experience with Minecraft. About three-fourths of the workers had been playing for more than one year. As for the experience of working together to create buildings in Minecraft, most workers had been playing for more than 2 years. In the questionnaire, workers were asked about their experience in working together to create buildings. The results are shown in Figure 2.\"}"}

Table 4 shows the mean and standard deviations of the obtained scores. The mean score for originality was 4.84 with a standard deviation of 0.73, and that for beauty was 4.32 with a standard deviation of 0.75. In the third-person evaluations, a rating of four means a middle-rated garden, and five means a relatively good one. Although the scores were not as high as those of the subjective evaluations, the third-person evaluations also confirmed the good quality of the collaborative work.\\n\\nAs an analysis to develop a dialogue system that enables the Collaborative Garden Task to be done, we analyzed the dialogic factors that enable high-quality collaboration.\\n\\n4.1. Expressions Useful for Collaboration\\n\\nWe first performed an analysis on the basis of word frequency. We classified all 500 dialogues into the top 20% and the bottom 80% on the basis of three classification criteria: one was the sum of the scores of the seven subjective evaluations (satisfaction), and two were the third-person evaluations (originality and beauty) of the gardens.\\n\\nFocusing on word 4-grams that contain at least one content word, we first listed the top 300 frequent such 4-grams in the 16,221 collected utterances from our data. Then, we mined frequent 4-grams that appeared in the high-quality dialogues. More specifically, we used Fisher's exact test to verify whether the expressions frequently appeared in the top 20% of dialogues. We used Janome 5 as a Japanese morphological analyzer to extract words from utterances. We created a 2\u00d72 cross table of the 500 dialogues with one axis indicating whether a dialogue included a specific word 4-gram and the other indicating whether a dialogue was among the high-quality dialogues, and we conducted a Fisher's exact test on them. Table 5 shows the expressions identified by test.\\n\\nTwo main types of expressions frequently appeared in dialogues for which satisfaction was high. The first was expressions that ask for a partner's agreement, such as \\\"would you like?\\\", \\\"let's try,\\\" and \\\"how about?\\\" These expressions appear when suggesting an idea to a partner or deciding on a work plan. The dialogue shown in Table 2 was in the top 20% of satisfaction, and we can see expressions such as \\\"This side, is this okay?\\\" and \\\"Can I try to put a chair at the two trees?\\\"\\n\\nThe second was expressions showing positive appreciation toward the partner, such as \\\"that's right\\\" and \\\"great!\\\" These expressions show positive appreciation and agreement with a partner's opinion or what the partner created. In Table 2, we can see expressions such as \\\"Sounds good!\\\" \\\"It's good!\\\", and \\\"No... that's okay!\\\"\\n\\nAs for the dialogues with high third-person evaluations, we observed similar kinds of expressions. Regarding originality, we obtained two expressions, \\\"how about?\\\" and \\\"it looks like.\\\" \\\"How about?\\\" is an expression that asks for a partner's agreement on one's own suggestion. We obtained six expressions regarding beauty. These expressions, such as \\\"would you like?\\\" and \\\"let's try,\\\"\"}"}

In addition, \u201clooks nice\u201d is an expression of positive appreciation toward the partner.\\n\\nIn summary, we can see quite a few expressions of agreement, indicating the importance of performing more processes to ask for and agree on suggestions between workers in collaborative work.\\n\\n4.2. Analysis of Collaboration Process\\n\\nWe investigated which types of dialogue lead to high-quality collaboration. To analyze the progress being made in the collaboration, we plotted the gardens\u2019 progress on the basis of the completion rate (see Eq. 1) and conducted a cluster analysis to find patterns in the collaboration process.\\n\\nConsidering that the final layout of the blocks was the result of the agreement between the workers, we could use the existence of these blocks at time $t$ as a measure to calculate the completion rate.\\n\\nCompletion Rate\\n\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\text{Completion Rate} = \\\\frac{|\\\\text{Blocks}_t \\\\cap \\\\text{Blocks}_{\\\\text{last}}|}{|\\\\text{Blocks}_{\\\\text{last}}|} \\\\tag{1}\\n\\\\]\\n\\n$\\\\text{Blocks}_t$ represents the set of blocks installed at time $t$, and $\\\\text{Blocks}_{\\\\text{last}}$ represents the set of blocks used in the final garden. We used the time-series data of the completion rate at the time of an utterance and conducted a cluster analysis on it. We used a k-means based method, k-Shape (Paparrizos and Gravano, 2015), for clustering, and following Mitsuda et al. (2022), we normalized the completion rate to follow a normal distribution with mean 0 and variance 1 in advance. We used the Elbow method to determine the number of clusters. Since there were several clusters in which the sum of squares of intra-cluster errors stopped decreasing, one of the authors manually checked the number of clusters and determined it to be six.\\n\\nFigure 3 shows the clusters we obtained. Cluster 1 accounted for 4.4%, Cluster 2 for 19.6%, Cluster 3 for 16.4%, Cluster 4 for 3.0%, Cluster 5 for 32.2%, and Cluster 6 for 24.4% of the total.\\n\\nIn Clusters 1 and 4, the completion rate increased rapidly in the last phase. This happened because there were few utterances in the middle phase. In dialogues in these clusters, the workers seemed to have continued to work silently after deciding what to make through discussion in the early phase.\\n\\nIn Clusters 3 and 5, the completion rate increased significantly in the middle phase. In particular, in Cluster 3, we can see a sharp increase in the completion rate in the middle phase. In contrast, in Cluster 5, the completion rate increased only slightly before the middle phase. We assume that in these clusters, the workers proceeded with the outline discussed in the early phase and discussed the details in the middle and later phases.\\n\\nThe increase in the completion rate for Clusters 2 and 6 was almost constant from the early to late phases. In these dialogues, the workers constantly interacted with each other, discussing and agreeing on the construction of the garden step by step.\\n\\n4.3. Relationship between Collaboration Process and Evaluations\\n\\nTo identify which cluster was associated with good collaboration, we investigated the frequency of high-quality dialogues within the clusters. To classify the dialogues by their quality, we used 11 evaluation criteria: the seven subjective evaluations, the sum of all subjective evaluations, and four objective evaluations.\"}"}

Clusters 3 and 5 are clusters in which the completion rate increased significantly in the middle.

From the analysis, we discovered that agreeing on a particular image of the final product in the early phase and then discussing the details to complete the garden is essential in both subjective and third-person evaluations. We consider it essential to develop skills for dialogue systems to be able to discuss basic concepts before creation and discuss the details while looking at the created objects.\\n\\n5. Conclusion and Future Work\\n\\nWe collected data on human interactions in the Collaborative Garden Task in Minecraft with the aim of developing a dialogue system that enables creative collaborative work. We collected subjective and third-person evaluations of dialogues and gardens and analyzed dialogic factors that were evaluated highly from several aspects. As a result, we discovered that, in creative collaborative work, it is essential to perform more processes to ask for and agree on suggestions between workers and to agree on a particular image of the final product in the early phase of work and then discuss changes and details.\\n\\nFor a dialogue system to demonstrate such behaviors, we need to develop technologies for the system to discuss ideas rather deeply at the beginning of work, having its own ideas and exchanging them with users. The system also needs the capability to agree on a concept. In addition, at the end of the collaboration, the system needs to understand the current product of the work and needs to discuss possible improvements with users, putting the final touches on the work. One straightforward experiment we can consider is to train an encoder-decoder model that can output user utterances on the basis of the state of the garden and the dialogue history. Eventually, we will work on developing a system that can creatively collaborate with users.\\n\\n6. Acknowledgments\\n\\nThis work was supported by JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number 19H05692.\"}"}
