The study of bias, fairness and social impact in Natural Language Processing (NLP) lacks resources in languages other than English. Our objective is to support the evaluation of bias in language models in a multilingual setting. We use stereotypes across nine types of biases to build a corpus containing contrasting sentence pairs, one sentence that presents a stereotype concerning an underadvantaged group and another minimally changed sentence, concerning a matching advantaged group. We build on the French CrowS-Pairs corpus and guidelines to provide translations of the existing material into seven additional languages. In total, we produce 11,139 new sentence pairs that cover stereotypes dealing with nine types of biases in seven cultural contexts. We use the final resource for the evaluation of relevant monolingual and multilingual masked language models. We find that language models in all languages favor sentences that express stereotypes in most bias categories. The process of creating a resource that covers a wide range of language types and cultural settings highlights the difficulty of bias evaluation, in particular comparability across languages and contexts.\\n\\nKeywords: ethics, biases, language models, multilingual\\n\\n1. Introduction\\n\\nRecent surveys of the literature on bias, fairness and social impact of Natural Language Processing (NLP) have identified a gap in the availability of tools and resources to study bias in languages other than English and social contexts outside the north of America (Blodgett et al., 2020; Talat et al., 2022). It was also noted that gender bias has attracted a lot of attention, compared to other types of bias (Ducel et al., 2023), thus highlighting the need for addressing a larger scope of biases. Through in-depth analysis of bias datasets, Blodgett et al. (2021) and Pikuliak et al. (2023) have identified different types of data quality issues as well as a lack of diversity: some bias categories such as gender and religion are well covered while other categories such as nationality are partially covered (with some over-represented nationalities and others that remain unaddressed) and other categories, such as political affiliation, are not covered at all. The problem of intersectionality (addressing combination of bias categories) also remains open. The bulk of the work conducted on bias in language models has addressed transformer models, and more specifically Masked Language Models (MLMs) introduced in 2017 (Vaswani et al., 2017) and popularized with the BERT family of models (Devlin et al., 2019). Recent work in NLP has massively focused on so-called Large Language Models (LLMs), in particular autoregressive models such as BLOOM (and: Tavenier Le Scao et al., 2023) or Vicuna (Chiang et al., 2023). It can be noted that the question of adapting bias evaluation frameworks designed for masked language models to these new models is still open. Nonetheless, it remains important to continue exploring bias evaluation for masked language models for at least two reasons: (1) these models are widely used in practical applications because they offer good performance/compute requirement balance; (2) studying the original context of the bias datasets will help further our understanding of bias modeling and measuring.\"}"}

For continuity with previous work, we build on the popular bias identification dataset CrowS-Pairs (Nangia et al., 2020) and enrich it with revisions of documented issues and translations to new languages. A team of more than 20 people (the authors of this paper) was involved in this project, resulting in the addition of seven new languages, related to seven different socio-cultural contexts: Arabic from Maghreb and the Arab world in general, Catalan from Spain, German from Germany, Spanish from Argentina, Italian from Italy, Maltese from Malta and simplified Chinese from China. These are added to the corrected English (from the United States) and French (from France) corpora released by N\u00e9v\u00e9ol et al., 2022.\\n\\nThe process of creating this linguistic resource uncovered the specific nature of the challenges arising from the translation of stereotypical sentences. Linguistic and cultural aspects are intricately intertwined and bear the mark of a task originally designed for English.\\n\\nThe main contributions of this work are:\\n\\n\u2022 The production of high-quality manual translations into seven new languages, constituting an extended resource for bias evaluation\\n\u2022 A revised version of the English and French datasets documenting non minimal pairs;\\n\u2022 Results of bias evaluation using the newly developed resources on 16 monolingual masked language models as well as the multilingual models mBERT and XLM-RoBERTa\\n\u2022 A discussion of practical challenges inherent to the endeavor of bias evaluation in multiple languages and cultural contexts\\n\\n2. Corpus development\\n\\nThis work builds on previous work around the CrowS-Pairs dataset, that we extend with content in seven languages as well as revised content in French and English.\\n\\nBias Types.\\n\\nWe use the nine categories of bias included in the CrowS-Pairs dataset: ethnicity/color, gender/gender identity or expression, socio-economic status/occupation, nationality, religion, age, sexual orientation, physical appearance, and disability. We decided to keep the CrowS-Pairs original set of bias categories as they were likely to be relevant in the new social contexts addressed and would support comparability of bias relevance across social contexts.\\n\\nTranslation.\\n\\nTranslations were based on the original CrowS-Pairs content and also used the additional content produced by N\u00e9v\u00e9ol et al. (2022), time permitting. Translators (the authors of the paper) are native speakers of the languages they worked with. They all have at least a Masters\u2019 degree in linguistics, NLP, or translation. English was used as the source language for all translations, (in other words, translations were all performed from English,) as it was the common language between everyone in the group. However, French speakers also secondarily relied on the French translations (e.g., for Arabic). We followed the methodology outlined by N\u00e9v\u00e9ol et al. (2022) where translators worked in pairs so that each sentence was translated by one person and validated or revised by another. We also made use of the variety of translation processes available, including adaptation of cultural context for items such as names, food or locations. Table 1 shows examples of stereotype translation into the nine languages covered by Multilingual CrowS-Pairs. It illustrates the diversity of situations we encountered: in the first example, the cultural reference to the Ku Klux Klan (KKK) could not be adapted to any social contexts outside the United States. In the second example, the stereotype targeting women\u2019s driving ability could be rendered using equivalent language across the different contexts. Finally, the third example presents a stereotype associating a given nationality with cooking habits. It often, but not always, required adaptation to populations closer to the target social context. The final number of sentence pairs per language varies depending on the number of sentences that were found impossible to translate.\\n\\nRevision.\\n\\nA number of issues with the original CrowS-Pairs dataset have been identified by Blodgett et al. (2021). Previous work by N\u00e9v\u00e9ol et al. (2022) attempted to address three issues described as \u201cbias type mismatch\u201d, \u201cdouble switch\u201d and \u201cnon minimal pairs\u201d and reported a low prevalence (150 sentences, or less than 10%) and suggested that revising problematic sentences did not have significant impact on bias evaluation. However, we noticed that the issues identified in previous analysis do not completely align and were not counted or addressed comprehensively. We identified a need to address all the issues reported that resulted in non minimal pairs in a systematic way. Thus, we use the most literal definition of non minimal pairs: pairs that are not strictly minimal, as they present more than one different token (e.g. the bias target is a multi-token expression, or there is another change in the sentence, on a non-target element). Therefore, in addition to the creation of new datasets, we reviewed 275 pairs from the English\"}"}

Specif-\\ncically, we used marBERT and araBERT (Abdul-\\nMageed et al., 2021) as well as CAMeLBERT (In-\\noue et al., 2021) for Arabic, JuliBERT and Cata-\\nlan RoBERTa for Catalan, German BERT (Chan\\net al., 2020) and German RoBERTa for German,\\nBETO (Ca\u00f1ete et al., 2020) for Spanish, BERT and\\nELECTRA models for Italian5, BERTu and mBERTu\\nfor Maltese6 (Micallef et al., 2022) and a Chinese\\nBERT base model using word piece segmentation\\nand two variants of BERT with Whole Word Mask-\\ning (Cui et al., 2020) for simplified Chinese.\\n\\nTable 3 presents the results of bias evaluation for\\nthe seven languages added to the Multilingual\\nCrowS-Pairs corpus.\\n\\nWhile we did not measure the specific envi-\\nronmental impact of each experiment, we used\\nthe Green Algorithm calculator v2.2 (Lannelongue\\net al., 2021)7 to estimate the impact. Bias evalua-\\ntion on one model took on average 15 minutes of\\na single GPU compute time (and drew 85.10 Wh),\\nwhich amounts to a minimum carbon footprint of\\n4.36 g CO2e and carbon sequestration of 4.76e-03\\ntree-months8.\\n\\nThe overall metric score for monolingual models\\nis often higher than that of multilingual models for\\nthe same language, but there are exceptions (e.g.\\naraBERT vs. mBERT and XLM-RoBERTa, BETO\\nvs. mBERT).\\n\\n4. Discussion\\nScaling up. This work attempted to scale up a re-\\nsource addressing two languages and cultural con-\\ntexts to nine language/context pairs. Some issues\\nthat can be addressed within a language pair can-\\nnot necessarily spread out across nine languages.\\nThis lack of uniformity could arise either from lin-\\nguistic constraints (e.g., making word choices to\\ncreate minimal pairs was a strategy that could work\\nto align two languages, but required different se-\\nmantic drifts or relaxing the minimal pair constraint\\nat scale) or cultural constraints (e.g., some stereo-\\ntypical situations could only be conveyed in a sub-\\nset of the nine languages/context pairs).\\n\\nModel architecture. In this study we evaluated\\nbias in 16 monolingual models and two multiling-\\nual models implementing a variety of architectures\\nincluding BERT and RoBERTa. The results pre-\\nsented in Table 3 seem to suggest that bias scores\\nare overall higher in RoBERTa vs. BERT models.\\n\\n5. Conclusion\\nWe present a revised and extended version for the\\nCrowS-Pairs challenge dataset. It will be made\\navailable as a complement to the original resource.\\nThe corpus uses the minimal pair paradigm to cover\\nnine categories of bias. Our experiments show that\\nmost monolingual MLMs in the 7 languages/context\\npairs addressed exhibit significant bias. The pro-\\ncess of extending CrowS-Pairs from English and\\nFrench to seven additional languages and cultural\\ncontexts is a challenging endeavor.\\n\\nThis paper aims at introducing an extended bias\\nevaluation resource that could be used to con-\\nduct further experiments and analysis. We leave\\nbroader application of the resource to the commu-\\nnity and/or for future work.\\n\\n6.
