Introduction\\n\\nLanguage resources based on parliamentary records are gaining increasing attention from NLP and social science scholars (Eide, 2020; Erjavec et al., 2021; Escribano et al., 2022; Abrami et al., 2022). Derived from the French word parler (\u201cto talk\u201d), parliaments have long been a main venue for open and public debates. The systematic documentation of such a major political arena for public deliberation provides a wealth of research opportunities for scholars from all areas of academic research.\\n\\nIn parliaments that speak low-resource languages (such as Hebrew), these resources are of particular importance, since they provide a rare opportunity to gather spoken language corpora (Agi\u0107 and Vuli\u0107, 2019).\\n\\nParliaments have never been the only venue for public political communication. For example, a long history of political communication research that goes back to the classical work of Laswell (1948) paid attention to the use of mass media by politicians (Barber\u00e1 and Zeitzoff, 2018). The use of social media for political communication has received an increasing amount of attention in recent years (Barber\u00e1 and Zeitzoff, 2018). Social media has been studied as a communication platform for politicians, providing them with an alternative outlet for sending messages and setting political agenda (Gilardi et al., 2022). Twitter, in particular, has been shown to offer such opportunities for members of parliament, providing a way to circumvent constraints present in other communication outlets, as well as providing a way to \u2018amplify\u2019 party messages (Silva and Proksch, 2022).\\n\\nWith this in mind, we introduce IsraParlTweet, a new digital language resource that documents Knesset (Israeli parliament) discussions over the years 1992-2023, as well as Twitter posts by Knesset members in the years 2008-2023. The text is augmented by rich meta-data such as personal details, political roles & affiliations, and Twitter statistics, allowing a diverse array of possible statistical analyses. In addition to exploring each of the communication outlets separately, the significant overlap in time periods allows fascinating explorations and analyses of the inter-connections and interactions of members\u2019 expressions in the Knesset vs. their expressions in Twitter. Consisting of a total of 294.5 million tokens in Hebrew, IsraParlTweet is also one of the largest catalogued language resources in a language that has very few such resources available for researchers.\\n\\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides a short description of the Knesset and its relevant aspects covered by the corpus. Section 3 describes the process of creating the corpus. Section 4 contains a detailed description of the corpus. Section 5 provides details on several statistical analyses performed on the data as well as a discussion of the results. Finally, Section 6 provides a conclusion to the paper.\\n\\n2. The Knesset\\n\\nIsrael is a parliamentary democracy. The Israeli parliament, \u201cThe Knesset\u201d, is a unicameral legislature with 120 members of Knesset (MKs) elected in general elections (Galnoor and Blander, 2018; Hazan, 2022). The Knesset elections are supposed to take place every four years, but early elections are very common. The Israeli electoral system is characterized by three major features: a proportional allocation formula; the use of a single nationwide\"}"}

The Israeli political system is regarded as a prototype of a PR (proportional representation) system (Hazan et al., 2017) and its multi-party system is characterized by intense ideological competition (Oshri et al., 2021). Party lists represented in the Knesset range between 8 (the 2020 elections) and 15 (the 1999 elections). The number of parties represented in the Knesset can be even higher when lists have more than one party or when parties split during a Knesset term (Kenig and Rahat, 2023). As a result, the Knesset reflects the heterogeneity of Israeli society. There are usually three Knesset plenary meetings each week: on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays. Knesset meetings are conducted in Hebrew, but Members can speak in other languages and the protocol will include translations into Hebrew of such speeches.\\n\\nKnesset meetings are regularly attended by government ministers and the prime minister, who is by law a member of the Knesset.\\n\\nKnesset debates cover a variety of topics, including security, economics, and social issues. These debates also cover a variety of types of deliberation, among them are legislation, motions for the agenda, parliamentary questions for government Ministers, and motions of no-confidence in the government.\\n\\n### 3. Corpus Creation\\n\\n#### 3.1. Knesset Protocols\\n\\n#### 3.1.1. Preprocessing\\n\\nThe Knesset Plenary Records (\u201cDivrei Haknesset\u201d) is a verbatim record of the debates held in the Knesset Plenary Chamber. The Knesset regulations direct that the protocol includes discussions above the stand or in designated places in the plenary hall, as well as interjections. We processed the digital versions of Knesset plenary protocols publicly available as DOC and DOCX files.\\n\\nSpeeches from the Knesset protocols were extracted as far as the 13th Knesset, sworn in on July 13th, 1992. Extraction started at that point in time since DOC/DOCX from prior Knessets were digitized via OCR and could not be parsed reliably given the amount of OCR errors. DOCX files were parsed using the `python-docx` module, while DOC files were converted to DOCX with Microsoft Word, using the `win32com` python client.\\n\\nAn iterative pipeline has been developed to identify and extract topics, speaker names and speech texts utilizing style tags, stylistic cues present in the documents and regular expressions. This procedure has been tailored to account for changes over time in Knesset protocol formats, resulting in two separate pipelines for processing the data.\\n\\n**Pipeline A.** This pipeline has been designed for newer formats of the protocol containing style tags produced by various document-generating systems throughout the years. These style tags were used to identify different parts of each protocol. However, the tags and their names vary considerably throughout the years. In order to capture these changes we have conducted an iterative process based on the following steps: (1) Extracting information based on an initial list of style tags, (2) Human validation of a sample of raw protocol text and extracted information from different Knessets to identify misidentification, and (3) updating list of style tags and regular expressions. Steps 1-3 were repeated until no faults were found and extracted information matched raw protocols.\\n\\n**Pipeline B.** This pipeline was developed for older formats in which no style tags were used. In their absence, extraction in these cases was based on stylistic cues. As with style tags in the newer format, stylistic cues have changed throughout the years in these older files. In order to capture these changes we have conducted an iterative process based on the following steps: (1) Extracting information based on an initial list of stylistic cues present in the documents and regular expressions, (2) Human validation of sample of text from different Knessets to identify misidentification, and (3) updating processing of stylistic cues and regular expressions. Steps 1-3 were repeated until no faults were found and extracted information matched raw protocols.\\n\\n#### 3.1.2. Metadata\\n\\nSpeaker names extracted from the protocols were matched to a metadata file containing longitudinal data on MKs, including time of service as MKs in each Knesset and each party (in case of changes in party affiliation), full name, gender, date and birth and place of birth. Names of speakers were matched to canonical names from the metadata file via exact matching when possible, or otherwise using fuzzy string matching with human validation. Efforts were made so that the extracted text and metadata match the plenary protocols as closely as possible. There was no attempt to find and fix mistakes or issues with the plenary documents themselves, except for a handful of systematic issues (e.g., the '=' character appearing instead of '-' in older protocol files).\"}"}

We applied for, and were granted, an Academic Research Access to the Twitter API v2, and utilized it to download all the posts made by these accounts, from the beginning of their activity on Twitter (as far back as 2008). The extraction was carried out using the tweepy python module. Twitter post collection concluded on 27.3.2023, and the corpus reflects the availability of posts on that date. Twitter handles were manually associated with identifiers from the metadata file.\\n\\nThe corpus is divided into four main sections: Knesset Sessions, Twitter Posts, Office Sessions and Linguistic Analyses. Here, we provide a detailed description for each of the sections.\\n\\n### 4.1. Knesset Sessions\\nThis section contains the utterances of the MKs on the Knesset floor, in the order in which they appeared in the consecutive plenary protocol files. The utterances vary in length and may contain anything from a few words to a complete speech. Interruptions and interjections are preserved as they appear in the protocols. In total, this section contains approximately 4.5M individual utterances. The data is organized in CSV format, where each row represents a single utterance, and contains the following fields:\\n\\n- **text**: The text of the utterance.\\n- **uuid**: A unique text identifier used for associating the text with separately provided morphological analysis.\\n- **knesset**: Knesset term.\\n- **session_number**: Session number in current Knesset term.\\n- **date**: Date of session.\\n- **person_id**: Numeric identifier for speaker. Numeric identifiers are only assigned to MKs. 3% of speakers lack an identifier in cases of non-MK politicians (e.g. president, non-MK ministers), administrative Knesset workers or guests, or if the matching MK could not be determined. Speakers are assigned an identifier if they were MKs in the time period of the corpus, even if they are not MKs at the time the utterance is made (e.g. presidents that were previously MKs).\\n- **canonical_name**: The canonical name (first name and surname) of the speaker. Only present for MKs for which an identifier can be determined.\\n- **name**: The name of the speaker as extracted from the protocol.\\n- **chair**: Indicator for whether or not the speaker was the chair of session.\\n- **topic**: Topic of discussion or agenda item.\\n- **topic_extra**: Additional information on the topic (e.g. subtitle, legislation proposal number).\\n- **qa**: Indicator for whether or not the utterance is part of a Questions and Answers session.\\n- **query**: The written query to which utterance is a an oral response.\\n- **only_read**: Indicator for whether or not the utterance was a Q&A response that was read and not delivered by the answerer orally.\\n\\nTable 1 displays statistics for the Knesset Sessions section of the corpus, organized by Knesset terms.\\n\\n### 4.2. Twitter Posts\\nThis section contains the tweets posted by the MKs, in chronological order. In total, it contains approximately 821K tweets. The data is organized in a CSV format, where each row represents a single tweet and contains the following fields:\\n\\n- **text**: The text of the tweet.\\n- **uuid**: A unique text identifier used for associating the text with separately provided morphological analysis.\\n- **tweet_id**: Twitter's unique tweet identifier.\\n- **date**: Date of the tweet.\\n- **knesset**: The Knesset term corresponding to the date of the tweet.\\n- **person_id**: Numeric identifier for the tweet poster. All rows have an identifier since only posts by MKs were collected. However, note that the poster was not necessarily serving as an MK at the time of posting.\\n- **user_id**: Twitter user ID number.\\n- **username**: Twitter handle name.\"}"}

Linguistic Analyses\\nThis section contains additional analyses performed on the texts in the Knesset Sessions and Twitter Data sections. The texts were processed using the Stanza morphological analysis pipeline (Qi et al., 2020). Sentiment labels were added using the HeBERT Hebrew sentiment model (Chriqui and Yahav, 2022). The data is organized in JSON format, where the keys are the 'uuid' identifiers for individual texts in the Knesset Sessions and Twitter Posts sections. The values include:\\n\\n\u2022 sentences. The text segmented into a list of sentences.\\n\u2022 tokens. A list of tokens for each sentence. Each token is a dictionary containing Stanza's morphological outputs:\\n  \u2013 id.

A list of grammatical features, e.g. gender, Binyan, Number, Person, Tense and Voice.\\n  \u2013 misc. A list of starting character position and ending character position for the tokens in the text.\\n\u2022 sentiment. A list of sentiment labels for each sentence (negative/positive/neutral).\\n\\nIt is important to note that while the corpus is overwhelmingly in the Hebrew language, occasional texts may partially or fully consist of tokens in English, Arabic, Amharic or other languages.\\n\\n5. Data Analysis\\nThe fact that the textual data was taken from two different sources \u2013 Knesset sessions and Twitter posts \u2013 as well as its augmentation with rich and diverse metadata, allows for a wide variety of possible interesting analyses. In this section, we describe several such analyses and discuss their results.\\n\\n5.1. Platform (Knesset vs. Twitter)\\nTable 3 shows the distribution of part-of-speech tags in the Knesset and Twitter sections. Although there are no drastic differences, it is interesting to note those which do exist between the sources. For example, Knesset utterances contain more nouns, pointing to a more prominent use of first-person expressions. Twitter posts, on the other hand, contain more proper nouns, indicating a more person-focused discourse.\\n\\nIn order to approximate the lexical diversity across the two different platforms, we use the common Type/Token Ratio (TTR) measure (Chotlos, 1944), calculated as $TTR = \\\\frac{T_{\\\\text{types}}}{T_{\\\\text{tokens}}}$, where $T_{\\\\text{types}}$ is the number of unique tokens and $T_{\\\\text{tokens}}$ is the total number of tokens. A higher TTR is considered to indicate higher lexical diversity. Figure 3 shows the histograms of the TTR (per MK) for the Knesset and Twitter sections. The results indicate that Twitter posts are generally more lexically diverse ($TTR = 0.22$) than Knesset sessions ($TTR = 0.13$).\\n\\nFigure 4 shows the histogram of speaker sentiment scores in Knesset floor speeches and Twitter posts.

For each MK, we aggregated the sentence-level sentiment labels to calculate a sentiment score $S = p - n$, where $p$ is the count of positive sentences and $n$ the count of negative sentences. As can be seen, while speech on both platforms is overwhelmingly negative, Twitter speech ($S = -0.32$) is more positive than speech on the Knesset floor ($S = -0.54$).\\n\\n5.2. Gender\\n\\nFigure 1 displays the yearly percentage of tokens produced by women and by men in the Knesset. It is evident that while women's speech as measured in tokens remains a minority, there is a significant increase in the share of tokens spoken by women across time.\\n\\nSimilarly, Figure 2 shows the yearly percentage of tokens produced by women and by men on Twitter. The results show that women have generated a significantly larger share of Twitter tokens (compared to Knesset utterances), albeit less than 50%. This share has actually decreased from 2016 onwards.\\n\\nFigure 5 displays the yearly TTR by gender for the Knesset section, and Figure 7 displays the yearly TTR by gender for the Twitter section.

{"id": "lrec-2024-main-819", "page_num": 8, "content": "{\"primary_language\":\"en\",\"is_rotation_valid\":true,\"rotation_correction\":0,\"is_table\":false,\"is_diagram\":false,\"natural_text\":\"In Knesset utterances, the first 20 years show a significant difference in sentiment, whereas the latter 10 years show convergence to a similar sentiment. During these same 10 years, however, a significant difference remains evident between men and women in Twitter posts.\\n\\nFinally, we examine which words most distinctly characterize female and male MKs on each of the platforms. We do so by following Monroe et al. (2008) in calculating the weighted log odds for each token in the text. Table 4 shows the top 20 distinctive lemmatized tokens for women and men in Knesset utterances, and Table 5 reports the same for Twitter posts. Both tables show the leading distinctive tokens after removal of non-informative tokens. In order to accommodate non-Hebrew readers, each lemma has also been translated into English.\\n\\nWe can make several interesting observations based on these two tables. Observing the first table, female Knesset discourse seems to be centered around family, gender and social issues (domestic violence, environmental problems), whereas male Knesset discourse is more focused on issues of security, economics and the Jewish religion (the latter is probably due to the fact that religious orthodox factions consist solely of male MKs). Female utterance vocabulary also exhibits more attention to emotions compared to their male counterparts.\\n\\nThe second table provides an interesting comparison as well. On Twitter, both genders use terms that seem to elicit emotional responses. However, female MKs tend to use terms that are more associated with individual and family-related environments, as well as words and emojis that describe emotional states. Male MKs, on the other hand, tend to appeal more to the \\\"collective\\\" and partisan-political environments, using terms related to security and national identity. Another prominent difference is in the use of proper nouns \u2013 male posters tend to utilize names much more than female posters (7 out of 20 terms for men, compared to only one out of 20 terms for women).\\n\\nIn general, we can observe that Twitter speech appears to be more personalized and emotional, while Knesset floor utterances appear to be more formalistic and procedural. Unsurprisingly, Twitter speech is distinguished by the use of emojis (albeit mostly by female posters).\\n\\n6. Conclusion\\n\\nWe present IsraParlTweet, a new corpus of Knesset discussions (between the years 1992-2023) and Twitter posts (between the years 2008-2023) in the Hebrew language, linked by speaker and to additional metadata. In addition to raw text, the corpus contains rich meta-data in the form of speaker & session details, as well as morphological and sentiment tagging. The parallel nature of the corpus, along with the rich meta-data, provide a unique opportunity to study both the formal (Knesset) and the informal (Twitter) discourse in the Israeli political arena and explore the connections and interactions.\"}"}

We demonstrate this potential by utilizing a single speaker attribute \u2013 gender \u2013 to perform extensive statistical analyses which yield intriguing results and observations. IsraParlTweet is one of the largest resources in spoken Hebrew, and the first to make the Knesset plenum debate and MKs social media messages accessible to researchers. It is our hope that this resource will facilitate new and exciting studies in a variety of academic research fields.\\n\\n7.
