While maintaining competitive results on PSNR/SSIM, we notice our SSIM score could be less satisfactory in some cases. Our exploration reveals SSIM's inclination to label high-frequency artifacts as \\\"sharpness\\\" and its tendency to penalize blurriness more. In Table 2 (right), the SSIM score of the P2L output is much better than ours regardless of the artifacts. Consequently, the following discussion primarily emphasizes LPIPS.\\n\\nInversion Efficiency: Table 2 (left) compares solver efficiency amongst SoTA methods. LDM-based solvers generate 512\u21e5512 images whereas PDMs produce 256\u21e5256. We downscale the LDM runtime by 4X for a fair comparison with PDMs. P2L [10] runtime is estimated based on its pseudo-code due to the unavailability of source code. Consequently, STSL achieves desired results in fewer diffusion steps (T = 50) compared to PSLD [43] and P2L [10] (T = 1000). This computational gain allows extra budget for local iterative gradient updates (K = 5) using our surrogate loss. In addition, STSL realizes a notable 4X improvement in the number of NFEs compared to PSLD [43], and 8X over P2L [10]. Since NFE is the most expensive component in posterior sampling (\u00a73.1), less NFEs translate to practical advantages in runtime efficiency.\\n\\n5.2. Ablation Study\\nBias Analysis: STSL mitigates bias in the first-order Tweedie estimator by employing stochastic averaging steps with the surrogate loss \\\\( L(y, Z_t) \\\\) (\u00a73.2) and an alternative reverse process (3) initialized at \\\\( Z_0 \\\\sim p_{T}(Z_0 | E(A^T y)) \\\\). By eliminating Hutchinson's trace estimator (\u2318 = 0) and using a single-step gradient update with \\\\( L(y, Z_t) \\\\), we derive the biased estimator STSL-biased. The disparity between STSL-biased and PSLD [43] lies in their initialization: the former begins with \\\\( Z_0 \\\\) drawn from \\\\( p_{T}(Z_0 | E(A^T y)) \\\\), while the latter from \\\\( \\\\ddot{\\\\varepsilon}d \\\\). Evaluating on 100 random images in FFHQ, Table 3 shows the advantages of our improved initialization and stochastic averaging steps over PSLD [43].\\n\\nComponent Analysis: We study the significance of each component in STSL using 50 random samples from the COCO [30] dataset.

Results on Image Editing\\nQualitative Study: STSL seamlessly extends to editing corrupted image. As shown in Figure 3, both NTI [35] and commercial software exhibit lower editing quality for real images with or without corruption. NTI [35] struggles to generate quality images with corruptions. The commercial software demands user-selected regions for editing. In contrast, STSL-CAT accurately localizes the edits without user intervention, and preserves the integrity of the entire image. For example, in NTI [35], replacing the car with a bicycle affects the surrounding house, and transforming the house to a supermarket changes the SUV into a sedan.\\n\\nQuantitative Study: Table 4(f) shows a quantitative analysis of 100 randomly selected dog images from ImageNet for \u201ca dog\u201d to \u201ca cat\u201d editing.

The CLIP accuracy [18] remains similar, because it doesn\u2019t measure content preservation but only the matching between the output and the target prompt. In corrupted image editing (the last two columns), our end-to-end STSL-CAT pipeline demonstrates effectiveness by surpassing NTI [35] with a notable relative improvement of 32% in CLIP accuracy.\\n\\n6. Conclusion\\nWe introduced STSL, a novel posterior sampler that combines the efficiency of the first-order Tweedie with a tractable second-order approximation in a new reverse process. Our theoretical results show that our surrogate loss, requiring only an estimate of the trace of the Hessian, establishes a lower bound for the second-order approximation. STSL achieves 4X and 8X reduction in neural function evaluations compared to SoTA solvers PSLD [43] and P2L [10], respectively, while enhancing sampling quality across various inversion tasks. STSL extends to text-guided image editing, surpassing NTI [35] in handling corrupted images. To our best knowledge, this marks the first efficient second-order approximation for solving inverse problems using latent diffusion and image editing with corruption.\\n\\nAcknowledgements: This research is supported by NSF Grant 2019844, a Google research collaboration award, and the UT Austin Machine Learning Lab.

Existing methods often rely on Tweedie's first-order moments that tend to induce biased results\\\\(^{[32]}\\\\). Second-order approximations are computationally prohibitive, making standard reverse diffusion processes intractable for posterior sampling. We present Second-order Tweedie sampler from Surrogate Loss (STSL), a novel sampler offering efficiency comparable to first-order Tweedie while enabling tractable reverse processes using second-order approximation. Theoretical results reveal that our approach establishes a lower bound through a surrogate loss and enables a tractable reverse process using the trace of the Hessian with only \\\\(O(1)\\\\) compute. We show STSL outperforms SoTA solvers PSLD\\\\(^{[43]}\\\\) and P2L\\\\(^{[10]}\\\\) by reducing neural function evaluations by 4X and 8X, respectively, while enhancing sampling quality on FFHQ, ImageNet, and COCO benchmarks. Moreover, STSL extends to text-guided image editing, effectively mitigating residual distortions in corrupted images. To our best knowledge, this is the first work to offer an efficient second-order approximation for solving inverse problems using latent diffusion, which further enables editing real-world images with corruptions.\\n\\n1. Introduction\\n\\nThis paper focuses on solving inverse problems using pre-trained latent diffusion models. The goal of linear inverse problem solvers is to find an image \\\\(x \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^d\\\\) that satisfies\\n\\n\\\\[ y = Ax + n, \\\\quad n \\\\sim \\\\mathcal{N}(0, \\\\Sigma), \\\\]\\n\\nwhere \\\\(A \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^{k \\\\times d}\\\\) is a known measurement operator and \\\\(y \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^k\\\\) is a noisy observation with unknown \\\\(\\\\Sigma\\\\). This gives rise to a sampling challenge, where the objective is to sample the posterior \\\\(p(X | Y = y)\\\\). Diffusion models are gaining popularity as priors \\\\((p_t(X_t))\\\\) for solving inverse problems\\\\(^{[7,8,10,43,49]}\\\\). However, the likelihood term \\\\((p_t(y | X_t))\\\\) is only available for time \\\\(t = 0\\\\), but not for \\\\(t > 0\\\\), making posterior sampling inconsistent with the Bayesian posterior. One way to address this issue is training a noise conditional likelihood model, yet this is limited by training costs and the need for re-training when the measurement operator \\\\(A\\\\) changes\\\\(^{[13]}\\\\). State-of-the-art methods, such as PSLD\\\\(^{[43]}\\\\) and P2L\\\\(^{[10]}\\\\), resort to alternatives for computing \\\\(p_t(y | X_t)\\\\). Among these methods,\"}"}

STSL leverages Tweedie's second-order approximation using Tweedie's formula with first-order moments to address the bias and improve the results by introducing a new surrogate loss function to enable a tractable reverse diffusion process via efficient second-order approximation. Our results demonstrate superior performance in solving inverse problems with Tweedie's second-order approximation.\\n\\nWe consider image editing from corrupted images. Using our STSL sampler, we can incorporate generative models for specific tasks. Our method achieves faithful reconstruction with fewer steps compared to existing approaches, and requires a smaller number of diffusion steps for satisfactory reconstruction. In contrast, our framework surpasses the state-of-the-art (SoTA) NTI \\\\([\\\\mathcal{L}]\\\\) and Tweedie Attention-Tuning (CAT) methods. Our results show that STSL can handle corruptions in image editing pipelines, offering a more practical and efficient approach.

We introduce a new framework for high-fidelity image editing from corrupted images.\\n2. We present an efficient second-order approximation using Tweedie's formula to mitigate the bias incurred in the surrogates.\\n3. We demonstrate that STSL is significantly more robust than existing methods, solving linear inverse problems in just 50 steps and requiring only estimates of the score and the drift of the reverse process via efficient second-order approximation. Our method is widely used in SoTA solvers due to its simplicity and efficiency, but there are still significant limitations and sub-optimal performance due to biases in reconstruction.\\n\\nIn terms of neural function evaluations over the posterior distribution \\\\(p\\\\), this translates into a 4X and 8X improvement. This improvement is substantial over the state-of-the-art solvers in terms of neural function evaluations over the posterior distribution. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate superior performance of our method in tackling inverse problems (such as image denoising, inpainting, super-resolution, Gaussian deblurring, and motion deblurring) on standard benchmarks: FFHQ, ImageNet, and COCO. We show that STSL solves linear inverse problems in just 1000 steps. This translates into a 4X and 8X improvement in the number of steps required for satisfactory reconstruction.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first framework that can handle corruptions in image editing pipelines in a two-stage design: first restore the image using our inverse problem solver in just 50 steps, and then guide the reverse process in text-based editing using Cross-Attention Tuning (CAT) to achieve high-fidelity text-guided image editing.\\n\\nIn this two-stage design, our approach initially performs restoration using the framework, and then uses the generated latent images to guide the reverse process in text-based editing using CAT. This results in high-fidelity text-guided image editing in real-world environments with corruptions.

In contrast, our framework surpasses the best of our knowledge, this is the first framework that can handle corruptions in image editing pipelines in just 50 steps, and then guide the reverse process in text-based editing using CAT. This results in high-fidelity text-guided image editing in real-world environments with corruptions. To address this, we repurpose STSL as a more effective alternative because it better approximates the posterior distribution and can be efficiently computed through random projection. As a result, it remains relatively unexplored to solve inverse problems with Tweedie's second-order approximation using Tweedie's formula.
