Make sure to put the answer (and only answer) inside \\\\boxed{}.\\n\\nQuestion:\\nMissy had a giant piggy bank in her bedroom. Every day she would search the house for change to put in her bank. After 4 years, the bank was opened and it contained $450 in change. If the second, third, and fourth-year she doubled the amount of money she put in the bank from the amount she had put in the previous year, how much money, in dollars, did she put in the bank the first year?\\n\\nMy solution:\\nMissy started with some amount of money in the first year. She was then doubling the amount of money every year for 4 years and ended up with $450.\\n\\nLet's write down an equation for this problem and solve it using sympy.\\n\\n```python\\nfrom sympy import solve, symbols\\n\\nfirst_year_money = symbols('first_year_money')\\nsecond_year_money = 2 * first_year_money\\nthird_year_money = 2 * second_year_money\\nfourth_year_money = 2 * third_year_money\\n\\n# Solve for first year money given that the combined saving is 450\\nresult = solve(first_year_money + second_year_money + third_year_money + fourth_year_money - 450, first_year_money)[0]\\nresult\\n```\\n\\nThus Missy put \\\\boxed{30} dollars in the bank the first year.\\n\\nQuestion:\\nPete has to take a 10-minute walk down to the train station and then board a 1hr 20-minute train to LA. When should he leave if he cannot get to LA later than 0900 hours? (24-hr time)\\n\\nMy solution:\\nSince Pete needs to take a 10 minutes walk and then a 1 hour 20 minutes train ride, he will spend a total of 1 hour and 30 minutes. This means that he needs to leave 1 hour and 30 minutes earlier than 09:00 hours.\\n\\nSubtracting 1 hour and 30 minutes from 09:00 hours we get \\\\boxed{07:30} hours.\\n\\nQuestion:\\nMark deposited $88 in a bank. Bryan deposited $40 less than five times as much as Mark. How much did Bryan deposit in the bank?\\n\\nMy solution:\\nLet's solve this problem using Python code.\\n\\n```python\\nmark_deposit = 88\\nfive_times_mark_deposit = 5 * mark_deposit\\n\\nBryan_deposit = five_times_mark_deposit - 40\\nBryan_deposit\\n```\\n\\nBryan deposited $\\\\boxed{330}$ in the bank.\"}"}

Current large-scale math instruction tuning datasets such as MetaMathQA [1] and MAmmoTH [2] are constructed using outputs from closed-source LLMs with commercially restrictive licenses. A key reason limiting the use of open-source LLMs in these data generation pipelines has been the wide gap between the mathematical skills of the best closed-source LLMs, such as GPT-4, and the best open-source LLMs. Building on our proposed prompting novelty, the recent progress in open-source LLMs, and some brute-force scaling, we construct OpenMathInstruct-1, a high-quality math instruction tuning dataset with 1.8M problem-solution pairs.

The statistics for the training set coverage of GPT-4 are from [8] and MATH [13]. We use the metric training set coverage (TSC) to compare the models, where TSC measures the number of training problems for which any of the generated solutions leads to the ground truth answer (pass@k). Figure 1 shows the training set coverage (TSC) of the Mixtral model as a function of the number of sampled solutions. For the relatively easier GSM8K benchmark, the Mixtral model\u2019s coverage catches up to GPT-4\u2019s with almost 8x the number of solution samples. For the challenging MATH benchmark, even with 12x the number of solutions, the Mixtral model still has a lower TSC than GPT-4. This gap in the training set coverage reflects the distillation data quality and, hence, the quality of the final fine-tuned model. This explains the preference for GPT-4 in the current distillation pipelines for mathematical reasoning.\\n\\nBridging the coverage gap between GPT-4 and Open-source LLMs: We limit our investigation of open-source LLMs for synthesizing solutions to the Mixtral-base model due to (a) its strong performance on mathematical reasoning tasks compared to other open-source LLMs, and (b) its permissive license.\\n\\nAs a first attempt, we use a brute-force approach of sampling several solutions per problem. However, this approach only scales logarithmically, limiting its effectiveness (Figure 1). Next, we explore the approach of targeted solution generation, where we write few-shot prompts focused on specific sections of the training data. Concretely, we write few-shot prompts for each mathematics subject in the MATH dataset and merge the synthesized solutions. The motivation is that these subject-specific few-shot prompts could better target the latent mathematical capabilities of these general-purpose LLMs. Unfortunately, we only find a marginal gain in TSC with this approach (Section 2.2.2). Finally, we utilize the fact that reference text solutions accompany mathematical benchmarks such as MATH and GSM8K. These reference solutions can aid the synthesis of code-interpreter style solutions. We show that using these reference solutions in our few-shot prompt with a slight modification substantially increases the coverage and, consequently, the performance of the fine-tuned model (Section 2.2.3 and 4.1.2).\\n\\nOur solution synthesis experiments result in OpenMathInstruct-1, a collection of 1.8M problem-solution pairs. OpenMathInstruct-1 has a training set coverage of 93% for MATH and 99.9% for GSM8K. Table 1 shows that compared to previous mathematical reasoning fine-tuning datasets, OpenMathInstruct-1 is at least four times bigger, and, even more importantly, it is permissively licensed, allowing unrestricted usage by future work. To illustrate the quality of OpenMathInstruct-1, we train and release a range of models based on Mistral-7B [14], Llama 2 [15], and CodeLlama [16]. In particular, the CodeLlama-70B model fine-tuned on a subset of OpenMathInstruct-1, referred to as OpenMath-CodeLlama-70B, achieves a score of 84.6% on GSM8K and 50.7% on MATH. These scores are competitive with the current best GPT-distilled models. Finally, to support the open-source efforts in this direction, we have publicly released all our fine-tuned models, code, and the OpenMathInstruct-1 dataset, along with a further 6.6M incorrect sampled solutions under a commercially permissive license.  \\n\\n3 https://mistral.ai/news/mixtral-of-experts/  \\n\\n4 The incorrect solution trajectories can be used to train verifier models [12, 17, 18].\"}"}

Recent work has also attempted augmenting training set problems [1, 2], but we limit our exploration to solution synthesis for existing problems in the benchmark.\\n\\n5 Solution Format.\\n\\nWe use the code-interpreter format for the synthesized solutions (see Figure 5 in Appendix for a sample solution). The code-interpreter format interweaves natural language reasoning with Python code blocks. It thus combines the computation precision of coding environments with the expressiveness of natural language reasoning, which is particularly suitable for mathematical reasoning tasks [8, 23]. To demarcate the start and end of a code block, we use the strings \u27e8llm-code\u27e9 and \u27e8/llm-code\u27e9. A code block is followed by its execution block, which is demarcated by \u27e8llm-code-output\u27e9 and \u27e8/llm-code-output\u27e9. During inference, the model invokes the Python interpreter to run the preceding code block after generating \u27e8/llm-code\u27e9, appends the execution result in between the \u27e8llm-code-output\u27e9 separators, and resumes the autoregressive model inference.\\n\\n6 Approach.\\n\\nWe use few-shot prompting to synthesize solutions for the training sets of GSM8K and MATH. Formally, the prompt has the form: $I(q_1, c_1), \\\\ldots, (q_K, c_K) q'$ where $I$ represents a text-based instruction for the task, $\\\\{q_1, \\\\ldots, q_K\\\\}$ represent $K$ problems representative of the dataset, $\\\\{c_1, \\\\ldots, c_K\\\\}$ represent their respective solutions in the code-interpreter format, and $q'$ represents a question from the training set. Given this prompt, the base LLM generates a candidate solution $c'$ for the question $q'$. If $c'$ leads to the correct answer for the question $q'$, we add the pair $(q', c')$ to our fine-tuning set. For all our experiments, we choose $K = 5$, and the representative problems are chosen from the training set of the corresponding benchmark. In the instruction $I$, we instruct the model to output the answer inside the $\\\\boxed{}$ block. The complete instruction is in Table 13 in Appendix B.4.\\n\\n7 Sampling Details.\\n\\nWe sample solutions with temperature=1.0 and top_p=0.95. We use the following constraints in our generation pipeline: (a) the total number of input-output tokens is limited to 4096, (b) a maximum of 512 new tokens after each code block, (c) a maximum of 3 code blocks, and (d) the generation halts after any code execution error. We use the TensorRT-LLM toolkit.\\n\\n5 Both GSM8K and MATH have these text solutions.\\n\\n6 During training, we don\u2019t mask the code execution output surrounded by \u27e8llm-code-output\u27e9 separators.\\n\\n7 https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT-LLM\"}"}

A key ingredient of this pipeline is the few-shot prompt examples. We next describe the different prompting strategies explored in this work.\\n\\n2.2.1 Default\\n\\nWe choose five representative examples of GSM8K and MATH to create the few-shot prompt for the respective datasets. For GSM8K, we use a mix of problems that require vanilla Python code and problems that are best solved using Python's sympy library. For MATH, we compose a 5-shot prompt with examples from different subjects. To reflect this diversity of reasoning paths required for MATH, we choose a mix of problems that require code-based solutions, text-based solutions, and a combination of both. The prompts used for the two datasets are presented in Appendix B.6.\\n\\nFor GSM8K, we sample 128 solutions per training problem, which gets a training set coverage of 99.1%. For MATH, we sample 224 solutions per training problem, which only achieves a training set coverage of 80.1%. This difference in coverage reflects the difficulty of the MATH benchmark compared to GSM8K, which has been noted in previous work as well [8, 9].\\n\\n2.2.2 Subject-specific Prompting (Subj)\\n\\nCould the diversity of mathematical topics in MATH be a reason for the low training set coverage with a single 5-shot prompt?\\n\\nTo answer this question, we create subject-specific prompts for the seven subjects in the MATH benchmark, namely algebra, geometry, intermediate algebra, number theory, prealgebra, precalculus, and probability (See Table 11 in the appendix for the subject-wise split of MATH training data). The MATH benchmark also labels problems by their hardness level, with levels ranging from 1 to 5, where level 5 is the hardest. For creating subject-specific 5-shot prompts, we choose one example from each level for a given subject. For each of the seven prompts, we sample 32 solutions per problem and combine the data generated with all the prompts, which is equivalent to 32 x 7 = 224 solutions per problem. However, even with this fine-grained prompting, we only achieve a negligible gain in the training set coverage, though the total number of correct solutions increases by 14K (177K \u2192 191K, see Table 2).\\n\\nCombining this fine-tuning dataset with the earlier single default prompt dataset yields a training coverage of 85.1% for MATH, a boost of 5% absolute. However, achieving this coverage required sampling almost 450 solutions per problem (224 + 224 = 448).\\n\\nCan we make the solution generation pipeline more efficient?\\n\\n2.2.3 Masked Text Solution Prompting (Mask-Text)\\n\\nGSM8K and MATH benchmarks come with reference text solutions. Using these text solutions can, in theory, reduce the problem of code-interpreter solution generation to a translation problem from text to code. We initially experimented by prompting the LLM with:\\n\\n\\\\[\\nI(q_1, t_1, c_1), \\\\ldots, (q_K, t_K, c_K)q', t', c'\\n\\\\]\"}"}

For 3 magazines, Lynne spent 3 x 4 = $12. In total, Lynne spent 63 + 12 = $75.\\n\\nFigure 2: A sample masked solution from GSM8K training set. The masked text solution only masks the intermediate computations, such as 9 \u2192 M and 63 \u2192 N, and doesn't mask the amounts introduced in the question, such as 7, 2, and $4.\\n\\nwhere t_i's represent the text solution of representative problem q_i's and t'_i represents the text solution of the problem q'_i. Using the text solution in the prompt leads to a considerable increase in training set coverage. However, our manual analysis revealed that many solutions were shortcuts. E.g., trivial solutions such as print(ANSWER) or The answer is ANSWER where the ANSWER is copied from the text solution t'_i in the prompt. Our attempts to filter out these trivial solutions proved challenging as there are many creative ways in which the generated solutions were cheating (see Figure 11 in Appendix).\\n\\nTo deter the possibility of such shortcuts solutions where the results of intermediate computations or the final answer from the text solution are copied, we propose prompting with a masked text solution. Such solutions have all numbers in intermediate computations replaced with symbols. A sample masked text solution is shown in Figure 2. These masked text solutions are generated using few-shot prompting as follows:\\n\\nI mask (q_1, t_1, t_mask_1), \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7, (q_K, t_K, t_mask_K) q'_1, t'_1\\n\\nwhere I mask represents the instruction for the solution masking task, and \\\\{t_mask_1, \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7, t_mask_K\\\\} represent masked text solutions corresponding to \\\\{t_1, \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7, t_K\\\\}.\\n\\nTable 2 summarizes the statistics of the solutions dataset generated via different prompts. The OpenMathInstruct-1 dataset is obtained by merging and deduplicating the problem-solution pairs resulting from the above-described prompt strategies. OpenMathInstruct-1 consists of 787K unique solutions for 6978 problems (out of 7500) in MATH and 1.04M unique solutions for 7469 problems (out of 7473) in GSM8K. To get to this final dataset, we also perform a few post-processing steps, which are described next.\\n\\n2.3 Post-processing\\n\\nThe generated solutions can sometimes be syntactically noisy even if they lead to the right answer. We fix or remove the following solutions:\\n\\n- Remove solutions with multiple \\\\boxed{} blocks.\\n- Remove solutions with the \\\\langle llm-code \\\\rangle string but not the \\\\langle /llm-code \\\\rangle string.\\n- Remove text beyond the solution line with the answer, i.e., the \\\\boxed{} block. See Figure 12 in the Appendix for an example solution where we perform trimming.\\n\\nWhile these post-processing steps can fix some of the syntactic errors, filtering semantically noisy, i.e., solutions that get to the right answer with flawed reasoning [12], is a much harder problem and beyond the scope of this work. Anecdotally, we find such solutions to be rare in our corpus. See Figure 13 in the Appendix for a sample semantically noisy solution.\"}"}

These solutions can have different formats (code vs. text), and problems can have very different numbers of solutions in the dataset. Careful data selection allows for reduced training times and can also benefit performance. We detail the data selection strategies explored in this work.\\n\\n2.4.1 Fair vs. Naive Downsampling\\n\\nFor a dataset like MATH, where problems have divergent difficulty levels, our solution generation strategy leads to a corpus where easier problems have a lot of solutions and harder problems have very few solutions (see Appendix A.2 for a detailed discussion on solution count). A naive strategy for downsampling treats every instance, i.e., problem-solution pair, as an equal. This problem-agnostic sampling perpetuates the imbalance of the original corpus, as seen in Figure 3(a). We propose a fair sampling alternate in which we iterate over all the problems round-robin and sample without replacement from the remaining solutions for each problem. This problem-dependent sampling ensures a more balanced representation of each problem in the downsampled dataset (see Figure 3(b)). Experimental results show that fair downsampling outperforms naive downsampling (Section 4.1.1).\\n\\n2.4.2 Code-Preferred Solutions\\n\\nThe code-interpreter format allows for mixing code and text, and also text-based solutions without any code blocks. For GSM8K, the proportion of text-based solutions is 2%, but for MATH, their representation is 35.1%. While natural language reasoning is more expressive, it lacks the precision of code-based solutions [24]. Suppose for a problem $q$ there are a total of $N_{\\\\text{total}}$ correct solutions in the corpus, out of which $N_{\\\\text{code}}$ represents the number of code-based solutions, and $N_{\\\\text{text}}$ represents the text-based solutions. We propose the following two code-preferential data selection strategies:\\n\\n- **Majority-Code**: If $N_{\\\\text{code}} > N_{\\\\text{text}}$, remove all the text-based solutions.\\n- **Any-Code**: If $N_{\\\\text{code}} > 0$, remove all the text-based solutions.\\n\\nAblation experiments over the MATH subset of OpenMathInstruct-1 show the benefit of code-preferential data selection (Section 4.1.4).\\n\\n3 Experimental Setup\\n\\n3.1 Training Details\\n\\nFor all our experiments, including ablations, models of size 34B or smaller are trained for four epochs.

We fine-tune the base model on a 128K downsampled subset to control for data size.\\n\\nDefault vs Subject-Specific Prompting.\\n\\nIn section 2.2.2, we motivated using subject-specific prompts, which ultimately didn't result in much training set coverage difference. But how are the solutions generated by the combination of subject-wise prompts different from a single default prompt? To answer this, we create a subset of 128K instances generated with the default prompt/subject-specific prompts. Table 7 compares the fine-tuning performance on these two splits on our MATH validation subset. While the model trained on the subject-specific subset underperforms the model trained on the default subset with greedy decoding, the trend is decisively reversed for self-consistency decoding with four samples. This suggests that the subset collected with subject-specific prompts has a higher diversity of solutions than the ones collected using a single prompt.\\n\\nCode-Preferential Subsets.\\n\\nIn this ablation, we determine the impact of code-preferential solution selection strategies proposed in Section 2.4.2. Table 8 shows that code-preferential solution strategies aid the greedy decoding performance. However, the reduction in solution diversity arguably results in a performance drop with self-consistency decoding (text-based solutions are about one-third of the original corpus). Based on these results and because Any-Code results in a smaller finetuning dataset (512K compared to 664K with Majority-Code), we chose to use the Any-Code subset.\\n\\n5 Analysis\\n\\nWe analyze the performance of the ablation model trained on 512K instances from Section 4.1.3. We limit the discussion to the MATH benchmark, where the model scores 41.6% on our validation subset.\\n\\nPerformance-split by Subjects and Levels.\\n\\nFigure 4 presents the performance split by subjects and levels on the MATH validation subset. Among subjects, we see that the model's worst performance is on geometry, which can be attributed to the lack of multi-modality in our base models [23]. We see a monotonic decrease in performance with the increase in hardness level which is to be expected [23]. The model scores 72.4% on Level 1 problems and only 16.3% on the hardest problems, i.e., Level 5.\\n\\nError Analysis.\\n\\nTable 9 shows that the model performs an absolute 13.3% better when using code for answering questions in comparison to when not using it. We find that some of the errors made by text-based solution could have been avoided by preferring code-based solution; see Figure 16 for a sample solution where the model makes an arithmetic calculation error. This analysis provides another support for our proposal and use of code-preferred solutions from Section 2.4.2.\\n\\nTable 10 presents the count of different error categories. For code-based solutions, we find that almost 74% of the errors in such solutions are due to reasoning errors, and the remaining 26% are attributable to execution-related issues. We present sample solutions from these error categories in Appendix B.3.\"}"}

A more direct approach of dataset-specific training does instruction fine-tuning on problem-solution pairs derived from math reasoning datasets. Our work falls in this latter category and bears similarity with recent work such as RFT [39], ToRA [8], MAmmoTH [2], MetaMath [1] and MathCoder [7]. We differ from the previous work along one factor or a combination of the following factors: (a) reliance on GPT-3.5/4, (b) solution format, and (c) use of ground truth text solution in synthesizing code-based solutions.\\n\\nKnowledge Distillation via Synthetic Data. Recent work exploring the use of targeted synthetic data generated by large foundation models for pre-training/instruction tuning smaller LLMs has led to tremendous progress in skills of these smaller LLMs [5, 6, 4, 40, 41, 42].\\n\\n7 Conclusion\\n\\nWe introduce OpenMathInstruct-1, a math instruction tuning dataset with 1.8M problem-solution pairs which is released with a commercially permissive license. Compared to previous work, the OpenMathInstruct-1 dataset is at least four times bigger. With our proposed prompting novelty of using masked text solutions and some brute-force scaling, we achieve training set coverage of 99.9% for the GSM8K benchmark and 93% for the challenging MATH benchmark. The quality of these synthesized solutions is illustrated by finetuning experiments, which show models achieving performance comparable to or better than their gpt-distilled counterparts. To support the open-source efforts in this direction, we publicly release all our fine-tuned models, code, and the OpenMathInstruct-1 along with a further 6.6M incorrect sampled solutions.\"}"}

In pursuit of this goal, we create a synthetic dataset, OpenMathInstruct-1, that our experiments show aids the performance on existing math benchmarks. Below, we list the key limitations of our work:\\n\\n- Our manual analysis reveals solutions that get the right answer but via flawed reasoning (Figure 13 in Appendix). Removing these semantically noisy solutions is beyond the scope of the current work. This means a lack of guarantee about the quality of our synthetically generated solutions.\\n- Improving performance on in-domain math benchmarks may not translate to performance gain on other related tasks. The drop in performance on GSM-Hard compared to GSM indicates that our models may not be robust to input perturbations, though, they are at par with previous work.\\n\\nWhile we don't foresee any material risk due to our work, using our imperfect dataset and models to perform tasks, such as evaluating student assignments or building a math tutor, carries risk.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\n[1] Longhui Yu, Weisen Jiang, Han Shi, Jincheng Yu, Zhengying Liu, Yu Zhang, James T Kwok, Zhenguo Li, Adrian Weller, and Weiyang Liu.

Claims\\n\\nQuestion: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the paper's contributions and scope?\\n\\nAnswer: [Yes]\\n\\nJustification: Our claims match our experimental results.\\n\\nGuidelines:\\n- The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims made in the paper.\\n- The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.\\n- The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.\\n- It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals are not attained by the paper.\\n\\n2. Limitations\\n\\nQuestion: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?\\n\\nAnswer: [Yes]\\n\\nGuidelines:\\n- The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.\\n- The authors are encouraged to create a separate \u201cLimitations\u201d section in their paper.\\n- The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings, model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the implications would be.\\n- The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.\\n- The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach. For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle technical jargon.\\n- The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms and how they scale with dataset size.\\n- If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to address problems of privacy and fairness.\\n- While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover limitations that aren't acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an important role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.\\n\\n3.

Experimental Result Reproducibility\\n\\nQuestion: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main experimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?\\n\\nAnswer: Yes\\n\\nJustification: We provide all the details to the best of our capacity. Some of the details have been shared in the supplementary material.\\n\\nGuidelines:\\n\\n\u2022 The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.\\n\\n\u2022 If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not.\\n\\n\u2022 If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken to make their results reproducible or verifiable.\\n\\n\u2022 Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways. For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general, releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.\\n\\n\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example\\n  (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm.\\n  (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully.\\n  (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).\\n  (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.\\n\\n5. Open access to data and code\\n\\nQuestion: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instructions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental material?\"}"}
