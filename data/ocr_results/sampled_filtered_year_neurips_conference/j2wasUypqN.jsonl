Given the user-designed learnable agent $A$ and optimizer $O$, our MetaBox framework firstly initializes the problem instance set (e.g., determines problem types, indexes file directories and loads data to construct problem instances according to the user-specified configuration $C_{\\\\text{train}}$). Then MetaBox iteratively performs training on each training instance until the max learning step is reached. For each instance, a Gym-style environment $\\\\text{Env}$ is constructed to merge $O$ and the problem instance together, so as to provide a unified interface. Agent $A$ then calls the train_episode() interface for interacting with $\\\\text{Env}$ and performing the actual training.\\n\\nAll the generated logs during training are managed by the $\\\\text{Logger}$ as depicted in Figure 1.\\n\\nWe now turn to the details of train_episode(). Given the variance among numerous learning approaches, such as RL and SL, the internal workflow of train_episode() necessitates implementation aligned with specific designs. Within MetaBox, we offer a range of examples through the implementation of various baselines, serving as guides for users who wish to develop their own interfaces. Meanwhile, we note that our baseline library also covers the implementations of prevalent RL algorithms like PPO and REINFORCE. In Algorithm 2, we showcase a straightforward example of the workflow for implementing RL training algorithms within train_episode(). Starting from the $\\\\text{Env}$ initialization, in each step, the agent $A$ provides $\\\\text{Env}$ the action according to the state, receives the next state, reward and other information, and uses them to update the policy. Within the $\\\\text{env.step()}$ interface, the action is translated into configurations which are then applied to the optimizer $O$. The optimizer then performs update rules to derive and evaluate new solutions. Following this, rewards and subsequent states are computed, with certain logging information being concurrently summarized.\\n\\nAs for the Tester shown in Algorithm 3, it first initializes the test problem set which is used to evaluate each algorithm in an algorithm set (including several baseline agents for comparison and the user's trained agent).

However, this field is hindered by the lack of a unified benchmark. To fill this gap, we introduce MetaBox, the first benchmark platform expressly tailored for developing and evaluating MetaBBO-RL methods. MetaBox offers a flexible algorithmic template that allows users to effortlessly implement their unique designs within the platform. Moreover, it provides a broad spectrum of over 300 problem instances, collected from synthetic to realistic scenarios, and an extensive library of 19 baseline methods, including both traditional black-box optimizers and recent MetaBBO-RL methods. Besides, MetaBox introduces three standardized performance metrics, enabling a more thorough assessment of the methods. In a bid to illustrate the utility of MetaBox for facilitating rigorous evaluation and in-depth analysis, we carry out a wide-ranging benchmarking study on existing MetaBBO-RL methods. Our MetaBox is open-source and accessible at: https://github.com/GMC-DRL/MetaBox.\\n\\n1 Introduction\\n\\nBlack Box Optimization (BBO) is a class of optimization problems featured by its objective function that is either unknown or too intricate to be mathematically formulated. It has a broad range of applications such as hyper-parameter tuning [1], neural architecture searching [2], and protein-docking [3]. Due to the black-box nature, the optimizer has no access to the mathematical expression, gradients, or any other structural information related to the problem.

The Bayesian Optimization (BO) [14, 15] is also commonly used. However, with limited knowledge of the problem, these optimizers lean on carefully hand-crafted designs to strike a balance between exploration and exploitation when seeking the optimal solution.\\n\\nTo eliminate the burdensome task of manual fine-tuning, recent research has proposed the concept of Meta-Black-Box Optimization (MetaBBO), which aims to refine the black-box optimizers by...\"}"}

This leads to a bi-level optimization framework, where the meta-level enhances the performance of low-level black-box optimizers. The meta-level approaches include supervised learning (MetaBBO-SL) [16\u201318], reinforcement learning (MetaBBO-RL) [19\u201325], and self-referential search (MetaBBO-SR) [26, 27]. Among them, MetaBBO-RL models the optimizer fine-tuning as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and learns an agent to automatically make decisions about the algorithmic configurations. By automating the tuning process, MetaBBO-RL not only significantly reduces the time and effort needed for customizing algorithms to specific unseen problems, but also potentially enhances the overall optimization performance.\\n\\nDespite the success, MetaBBO-RL calls for a unified benchmark platform. Upon examining the recently proposed MetaBBO-RL approaches [19\u201325], we found that while several approaches claim state-of-the-art performance, they lack a comprehensive benchmark and comparison using a standardized, unified testbed. As a result, identifying which approach truly excels under specific conditions poses a significant challenge, thereby hindering further progress and advancement in this field.\\n\\nTo bridge the gap, we introduce MetaBox, the first benchmark platform for MetaBBO-RL. The blueprint of MetaBox is illustrated in Figure 1, aiming to offer researchers a convenient means to develop and evaluate the MetaBBO-RL approaches. Specifically, we have made the following efforts:\\n\\n1. To simplify the development of MetaBBO-RL and ensure an automated workflow:\\n   1) We introduce a MetaBBO-RL Template, depicted at the top left of Figure 1. It comprises two main components: the meta-level RL agent and the low-level optimizer, where we provided several implemented works (e.g., [19, 21, 24, 25]) following a unified interface protocol. 2) We automate the Train-Test-Log procedure in MetaBox, shown in the middle of Figure 1. The users simply need to complete their MetaBBO-RL template, specify the target problem set, and select several baselines for comparison. Initiating the entire automated process is as straightforward as executing the run_experiment() command. This provides users with considerable flexibility in implementing different types of internal logic for their MetaBBO-RL algorithms while benefiting from the automated workflow.\\n\\n2. To facilitate broad and standardized comparison studies:\\n   1) We integrate a large-scale MetaBox testsuite consisting of over 300 benchmark problems with diverse landscape characteristics (such as single-/multi-modal, non-ill/ill-conditioned, strong/weak global structured, and noiseless/noisy). Showing in the left centre of Figure 1, the MetaBox testsuite inherits problem definitions from the well-known COCO [28] platform and the Protein-Docking benchmark (version 4.0) [29], with several modifications to adapt to the MetaBBO paradigms. 2) We develop a Baseline Library, located at the bottom left in\"}"}

As shown in 2, MetaBBO methods operate within a bi-level optimization framework designed to automate the fine-tuning process for a given BBO optimizer. Distinguishing themselves from conventional BBO techniques, MetaBBO methods introduce a novel meta-level as an automatic decision process. The purpose is to alleviate the need for labor-intensive manual fine-tuning of low-level BBO optimizers. Typically, they require the ability to generalize behaviors to address previously unseen problems through extensive training in a given problem distribution. Concretely:\\n\\n1) At the meta level, the meta optimizer (e.g., an RL agent) dynamically configures the low-level optimizer based on the current optimization status at that particular time step. Then, the meta optimizer evaluates the performance of the low-level optimizer over the subsequent optimization steps, referred to as meta performance. The meta optimizer leverages this observed meta performance to refine its decision-making process, training itself through the maximization of accumulated meta performance, thereby advancing its meta objective.\\n\\n2) At the lower level, the BBO optimizer receives a designated algorithmic configuration from the meta optimizer. With this configuration in hand, the low-level optimizer embarks on the task of optimizing the target objective. It observes the changes in the objective values across consecutive optimization steps and transmits this information back to the meta optimizer, thereby contributing to the meta performance signal.\\n\\nMetaBBO-RL. It leverages reinforcement learning at the meta-level to configure the low-level black-box optimizer for boosting meta-performance [26] over a problem distribution. It involves three components: an RL agent (policy) $\\\\Pi_{\\\\theta}$, a backbone black-box optimizer $\\\\Lambda$, and a dataset $D$ following certain problem distribution. The environment $Env$ in MetaBBO-RL is formed by coupling the optimizer with a problem from the dataset, i.e., $Env := \\\\{\\\\Lambda, f = \\\\text{sample}(D)\\\\}$, where $f$ represents the sampled problem. Unlike traditional RL tasks [32, 33], the environments in MetaBBO-RL not only include the problem of optimizing but also include the low-level optimizer itself. At each step $t$, the agent queries the optimization status $s_t$, which includes the current solutions produced by $\\\\Lambda$ and their evaluated values by $f$. The policy $\\\\Pi_{\\\\theta}$ takes $s_t$ as input and suggests an action $a_t = \\\\Pi_{\\\\theta}(s_t)$ to configure the optimizer $\\\\Lambda$. Note that the action space of different MetaBBO algorithms can vary largely, as it could involve determining solution update strategy [19, 20, 23], generating hyperparameter [21, 24, 25], or both of the above two [22]. Subsequently, $Env$ executes $a_t$ to obtain the...\"}"}

Apart from MetaBBO-RL, two other paradigms include MetaBBO-SL [16\u201318] and MetaBBO-SR [26, 27], which all belong to the MetaBBO community but leverage different approaches at the meta-level. Existing MetaBBO-SL methods consider a recurrent neural network (RNN) that helps determine the next solutions at each step [16\u201318]. However, they often encounter a dilemma in setting the horizon of RNN training: a longer length improves the difficulty of training, whereas a shorter length requires breaking the entire optimization process into small pieces, often resulting in unsatisfactory results. MetaBBO-SR utilizes black-box optimizers (such as an evolution strategy [35]) at both the meta and low levels to enhance the overall optimization performance. Since the black-box optimizers themselves can be computationally expensive, the MetaBBO-SR approaches may suffer from limited efficiency due to their inherently nested structure.\\n\\nRelated BBO benchmarks. Existing benchmarks for MetaBBO are currently absent. However, there are several related BBO benchmark platforms, including COCO [28] and IOHprofiler [38, 39] for continuous optimization, ACLib [44] for algorithm configuration, Olympus [45] for planning tasks, and Bayesmark [40] for hyper-parameter tuning. These platforms provide test suites, logging tools and some baselines for users to compare or refer to. In addition to these platforms, some BBO competitions provide a series of problems to evaluate specific aspects of algorithms, such as the GECCO BBOB workshop series (based on COCO [28]), the NeurIPS BBO challenge [41] (based on Bayesmark [40]), the IEEE CEC competition series [36], and the Zigzag BBO [42, 43] that consists of highly challenging problems. In contrast, our proposed MetaBox introduces a novel benchmark platform specifically tailored for MetaBBO-RL. It provides an algorithm development template, an automated execution philosophy, a wide range of test suites, an extensive collection of baselines, specific MetaBBO performance metrics, and powerful visualization tools. In Table 1, we compare MetaBox and other related benchmarks to showcase the novelty of this work.\\n\\n3 MetaBox: Design and Resources\\n\\n3.1 Template coding and workflow automation\\n\\nThe core structure of MetaBox is presented on the left of Figure 3, shown in the form of a UML class diagram [46]. Drawing from the recent MetaBBO-RL, we abstract the MetaBBO-RL Template into two classes: the reinforcement Agent and the backbone Optimizer (both marked in pale orange).\\n\\nTo develop or integrate a new MetaBBO-RL approach, users are required to specify their settings in the attributes Agent.config and Optimizer.config, and implement the following interfaces:\\n\\n1) Agent.train_episode(env) for the training procedure, 2) Agent.rollout_episode(env) for the rollout procedure, and 3) Optimizer.update(action, problem) for the optimization procedure. Once these interfaces are set, the implemented templates seamlessly integrate with other components, requiring no extra adjustments. Except for the Agent and Optimizer classes, the other classes are hidden from users, simplifying coding tasks and ensuring code consistency.\"}"}

Users can inherit from MetaBBO-RL templates highlighted in orange to enable polymorphism.\\n\\nRight: The automated Train-Test-Log workflow. The Agent directs the low-level (inner loop) optimization and trains itself on meta-level (outer loop), followed by testing and post-processing.\\n\\nGiven an implemented approach based on the MetaBBO-RL Template, the right side of Figure 3 illustrates the entirely automated Train-Test-Log workflow in MetaBox. The process initiates when a user launches the function `run_experiment()`. Then, function `Trainer.train()` executes an outer-loop for meta-level iterations, where a runtime RL environment (`env`) is instantiated by pairing a problem from the trainset with an optimizer instance. The `Agent.train_episode(env)` function is then called to start an inner-loop for the BBO iterations, during which the optimizer in `env` follows the action informed by `Agent` and applies its update function to optimize the target BBO problem until the predefined function evaluation budget is exhausted. The meta-iteration ends when the `Agent` has trained its policy model for $M$ steps. Next, the `Tester.test()` function is called to evaluate the learned policy on the testset through $N$ independent runs, recording the statistic results. Finally, the `Logger.log()` function restores all saved training and testing results. These basic results are further post-processed into comprehensive metrics for in-depth analysis. The key to this automation resides in the universal internal-call bridging the MetaBBO-RL Template and the Train-Test-Log workflow, thereby obviating the need for users to grapple with complex coding tasks.\\n\\n3.2 Testsuites\\n\\nThe testsuites integrated into MetaBox are briefly described as follows (more details in Appendix A):\\n\\n- **Synthetic.** It consists of 24 functions in five groups: separable, moderate, ill-conditioned, multi-modal with global structure, and multi-modal with weakly structured. They are collected from the `coco:bbob` function set in the renowned COCO platform [28].\\n\\n- **Noisy-Synthetic.** It consists of 30 noisy functions from the `coco:bbob-noisy` function set [28], by extending the Synthetic set with different noise models and levels. The noises come from three different models: Gaussian noise, Uniform noise and Cauchy noise [47].\\n\\n- **Protein-Docking.** It is extracted from the Protein-Docking benchmark [29], with 280 instances of different protein-protein complexes. These problems are characterized by rugged objective landscapes and are computationally expensive to evaluate.\\n\\nBesides, we make the following efforts to adapt the above testsuites, while enhancing usability and flexibility: 1) We treat each testsuite as a dataset and split it into training and testing sets according to a particular proportion, referred to as difficulty. This proportion determines the level of difficulty in generalizing or transferring the learned knowledge to unseen instances during testing. We provide two modes for controlling this aspect: easy mode, allocating 75% of the selected instances for training, and difficult mode, designating 25% of the selected instances for training. 2) Instead of providing predefined problem dimension candidates, such as {2,3,5,10,20,40} in COCO [28] and {10,30} in CEC2021 [34], we introduce an additional control parameter `problem-dim` to support customized problem dimension. 3) We also recognize that there is a potential user group (e.g., those in [16\u201318]).\"}"}

We meticulously filled the Optimizer template (see Section 3.1) with their specific internal logic. However, there are a few exceptions: CMA-ES, DE and PSO are implemented by calling APIs of DEAP \\\\[53\\\\] (an evolutionary computation framework with LGPL-3.0 license), and BO is implemented by the Scikit-Optimizer \\\\[54\\\\] (a BO solver set with BSD-3-Clause license). This showcases the compatibility of MetaBox with existing open-sourced optimization codebases. For MetaBBO-RL, we first encapsulate the internal logic of the RL agent into the Agent template (see Section 3.1), and then encapsulate the internal logic of the backbone optimizer into the Optimizer template. This showcases the ease of integrating various MetaBBO-RL methods into MetaBox. In addition, we provide an example of a MetaBBO-SL approach, RNN-OI, to showcase that MetaBox is compatible with other MetaBBO methods.\\n\\n3.4 Performance metrics\\n\\nIn MetaBox, we implement three standardized metrics to evaluate the performance of MetaBBO-RL approaches from aspects of both the BBO performance and the training efficacy. AEI.\\n\\nThe MetaBBO approaches can be evaluated using traditional BBO performance metrics, including the best objective value, the budget to achieve a predefined accuracy (convergence rate), and the runtime complexity \\\\[28, 36, 39\\\\]. In addition to analyzing them separately, we propose the Aggregated Evaluation Indicator (AEI), a unified scoring system to provide users with a comprehensive assessment. Aggregating these metrics together is challenging due to the significant variation in values across different metrics and problems. To address this, the AEI normalizes and combines the three metrics in the following way. We test a MetaBBO-RL approach on $K$ problem instances for $N$ repeated runs and then record the basic metrics (usually pre-processed by a min-max conversion for consistency towards AEI maximization, refer to Appendix B for details): best objective value $v_{k,n}^{\\\\text{obj}}$, consumed function evaluation times $v_{k,n}^{\\\\text{fes}}$, and runtime complexity $v_{k,n}^{\\\\text{com}}$. To make the values more distinguishable and manageable, they have been first subjected to a logarithmic transformation: $v_{k,n}^{\\\\ast} = \\\\log(v_{k,n}^{\\\\ast})$. Then, Z-score normalization is applied: $Z_{k}^{\\\\ast} = \\\\frac{1}{N} \\\\sum_{n=1}^{N} v_{k,n}^{\\\\ast} - \\\\mu^{\\\\ast} \\\\sigma^{\\\\ast}$, where $\\\\mu^{\\\\ast}$ and $\\\\sigma^{\\\\ast}$ are calculated by using RS as a baseline. Finally, the AEI is calculated by: $AEI = \\\\frac{1}{K} \\\\sum_{k=1}^{K} \\\\exp(Z_{k}^{\\\\text{obj}} + Z_{k}^{\\\\text{com}} + Z_{k}^{\\\\text{res}})$, where Z-scores are first aggregated, then subjected to an inverse logarithmic transformation, and subsequently averaged across the test problem instances. A higher AEI indicates better performance of the corresponding MetaBBO-RL approach.\"}"}

In this section, we provide several examples to illustrate the use of MetaBox in experimental studies.\\n\\n4.1 Experimental setup\\n\\nTo initiate the fully automated $\\\\text{Train-Test-Log}$ process of MetaBox, users need to follow two steps: 1) indicate environment parameters, including problem-type, problem-dim and difficulty, to inform MetaBox about the problem set, its dimension and the train-test split used in the comparison study; and 2) specify the maximum number of training steps ($M$), the number of independent test runs ($N$), and the reserved function evaluation times ($\\\\text{maxFEs}$) for solving a problem instance. Once these two steps are completed, users can trigger the $\\\\text{run\\\\_experiment()}$ to enjoy the full automation process. In the exemplary study below, $M$, $N$ and $\\\\text{maxFEs}$ are set to $1 \\\\times 10^6$, 51, and $2 \\\\times 10^4$, respectively, unless specified otherwise. All results presented are obtained using a machine of Intel i9-10980XE CPU with 32 GB RAM. Note that MetaBox is also compatible with other platforms. We provide default control parameters for each baseline, which are listed in Appendix C.\\n\\n4.2 Comparison of different baseline (Meta)BBO methods\\n\\nWe train all MetaBBO baselines (7 MetaBBO-RL and 1 MetaBBO-SL) in the Baseline Library on Synthetic and Protein-Docking testsuites, using both easy and difficult train-test split. We then test these baselines against the classic black-box optimizers available in our library and calculate the AEI of each algorithm. The results are depicted in Figure 4. On the Synthetic testsuites, two MetaBBO-RL methods, namely LDE and RLEPSO, show competitive performance against classic baselines. Specifically, LDE outperforms JDE21, the winner of IEEE CEC 2021 BBO Competitions [34], on the Synthetic-difficult testsuites, while RLEPSO outperforms both JDE21 and NL-SHADE-LBC, the winner of IEEE CEC 2022 BBO Competitions [55], on the Synthetic-easy testsuites. However, for this particular problem set, CMA-ES remains a strong baseline. As we shift to more realistic testsuites (Protein-docking of 280 instances), most baselines show varying degrees of performance drop. Notably, CMA-ES is inferior to a number of algorithms such as DEDQN, LDE, RLEPSO, and GLPSO. In general, we observe that MetaBBO-RL methods are more robust than classic hand-crafted\"}"}

We noticed that LDE achieved lower AEI scores on Synthetic-easy testsuites than some classic optimizers such as JDE21 and MadDE (see Figure 4).

To bridge this gap, we have introduced two explicit indicators (namely the MGD and MTE) in MetaBox to measure the level of learning achieved by a MetaBBO-RL algorithm. In Figure 6, we display the values of MGD and MTE for the MetaBBO-RL approach LDE.\\n\\nGeneralization performance.\\n\\nResults in the MGD plot (the left part of Figure 6) show that the pre-trained LDE model possesses a strong generalization ability. When the model is pre-trained on the Noisy-Synthetic testsuites, it exhibits a positive MGD on the Synthetic testsuites, with only a 2.222% drop in AEI, which is considered acceptable. Additionally, the LDE model trained on the Protein-Docking-easy or Synthetic-easy testsuites both exhibits exceptional generalization to the Noisy-Synthetic-easy testsuites, as evidenced by an MGD of $-7.006\\\\%$ and $-7.049\\\\%$. Such robust generalization abilities are highly desirable in practical applications.\\n\\nTransfer performance.\\n\\nWe fine-tune the LDE pre-trained on the Noisy-Synthetic testsuites for the Synthetic testsuites. The progress of this fine-tuning process is depicted in the MTE plot (the right part of Figure 6), showing the average return over 10 trials. The results reveal that the pre-trained LDE requires fewer learning steps to arrive at the peak return level than the LDE trained from scratch, with the MTE value of 20%. Compared with the MGD value of 2.222% when zero-shotting the pre-trained LDE for the Synthetic testsuites, it can be noticed that the MGD and MTE capture two different aspects of the learning effectiveness. By considering both measures, researchers can gain deeper insights into the learning behavior and effectiveness of their MetaBBO-RL approaches.\\n\\n5 Discussion and Future Work\\n\\nWe propose MetaBox, a benchmark platform for Meta-Black-Box Optimization with Reinforcement Learning (MetaBBO-RL). It intends to, 1) provide the first unified benchmark platform, 2) simplify coding towards efficient researching, 3) provide broad testsuites and baselines for comprehensive comparison, and 4) provide novel evaluation metrics for in-depth analysis.\\n\\nOur preliminary experimental investigations lead to the following key observations. First, although hand-crafted optimizers currently outperform learning-based optimizers (e.g., MetaBBO-RL), they are mostly designed to specific problem sets and become less effective when applied to other problem domains. In contrast, MetaBBO-RL exhibits adaptability across various optimization scenarios,\"}"}

This is a significant advantage, as it allows MetaBBO-RL to perform well on diverse problem sets without the need for much manual customization. Second, there is still room for further improvement in MetaBBO-RL, by discovering more effective designs in both meta-level agents and low-level optimizers. We find that even basic modifications, such as incorporating a PPO agent and adjusting the population size, can bring a significant performance boost. Third, interpreting the generalization and transfer effects in MetaBBO-RL can be challenging. While we were able to observe positive and negative effects in terms of MGD and MTE, rationally interpreting and understanding them is still difficult. Hence, additional studies are needed to interpret the learning effects of MetaBBO-RL in a more comprehensible manner.\\n\\nWhile our MetaBox presents a significant advancement, we also acknowledge its potential limitations. It is important to note that the evaluation of BBO performance is not a one-size-fits-all endeavour. Different practical applications may have varying preferences and additional concerns, such as solution robustness, solution diversity, parallelization and scalability. These nuances extend beyond the scope of a single evaluation metric. In conjunction with the proposed AEI, MetaBox is committed to exploring more pragmatic and advanced evaluation criteria. Moreover, the problem sets in MetaBox will be expanded to include more diverse and eye-catching BBO tasks. Additionally, proactive maintenance and updates to MetaBox, including the extension of the baseline library, will also be pursued to ensure it is up-to-date with the latest methodologies in the field.\\n\\nAcknowledgments and Disclosure of Funding\\n\\nThis work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 62276100, in part by the Guangdong Natural Science Funds for Distinguished Young Scholars under Grant 2022B1515020049, in part by the Guangdong Regional Joint Funds for Basic and Applied Research under Grant 2021B1515120078, and in part by the TCL Young Scholars Program.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\n[1] Matthias Feurer and Frank Hutter.

The objective of ab initio protein docking, for a fixed basis protein conformation $x_0$, is to minimize the change in Gibbs free energy resulting from protein interaction between $x_0$ and any other conformation $x$, denoted as $E_{int}(x, x_0)$. Following the approach of Moal and Bates [57], we formulate the objective as follows:\\n\\n$$\\\\min_{x} E_{int}(x, x_0) = \\\\sum_{i=1}^{\\\\text{atoms}} \\\\sum_{j=1}^{\\\\text{atoms}} E(x_i, x_j),$$\\n\\n(6)\\n\\nwhere $E(x_i, x_j)$ is the energy between any pair atoms of $x$ and $x_0$, and is defined as:\\n\\n$$E_{i,j} = \\\\begin{cases} \\nq_i q_j \\\\epsilon_{r_{i,j}} + \\\\sqrt{\\\\epsilon_{i} \\\\epsilon_{j}} h(R_{i,j} \\\\epsilon_{i,j})^{12} - (R_{i,j} \\\\epsilon_{i,j})^{6}, & \\\\text{if} \\\\quad r_{i,j} < 7 \\\\\\\\\\n(q_{i,j} \\\\epsilon_{r_{i,j}} + \\\\sqrt{\\\\epsilon_{i} \\\\epsilon_{j}} h(R_{i,j} \\\\epsilon_{i,j})^{12} - (R_{i,j} \\\\epsilon_{i,j})^{6}), \\\\text{if} \\\\quad 7 \\\\leq r_{i,j} \\\\leq 9 \\\\\\\\\\n0, & \\\\text{if} \\\\quad r_{i,j} > 9 \\n\\\\end{cases}$$\\n\\n(7)\\n\\nAll parameters and calculations are taken from the Charmm19 force field [58].

Each complex is associated with 10 different starting points, chosen from the top-10 start points identified by ZDOCK [59]. Consequently, the Protein-Docking testsuites comprise a total of 280 docking task instances. We split these instances into two parts, with approximately 75% and 25% of the instances serving as the difficulty levels within the testsuites. It is important to note that we parameterize the search space as $R^{12}$, which is a reduced dimensionality compared to the original protein complex [56]. This reduction in dimensionality enables computational time savings while retaining the optimization nature of the problem. Due to the computationally expensive evaluations, the maximum number of function evaluations ($maxFEs$) is set to $10^3$. The default search range for the optimization is $[-\\\\infty, \\\\infty]$.\\n\\n### B Details of AEI Calculation\\n\\nWe describe the calculations of AEI as follows. Suppose we want to test a (Meta)BBO approach $\\\\Lambda$ to obtain its AEI on Testsuites $A$, i.e., $AEI(\\\\Lambda, A)$. Suppose $A$ has $K$ problem instances, and we run $\\\\Lambda$ to optimize each problem in $A$ for $N$ times. In this testing process, we record 3 kinds of values:\\n\\n- **Best objective value.** The best objective value $v_{k,n}^{obj}$ denotes the best objective found by $\\\\Lambda$ on the $k$-th problem during the $n$-th test run. To convert its monotonicity, we conduct an inverse transformation, i.e., $v_{k,n}^{obj} = 1/v_{k,n}^{obj}$.\\n\\n- **Consumed function evaluations.** We let $v_{k,n}^{fes}$ denote the number of consumed function evaluations when the approach $\\\\Lambda$ terminates the optimization process for the $k$-th problem during the $n$-th test run, where $\\\\Lambda$ would terminate the optimization either upon locating a high-quality solution that fulfils a predetermined accuracy or when it reaches the maximum allowed function evaluations, i.e., $maxFEs$. We then pre-process this value by a min-max conversion for the consistency towards AEI maximization, i.e., $v_{k,n}^{fes} = maxFEs \\\\cdot v_{k,n}^{fes}$.\\n\\n- **Runtime complexity.** The calculation includes three steps following the conventions of IEEE CEC Competitions [34, 55]. We first pre-calculate a $T_0$ which is a basic normalization term, calculating the computation time of some basic numpy operations (e.g., add, division, log, exp) as references. We record the time $T_{k,n}^1$ for $\\\\Lambda$ to evaluate the $k$-th problem's objective during $n$-th run, and $T_{k,n}^2$ as total running time for $\\\\Lambda$ to solve the $k$-th problem's objective during $n$-th run. The runtime complexity $v_{k,n}^{com}$ is then calculated by $T_{k,n}^2 - T_{k,n}^1 / T_0$. Then we pre-process this value by a min-max conversion for consistency towards AEI maximization, i.e., $v_{k,n}^{obj} = 1/v_{k,n}^{obj}$.\\n\\n### C Baseline Setup\\n\\n**Classic optimizer.** Random Search does not necessitate any control parameters. We establish the control parameters for CMA-ES, DE, and PSO in alignment with DEAP [53], while the control parameters for BO are set in accordance with Scikit-Optimizer [54]. For the classic optimizers implemented by us, the control parameters are delineated and can be accessed at https://github.com/GMC-DRL/MetaBox/blob/main/src/control_parameters_classic.md.\\n\\n**MetaBBO-SL.** We briefly introduce the control parameters of RNN-OI here. It adopts an LSTM network to generate the next solution position on the observation of some present optimization status. This LSTM has input size as $problem_dim + 2$, hidden size as 32, and projection size as $problem_dim$. The Adam optimizer is used to train the network with a fixed learning rate $10^{-5}$. However, it can only optimize a problem for around $maxFEs = 100$ due to the inefficiency arising from utilizing RNNs to model an extended optimization horizon.\"}"}
