However, as models continue to improve, their performance on these benchmarks has begun to plateau, making it increasingly difficult to discern differences in model capabilities. This paper introduces MMLU-Pro, an enhanced dataset designed to extend the mostly knowledge-driven MMLU benchmark by integrating more challenging, reasoning-focused questions and expanding the choice set from four to ten options. Additionally, MMLU-Pro eliminates the trivial and noisy questions in MMLU. Our experimental results show that MMLU-Pro not only raises the challenge, causing a significant drop in accuracy by 16% to 33% compared to MMLU but also demonstrates greater stability under varying prompts. With 24 different prompt styles tested, the sensitivity of model scores to prompt variations decreased from 4-5% in MMLU to just 2% in MMLU-Pro. Additionally, we found that models utilizing Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning achieved better performance on MMLU-Pro compared to direct answering, which is in stark contrast to the findings on the original MMLU, indicating that MMLU-Pro includes more complex reasoning questions. Our assessments confirm that MMLU-Pro is a more discriminative benchmark to better track progress in the field.\"}"}

These models, including state-of-the-art examples like GPT-4, Gemini, and Claude [2, 30, 6], are pushing the envelope both in general applicability across various tasks and specialized performance in specific areas. A key objective in this ongoing development is achieving expert-level intelligence, characterized by performance that meets or surpasses the top 10% of skilled adults in a diverse range of tasks [26].\\n\\nTo effectively track the progress towards the goal of this expert-level intelligence, it is essential to evaluate these models on a broad range of tasks. There are multiple popular benchmarks used to measure such general intelligence. For example, AGIEval [48] focuses on general-exam questions from SAT, Gaokao, GRE, etc. ARC [12] focuses on science-based questions. BBH [33] focuses on solving hard synthetic tasks. MMLU [18] includes a broad range of exam questions from 57 subjects across STEM, the humanities, the social sciences, etc. Among these benchmarks, MMLU emerged as the de facto standard for evaluating LLMs due to its broad coverage and high quality. However, the rapid progress of current LLMs has quickly led to performance saturation on MMLU. Since GPT-4 achieved 86.4% in March 2023, there has not been any significant progress on the benchmark. Most recent frontier models like GPT-4-Turbo, Gemini-1.5-Pro, Claude, and LLaMA-3-400B (all published in early-mid 2024) all settle at an accuracy between 86% - 87%. The recent published GPT-4o has achieved remarkable performance boost (10+% improvement) on MATH [19], Chatbot Arena [11]. However, it only obtains 1% improvement on MMLU to obtain 87.4%. This leads us to re-examine the effectiveness of MMLU in measuring future (stronger) LLMs. Besides the saturation issue, the performance on MMLU is also known to be highly sensitive to the prompt and scoring function [47, 3], which causes significant order changes in the leaderboard. Here, we conjecture that these issues are due to the following causes:\\n\\n1. The questions in MMLU only have three distractor options. LLMs could potentially exploit shortcuts to derive the answer without truly understanding the rationale. This could lead to an overestimate of LLMs' true performance, also leading to a degree of instability.\\n\\n2. The questions in MMLU are mostly knowledge-driven without requiring too much reasoning, especially in the STEM subjects, which reduces its difficulty. In fact, most models achieve better performance with 'direct' answer prediction without chain-of-thought [41].\\n\\n3. There is a portion of questions that are either unanswerable or mistakenly annotated. This dataset noise leads to a lower ceiling, which the frontier models hit.\\n\\nThese issues have highlighted the need for more challenging, discriminative, and reliable datasets to track the progress of LLMs. In this paper, we introduce MMLU-Pro: a comprehensive benchmark designed for proficient-level multi-discipline language understanding and reasoning. MMLU-Pro spans 14 diverse domains including mathematics, physics, chemistry, law, engineering, psychology, and health, encompassing over 12,000 questions and thus meeting the breadth requirement. MMLU-Pro is distinctive from MMLU in the following aspects:\\n\\n1. MMLU-Pro has ten options, which contain 3x more distractors than MMLU. By increasing the distractor numbers, we significantly reduce the probability of correct guess by chance to boost the benchmark's difficulty and robustness.\\n\\n2. MMLU-Pro increases the portion of challenging college-level exam problems. These questions require LLM to perform deliberate reasoning in different domains to derive the final answer.\\n\\n3. We integrate two rounds of expert reviews to reduce the noise of the dataset. The first round is based on expert verification. In the second round, we utilize the SoTA LLMs to identify potential errors and employ annotators to perform more targeted verification.\\n\\nWe evaluated more than 50 LLMs including open-source and closed-source models, such as GPT-4o [17], Claude-3-Opus [6], and Gemini [30], LLaMA-3 [35], Phi-3 [1] on MMLU-Pro. Our key findings are summarized as follows:\\n\\n1. MMLU-Pro presents significant challenges; notably, the leading model, GPT-4o, only achieves an accuracy of 72.6% and GPT-4-Turbo reaches 63.7%, indicating substantial room for improvement.\"}"}

MMLU-Pro is more discriminative than MMLU in distinguishing the nuances between models. For example, the gap between GPT-4o and GPT-4-Turbo is 1% on MMLU, while it becomes 9% on MMLU-Pro. This discriminative nature makes MMLU-Pro a more suitable benchmark.\\n\\n3. Advanced open-source models like Llama-3-70B-Instruct [24] and DeepSeek-V2-Chat [15], while not yet performing at the level of leading closed-source models such as GPT-4o and Claude-3-Opus, have shown performance that is close to Claude-3-Sonnet.\\n\\n4. MMLU-Pro necessitates chain-of-thought (CoT) [41] to achieve promising results. For instance, CoT can boost the performance of GPT-4o by 19%. In contrast, CoT will actually hurt the performance of models on MMLU. This reflects the necessity to perform deliberate reasoning on MMLU-Pro, which is not required in the knowledge-driven MMLU questions.\\n\\n5. Our error analysis on 120 erroneous cases of GPT-4o, the current top-performing model, reveals that 39% of errors are due to flaws in the reasoning process, 35% stem from a lack of specific domain expertise, and another 12% from computational errors. These results highlight the MMLU-Pro benchmark's difficulties and indicate areas needing further research and model enhancement.\\n\\n2 Related Work\\n2.1 Large Language Models\\nRecent advancements in LLMs have significantly propelled the field of natural language processing. GPT-3 [7] demonstrated robust few-shot prediction capabilities, interpreting tasks and examples from natural language inputs. Subsequent models like InstructGPT [28], which employ human-feedback reinforcement learning, have achieved strong user instruction-following capability. More recent models including GPT-4o, GPT-4, Claude-3, Gemini, and Llama-3, have shown notable improvements in complex reasoning across various domains. To rigorously assess and push the capabilities of these LLMs, we introduce MMLU-Pro, a new benchmark designed to test the upper limits of reasoning and knowledge in advanced language models.\\n\\n2.2 LLMs Evaluation Benchmarks\\nIn recent years, the development of various benchmarks has significantly enhanced the evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs). For instance, GLUE [38] and its successor SuperGLUE [37], have played a pivotal role in advancing language understanding tasks, setting the stage for more specialized evaluations. Other recent benchmarks, including MMLU [18], HELM [22], BigBench [32], Hel-laSwag [45], and the AI2 Reasoning Challenge (ARC) [12], have broadened the scope by assessing capabilities across language generation, knowledge understanding, and complex reasoning [9].\\n\\nTo facilitate performance comparison across diverse LLMs, several leaderboards have been established, such as the OpenLLM Leaderboard [27] and OpenCompass [14]. However, as LLM capabilities have rapidly advanced, leaderboard scores have become increasingly concentrated at the top, with models like GPT-4 achieving near-perfect scores on multiple benchmarks. This trend highlights the urgent need for more challenging benchmarks to fully test the limits of LLM capabilities.\\n\\nRecent studies have revealed that the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) on current benchmarks is not robust to minor perturbations [25, 31]. Specifically, slight variations in the style or phrasing of prompts can lead to significant shifts in model scores. Beyond the inherent non-robustness of the models themselves, the typical four-option format of multiple-choice questions (MCQs) also contributes to this instability in model scoring. This format may not sufficiently challenge the models or differentiate between closely performing systems, leading to potential overestimations of their capabilities. Our new benchmark, MMLU-Pro, aims to address these issues by introducing more complex questions and increasing the number of answer choices from four to ten, thus enhancing performance differentiation and reducing the likelihood of correct guesses by chance.\\n\\n3 The MMLU-Pro Benchmark\\n3.1 Overview\\nOur dataset comprises 14 discipline subsets, totaling 12,032 questions, with their distribution and origins detailed in Figure 3. It integrates questions from several sources: (1) Original MMLU\"}"}

This restructuring aims to better focus the evaluation on key areas of knowledge and reduce redundancy. We also aim to eliminate overly simple questions that fail to challenge the models effectively. We employ eight models: Llama-2-7B, Llama-2-7B-Chat, Llama-2-13B, Llama-2-13B-Chat [35], Mistral-7B [20], Gemma-7B [34], Yi-6B, and Yi-6B-Chat [43]. Each model is evaluated on the MMLU, and questions answered correctly by more than four models are considered as \u201ctoo easy\u201d and subsequently excluded from consideration. Using this criterion, a total of 5,886 questions are filtered out across the various subjects.\\n\\nQuestion Collection and Integration\\n\\nWe then expand our dataset by incorporating questions from the STEM Website, TheoremQA [10], and SciBench [40]. It is important to note that the questions from the STEM Website are in the form of problem statements with solutions, while those from TheoremQA are in the format of questions accompanied by brief answers. To adapt these for our dataset, we utilize GPT-4-Turbo to extract short answers from the solutions, serving as the correct answer options. We also generate three additional distractors for each question. We then compare the solutions with the extracted answers manually, to remove questions where the extracted answers are incomplete or incorrect. This step is essential for aligning the STEM Website and TheoremQA questions with those from other sources, preparing them for future option augmentation.\\n\\nOption Augmentation\\n\\nWe enhance the question options from four to ten using GPT-4-Turbo, introducing six additional choices. These are not merely quantitative additions; rather, they serve as plausible distractors that necessitate discerning reasoning for correct selection. This approach...\"}"}

In this context, a \u2018false negative\u2019 refers to a correct option initially misclassified as incorrect. Subsequently, human experts rigorously review these identified options to ensure that actual distractors are indeed incorrect and distinctly different from the correct answer. In Table 1, we present a distribution of issues identified during the expert review process. For better illustration, we categorize them into three types:\\n\\n- **Incorrect Answers**: refer to instances where the provided answer is incorrect. There are two main sources of these errors: the pre-existing errors within the original MMLU dataset and errors on the STEM Website arising from flawed or incomplete answer extraction.\\n- **False Negative Options**: primarily arise from distractors generated in two key stages: converting single answers into four options from sources like the STEM Website and TheoremQA, and further expanding these four options to ten in the option augmentation phase. Human experts will remove each False Negative Option, keeping the correct answer and suitable distractors. In our dataset, 83% have ten options, 17% have fewer, and the average options count per question is 9.47.\\n- **Bad Questions**: include several problematic aspects: (1) Questions that require non-text information such as images or tables. (2) Questions that lack sufficient textual information to derive a conclusive answer. (3) Questions that are unsuitable for a multiple-choice format, such as proof problems, true or false questions, and open-ended questions.\\n\\n4 Experimental Setup\\n\\n**Few-Shot Chain-of-Thought Prompting**\\n\\nWe utilize a 5-shot Chain-of-Thought (CoT) [41] approach to measure model performance on challenging tasks presented by MMLU-Pro. This CoT reasoning, adapted from Chain-of-Thought Hub [16], incorporates essential reasoning steps from the original MMLU dataset. Our approach introduces two enhancements: firstly, extending the original options available from the Chain-of-Thought Hub, and secondly, selecting five representative demonstration examples for each discipline. Unlike traditional performance measures such as Perplexity (PPL) which primarily focus on linguistic probabilities, our method emphasizes reasoning capabilities, crucial for handling the complexities of MMLU-Pro. A comprehensive comparison of performances using direct answering and CoT methods will be presented in Section 6.2, demonstrating the effectiveness of the CoT approach.\\n\\n**Answer Extraction**\\n\\nTo extract answers from the model-generated reasoning content in response to the MMLU-Pro dataset, we initially use the regular expression 'answer is (A-J)?' to match the format specified in the prompt instructions and few-shot examples. If this regex fails to retrieve a valid response, possibly due to formatting deviations by the model, we employ a secondary regex '\\.*\\\\[aA\\\\]nswer: (A-J)' for a second attempt to extract the answer. If both of them fail to retrieve a valid response, a fallback mechanism is implemented where a random option from the answer choices is selected. This ensures consistent answer provision across all evaluations.\"}"}

The gap stretches from over 70% accuracy for GPT-4 to just over 20% for Mistral-7B-v0.1, illustrating a wide range in capabilities and underscoring the value of our benchmark in distinguishing these differences.\\n\\nHistory and Psychology:\\nIn knowledge-intensive subjects such as History and Psychology, models generally show a higher performance floor compared to reasoning-intensive disciplines. Interestingly, the DeepSeek-V2-Chat model underperforms relative to its peers in these subjects, indicating its comparatively stronger reasoning abilities over its knowledge retrieval capabilities.\\n\\nEngineering and Law:\\nAmong the 14 subjects evaluated, Engineering and Law consistently scored lower. Upon reviewing model outputs, we found that the lower scores in Engineering are largely due to the addition of new questions sourced from the STEM Website, which require complex formula derivations and multi-step calculations. This aspect leaves substantial room for improvement in future, more advanced models. Law scores suffer as questions become more intricate and detailed with additional options, necessitating a deeper understanding of legal reasoning.\\n\\n5.3 Error Analysis\\n\\nIn this section, we explore an error analysis of GPT-4, currently the best-performing model on the MMLU-Pro benchmark, to examine its performance strengths and weaknesses. This examination not only highlights areas where the model falls short but also provides insights that could inform future improvements in both its architecture and training processes. We conducted a detailed review of 120 randomly selected erroneous predictions made by GPT-4. These errors were analyzed by expert annotators who determined the underlying causes of each misprediction using their expert judgment. Specific cases and further detailed discussions are provided in Appendix A.6.\\n\\nReasoning Errors (39%)\\nThe model frequently encounters difficulties with logical reasoning, even when it recalls the correct information and knowledge. These issues often arise from logical inconsistencies in its responses, likely due to its dependence on recognizing patterns in training data rather than engaging in a true understanding of the problem.\\n\\nLack of Specific Knowledge (35%)\\nA fundamental root cause of domain-specific errors in the GPT-4 model is the lack of specialized knowledge. Errors such as incorrect financial calculations and misapplications of optical principles highlight this issue.\\n\\nCalculation Errors (12%)\\nWe distinguish calculation errors from reasoning errors to aid model developers, as many AI systems can effectively utilize calculators or Python for complex, multi-step calculations. In our review of error cases, it is common to find instances where the model has the correct formula but makes errors in computing values.\\n\\nOther Errors\\nThe remaining errors include No Selection Made (5%), Question Understanding Errors (4%), Generation Issues (2%), Annotation Errors (2%), and Answer Extraction Errors (1%). These errors are attributed to various factors, such as limitations in final response selection, complex text interpretation challenges, limitations in response generation, inaccuracies in data annotation, and issues in extracting precise answers from model outputs.\\n\\n6 Comparison with MMLU\\n\\nIn this section, we will compare the MMLU and MMLU-Pro benchmarks from three perspectives: difficulty level, reasoning strength, and robustness degree.\\n\\n6.1 Difficulty Level\\nIn Figure 4, we present scores of different models on both MMLU and MMLU-Pro benchmarks. It is evident that as language model capabilities enhance, the scores on MMLU are not only increasing but also clustering closely together, making it difficult to distinguish between models. For instance,\"}"}

MMLU-Pro expands this range to approximately 10%. Similarly, the score difference between models like GPT-4o, Claude-3-Opus, and GPT-4-Turbo has widened from about 2% on MMLU to around 9% on MMLU-Pro. Additionally, the increased difficulty in MMLU-Pro ensures ample room for future model improvement. Currently, the best-performing model, GPT-4o, scores 72.6% on MMLU-Pro, leaving a substantial margin of 27.4% for potential improvement, whereas MMLU offers only about 11.3% space for further enhancement.\\n\\n6.2 Reasoning Level\\n\\nAccording to Table 3, we can observe differences in performance between the Chain of Thought (CoT) method and Direct Answering (DA) across various models on MMLU and MMLU-Pro. The comparison shows that the CoT method generally results in more significant performance improvements on MMLU-Pro compared to MMLU.\\n\\nSpecifically, GPT-4o improves by 1.5% using the Chain of Thought (CoT) method compared to direct answering on MMLU, while on MMLU-Pro, its improvement reaches 19.1%. Similarly, GPT-4-Turbo shows a 15.3% increase in performance using CoT over direct answering on MMLU-Pro, although its performance slightly decreases by 0.2% on MMLU. Other models such as Phi3-medium-4k-instruct, Llama-3-8B, and Gemma-7B also display similar trends, exhibiting greater performance improvements using CoT on MMLU-Pro compared to direct answering. These findings indicate that the MMLU-Pro benchmark is specifically designed to assess deeper and more complex reasoning skills, as evidenced by the enhanced performance of models using chain-of-thought (CoT), highlighting its focus on professional-level problem-solving.\\n\\n6.3 Robustness Degree\\n\\nIt is widely recognized that even minor variations in prompts can significantly impact model outputs, leading to substantial fluctuations when evaluating models. This poses challenges for accurately ranking models and maintaining consistent leaderboards [3]. This sensitivity is generally attributed to\"}"}

However, a high-quality benchmark should aim to minimize the impact of prompt variability on scores, ensuring more consistent and reliable evaluations.\\n\\nTo assess this, we evaluated models using 24 different but reasonable prompts. Figure 5 showcases the score range for different models under varying prompts. On the MMLU benchmark, the influence of these prompts generally ranges between 4-5%, with peaks up to 10.98%. In contrast, on the MMLU-Pro benchmark, the impact of prompt changes is generally around 2%, with a maximum of 3.74%. This reduced variability highlights an improvement in consistency and reliability over the original MMLU benchmark, ensuring more reliable assessments of language models\u2019 capabilities.\\n\\n7 Limitations\\nThe MMLU-Pro dataset, while enhancing the complexity of MMLU by incorporating more challenging, reasoning-focused questions, remains constrained by the limitations of the multiple-choice format. This format may not capture the depth of comprehension and creative response generation as effectively as open-ended answers, which better reflect real-world scenarios. Additionally, MMLU-Pro exclusively focuses on language models and does not include assessments for multi-modal models, limiting its applicability in scenarios requiring synthesis of visual, auditory, and textual data.\\n\\n8 Conclusion\\nIn this paper, we introduce MMLU-Pro, a more challenging benchmark designed to elevate the assessment of multi-task language understanding capabilities in language models. By incorporating more complex, reasoning-intensive tasks, MMLU-Pro addresses the performance saturation observed in previous benchmarks, effectively differentiating models\u2019 capabilities. Our evaluations show that even leading models like GPT-4o encounter significant challenges, indicating a successful increase in difficulty and an improvement in the benchmark\u2019s ability to test deeper cognitive processes. MMLU-Pro also enhances its robustness by reducing dependency on prompt styles, making it a valuable tool for advancing our understanding of AI language capabilities. As AI technology evolves, we hope MMLU-Pro plays a crucial role in pushing the boundaries of what language models can achieve.\\n\\nAcknowledgments and Disclosure of Funding\\nWe would like to thank Reddit user Dorrin Verrakai, who provided invaluable feedback for this work.

Think step by step and then finish your answer with \\\"The answer is (X)\\\" where X is the correct letter choice.\\n\\n**Question:**\\nA refracting telescope consists of two converging lenses separated by 100 cm. The eye-piece lens has a focal length of 20 cm. The angular magnification of the telescope is\\n\\nOptions:\\nA. 10, B. 40, C. 6, D. 25, E. 15, F. 50, G. 30, H. 4, I. 5, J. 20\\n\\n**Answer:**\\nLet's think step by step. In a refracting telescope, if both lenses are converging, the focus of both lenses must be between the two lenses, and thus the focal lengths of the two lenses must add up to their separation. Since the focal length of one lens is 20 cm, the focal length of the other must be 80 cm. The magnification is the ratio of these two focal lengths, or 4. The answer is (H).\\n\\n**Question:**\\nSay the pupil of your eye has a diameter of 5 mm and you have a telescope with an aperture of 50 cm. How much more light can the telescope gather than your eye?\\n\\nOptions:\\nA. 1000 times more B. 50 times more C. 5000 times more D. 500 times more E. 10000 times more F. 20000 times more G. 2000 times more H. 100 times more I. 10 times more J. N/A\\n\\n**Answer:**\\nLet's think step by step. The amount of light a telescope can gather compared to the human eye is proportional to the area of its apertures. The area of a circle is given by the formula $\\\\text{Area} = \\\\pi \\\\times \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\text{Diameter}}{2}\\\\right)^2$, where D is the diameter. Therefore, the relative light-gathering power is calculated as:\\n\\n$$\\\\frac{\\\\text{Area of telescope}}{\\\\text{Area of eye}} = \\\\frac{(50 \\\\text{ cm})^2}{(5 \\\\text{ mm})^2} = 500^2 = 10000.$$  \\n\\nThe answer is (E).\\n\\n**Question:**\\nWhere do most short-period comets come from and how do we know?\\n\\nOptions:\\nA. The Kuiper belt; short period comets tend to be in the plane of the solar system like the Kuiper belt.\\nB. The asteroid belt; short period comets tend to come from random directions indicating a spherical distribution of comets called the asteroid belt.\\nC. The asteroid belt; short period comets tend to be in the plane of the solar system just like the asteroid belt.\\nD. The Oort cloud; short period comets have orbital periods similar to asteroids like Vesta and are found in the plane of the solar system just like the Oort cloud.\\nE. The Oort Cloud; short period comets tend to come from random directions indicating a spherical distribution of comets called the Oort Cloud.\\nF. The Oort cloud; short period comets tend to be in the plane of the solar system just like the Oort cloud.\\nG. The asteroid belt; short period comets have orbital periods similar to asteroids like Vesta and are found in the plane of the solar system just like the asteroid belt.\\n\\n**Answer:**\\nLet's think step by step. Most short-period comets originate from the Kuiper belt. This is deduced from the observation that these comets tend to follow orbits that lie in the plane of the solar system, similar to the distribution of objects in the Kuiper belt itself. Thus, the alignment of these cometary orbits with the ecliptic plane points to their Kuiper belt origin. The answer is (A).\\n\\n**Question:**\\nColors in a soap bubble result from light\\n\\nOptions:\\nA. dispersion B. deflection C. refraction D. reflection E. interference F. converted to a different frequency G. polarization H. absorption I. diffraction J. transmission\\n\\n**Answer:**\\nLet's think step by step. The colorful patterns observed in a soap bubble are caused by the phenomenon of light interference. This occurs when light waves bounce between the two surfaces of the soap film, combining constructively or destructively based on their phase differences and the varying thickness of the film. These interactions result in vibrant color patterns due to variations in the intensity of different wavelengths of light. The answer is (E).\\n\\n**Question:**\\nA microwave oven is connected to an outlet, 120 V, and draws a current of 2 amps. At what rate is energy being used by the microwave oven?\\n\\nOptions:\\nA. 240 W B. 120 W C. 10 W D. 480 W E. 360 W F. 200 W G. 30 W H. 150 W I. 60 W J. 300 W\\n\\n**Answer:**\\nLet's think step by step. The rate of energy usage, known as power, in an electrical circuit is calculated by the product of voltage and current. For a microwave oven connected to a 120 V outlet and drawing a current of 2 amps, the power consumption can be calculated as follows:\\n\\n$$\\\\text{Power} = \\\\text{Voltage} \\\\times \\\\text{Current} = 120 \\\\text{ V} \\\\times 2 \\\\text{ A} = 240 \\\\text{ W}.$$  \\n\\nTherefore, the microwave oven uses energy at a rate of 240 watts. The answer is (A).\"}"}

This examination not only highlights areas where the model falls short but also provides insights that could inform future improvements in both its architecture and training processes. We conducted a detailed review of 120 randomly selected erroneous predictions made by GPT-4o. These errors were analyzed by expert annotators who determined the underlying causes of each misprediction using their expert judgment and any definitive explanations provided.\\n\\nReasoning Errors (39%)\\n\\nEven though the model may recall correct knowledge, it often struggles to logically process steps toward the right answer. This issue often stems from logical inconsistencies in the output, possibly caused by the model\u2019s reliance on patterns from its training data rather than true understanding. For instance, as shown in Table 10, when calculating the pressure difference inside and outside a container, the model erroneously added the internal and external pressures together.\\n\\nLack of Specific Knowledge (35%)\\n\\nA fundamental root cause of domain-specific errors in the GPT-4o model is the lack of specialized knowledge. For example, as shown in Table 8, the model lacks financial knowledge: The cash balance for interest calculation is determined by subtracting the down payment from the product price. Due to the incorrect use of $1650 instead of $1600 as the principal, the result was erroneous. Similarly, as in Table 9, the model did not correctly understand that when using a lens in different media, the ratio of the refractive indices of the lens material and the medium should be considered, rather than directly subtracting their numerical values. This lack of understanding of how to properly apply optical principles led to a misconception.\\n\\nCalculation Errors (12%)\\n\\nWe distinguish calculation errors from reasoning errors to aid model developers, as many AI systems can utilize calculators or Python for complex, multi-step calculations. For example, as in Table 11, the model had the correct formula for calculating the molecular weight of a compound but made an error in summing the values, leading to an incorrect final answer.\\n\\nOther Errors\\n\\nThe remaining errors include No Selection Made (5%), Question Understanding Errors (4%), Generation Issues (2%), Annotation Errors (2%), and Answer Extraction Errors (1%).\\n\\n\u201cNo Selection Made\u201d refers to instances where the model responded but did not select a final option as dictated by the prompt and few-shot format. \u201cQuestion Understanding Errors\u201d occur when the model incorrectly interprets the question or options, such as in Table 13 in the appendix, where the model incorrectly focused on Singer\u2019s broader views on equality for all beings rather than strictly on the equality principle as it applies to humans. The correct answer (E), focusing solely on human beings, was overlooked in favor of a broader interpretation (H). \u201cGeneration Issues\u201d refer to anomalies in the generation process, such as in Table 12 in the appendix, where the model repeatedly generated one sentence until it exceeded the maximum length and terminated. \u201cAnnotation Errors\u201d occur when the ground truth answer is incorrect. \u201cAnswer Extraction Errors\u201d refer to failures in extracting the chosen option due to an unusual format, causing the extraction script to fail in extracting the answer choice.\"}"}

To solve this problem, this equation is modified somewhat to avoid using densities in the expression (since the densities are unknown). However, the density is defined as mass per unit volume, and since the volume per mole of both gases, \\\\( \\\\text{C}_{18}\\\\text{H}_{34}\\\\text{O}_3 \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\text{CO}_2 \\\\), are the same, Graham's Law becomes\\n\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\frac{u_1}{u_2} = \\\\frac{s}{\\\\sqrt{M_2}}\\n\\\\]\\n\\nAnother modification is necessary before solving this problem: the mass of any substance is its molecular weight times the number of moles of that substance.

Singer is a well-known philosopher, particularly in the field of ethics, and he has written extensively on the topic of equality and animal rights.\\n\\nSinger\u2019s principle of equality is not about asserting that all humans are actually equal in abilities or characteristics. Instead, it is a moral principle prescribing how we should treat beings. Specifically, Singer argues that we should give equal consideration to the interests of all beings capable of suffering, whether they are human or nonhuman animals.\\n\\nGiven this understanding, let\u2019s evaluate the options:\\n\\nA. a description of an alleged actual equality among humans. - This is incorrect because Singer\u2019s principle is not about describing actual equality among humans.\\n\\nB. a description of an alleged equality among all living beings. - This is incorrect because Singer\u2019s principle is not about describing equality among all living beings.\\n\\nC. a prescription of how we should treat nonhuman animals. - This is partially correct but not comprehensive enough.\\n\\nD. a description of an alleged inequality among all living beings. - This is incorrect because Singer\u2019s principle is not about describing inequality.\\n\\nE. a prescription of how we should treat humans. - This is partially correct but not comprehensive enough.\\n\\nF. a description of an alleged actual inequality among humans. - This is incorrect because Singer\u2019s principle is not about describing actual inequality.\\n\\nG. a description of an alleged actual superiority of humans over nonhuman animals. - This is incorrect because Singer argues against the superiority of humans over nonhuman animals.\\n\\nH. a prescription of how we should treat both human and nonhuman animals equally. - This is correct because it captures the essence of Singer\u2019s principle, which is about giving equal consideration to the interests of all beings capable of suffering.\\n\\nI. a prescription of how we should treat nonhuman animals differently. - This is incorrect because Singer advocates for equal consideration, not different treatment.\\n\\nJ. a prescription of how we should treat the environment. - This is incorrect because Singer\u2019s principle specifically addresses the treatment of beings capable of suffering, not the environment in general.\\n\\nThe best answer is: The answer is H.\\n\\nExplanation: The model incorrectly interpreted the question, focusing on Singer\u2019s broader views on equality for all beings rather than strictly on the equality principle as it applies to humans. The correct answer (E), focusing solely on human beings, was overlooked in favor of a broader interpretation (H).\"}"}
