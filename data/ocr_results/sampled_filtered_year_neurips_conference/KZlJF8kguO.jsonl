Subjects watched on average 2.6 Hollywood movies, for an average viewing time of 4.3 hours, and a total of 43 hours. The audio track for each movie was transcribed with manual corrections. Word onsets were manually annotated on spectrograms of the audio track for each movie. Each transcript was automatically parsed and manually corrected into the universal dependencies (UD) formalism, assigning a part of speech to every word and a dependency parse to every sentence. In total, subjects heard over 38,000 sentences (223,000 words), while they had on average 168 electrodes implanted.

Despite numerous attempts to understand how the brain processes language through investigations of compositionality [1\u20134], semantic categories [5\u20137], and surprisal [8\u201312], a mechanistic understanding is still lacking. Our hypothesis is that this is in part because studies often focus on small data regimes, since gathering large-scale neural recordings is extremely laborious. Yet NLP and ML research in general has shown that scale matters. In particular, even probing experiments on artificial networks require a fairly large scale to produce reliable results, certainly larger than a few hundred sentences [13, 14]. NLP would not have progressed without large-scale resources, so to enable the same kind of progress, we collect a new large-scale neuroscience dataset, which has naturalistic stimuli, is\\n\\n* Equal contribution.

What distinguishes it, is that it is accompanied by both multimodal annotations and by neural recordings collected from 10 subjects who heard 223,068 annotated words while they watched Hollywood films. Subjects watched a total of 26 films (43.5 hours) as data was recorded from a total of 1,688 electrodes. To this, we add manual and automated annotations.\\n\\nScene labels: every scene in the movie was labeled according to the Places365 schema, resulting in 46,935 scenes total.\\n\\nWord onsets and offsets: while automatic speech recognition performs acceptably, errors are common, which were manually corrected. In addition, automated systems are simply not trained to offer extreme accuracy, at the millisecond level, when determining the start and end of words. Word onsets had to be manually annotated on spectrograms for every word to ensure alignment with the neural recordings.\\n\\nPart of speech (POS) tags and parses: sentences were automatically parsed into the Universal Dependencies framework and then each part of speech tag and dependency relationship was manually corrected. While POS tagging is fairly accurate, numerous parser errors existed.\\n\\nSpeaker identity: A unique identifier, which can be traced back to a given character, was given to every speaker in every movie. This was done manually, as no automated system exists to do so with any reasonable accuracy. Finally, we also curated a list of 16 automated video, audio, and language features that we provide to save computing time (see Table 4). We release all our data with a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0) license.\\n\\nLarge scale stimuli for the neuroscience of language and multimodal understanding can enable natural experiments: the kind of post-hoc analysis of large-scale datasets that has propelled NLP and machine learning in general forward. In the long term we hope that treebanks such as ours, coupled with neural recordings, will help the creation of theories of language understanding that span linguistics, neuroscience, and NLP. To demonstrate the utility of the dataset, in addition to providing the raw data, we also take new steps toward understanding language in the brain; our contributions are:\\n\\n1. A dataset of intracranial recordings across 26 different movie viewings (43.5 hours total).\\n2. Localization of electrode positions and alignment with common brain atlases.\\n3. Multiple layers of manual annotations to enable numerous experiments: scene labels, word onsets and offsets, part of speech tags, parses in universal dependencies format, and speaker identity.\\n4. Multiple automated annotations for 16 other language, audio, and visual features.\\n5. Quantitative results that show neural responsiveness to word onset and differential activation based on the position of a word within a sentence.\\n\\n2 Related work\\n\\nPrevious works have studied language processing in the context of Magnetoencephalography (MEG) [17, 18], Electroencephalography (EEG) [19, 20], and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) [21\u201326]. In this work, we present Stereoelectroencephalography (sEEG) data with both high temporal resolution and naturalistic stimuli.\\n\\nRecording the brain's response to naturalistic stimuli is critical to neuroscientific progress [27]. There exist fMRI datasets for naturalistic speech [28\u201330], vision [31, 32], and movies [33, 34]. And similar data has been collected for the EEG modality (speech [35], vision [36], and movies [37]). There are also movie datasets that cover both modalities [38].

All subjects were implanted with intracranial electrodes to localize seizure foci for potential surgical resection. All experiments were approved by BCH/Harvard IRB and were carried out with the subjects' informed consent. IRB documents are available upon request, but are otherwise sensitive. Electrode types, number, and position were driven solely by clinical considerations. Recorded data was anonymized, and identifying patient information was redacted.\\n\\nTask and stimuli\\n\\nStimuli consisted of 21 recent animated/action Hollywood movies; see supplementary Table 3 for per-movie statistics. On average, movies were 2.07 hours long ($\\\\sigma \\\\approx 0.68$) and contained 1,443 sentences ($\\\\sigma \\\\approx 333$), 8,966 total words ($\\\\sigma \\\\approx 2068$), 1,749 unique words ($\\\\sigma \\\\approx 315$), 1,328 unique lemmas ($\\\\sigma \\\\approx 251$), 1,218 nouns ($\\\\sigma \\\\approx 271$), 610 unique nouns ($\\\\sigma \\\\approx 126$), 1,343 verbs ($\\\\sigma \\\\approx 293$), and 508 unique verbs ($\\\\sigma \\\\approx 98$).

For further details, see Appendix A.3.\\n\\nData acquisition and signal processing\\n\\nClinicians implanted subjects with intracranial stereoelectroencephalographic (sEEG) depth probes containing 6-16 0.8 mm diameter 2 mm long contact electrodes recording Intracranial Field Potentials (IFPs). Each subject had multiple (12 to 18) such probes implanted in locations determined by clinical concerns entirely unrelated to the experiment, informed by a functional analysis [45]. The number of electrodes per subject ranged between 106 and 246 ($\\\\mu \\\\approx 167$, $\\\\sigma \\\\approx 38$) for a total of 1,688 total electrodes; see supplementary Table 2 for a per-subject breakdown. Data collected during periods of seizures or immediately following a seizure was discarded. For each electrode, a notch filter was applied at 60 Hz and harmonics before analysis. No other processing (downsampling, filtering specific frequency bands, etc.) was performed on the neural recordings. For further details, see Appendix A.4. Finally, the location of all electrodes was identified and mapped to the common brain atlases (Desikan et al. [46] and Destrieux et al. [47]). For the purposes of region analyses, electrodes in white matter are projected to the grey-white boundary and assigned to the closest atlas region. Region analyses in this paper are given with respect to the Desikan-Killiany atlas. See Appendix A.5 for further details.\\n\\nAudio transcription and alignment\\n\\nFor each movie, the timestamps for all words in the audio were transcribed and timestamps for each word were found programmatically and then manually corrected by trained annotators (see Appendix A.1 for further details). The pipeline developed for this audio transcription and alignment effort is an independently useful source of annotated stimuli, which can now be used for further experiments. We described this pipeline more completely in a separate technical paper: Yaari et al. [48]. Part of speech tags and dependency parses were manually corrected and speaker identity and scene labels were manually annotated from scratch by an in-house expert hired at MIT.\\n\\nFeature annotation\\n\\nTo model the neural responses during the complex movies, we considered a series of 16 features (Table 4). These features include 5 visual attributes (pixel brightness, global optical flow magnitude, optical flow angle, and number of faces, Figure 1d), 4 auditory attributes (volume, pitch, delta volume, and delta pitch, Figure 1e), and 6 language attributes (GPT-2 surprisal, word time length, word time difference, index in sentence, word head, and part of speech tag, Figure 1f-g). All of these features were aligned to and computed for each word. Table 4 provides a brief description of each feature, and their calculation is described in Appendix A.2.\\n\\nAdditionally, scenes and speakers were labeled for each movie. Scenes were extracted based on camera cuts using PySceneDetect [49]. Each scene was labeled based on the corresponding image environment and labels were extracted from the Places365 dataset [15]. Finally, for each sentence in the audio transcript, the speaker identity was manually annotated (see Appendix A.2).\\n\\n4 Quantitative analyses of language function with the dataset\\n\\nWord onsets triggered strong neural responses\\n\\nAfter aligning the neurophysiological data to the occurrence of words (Figure 1a-c), we assessed whether the neural responses were modulated by word onset by comparing the mean activity in 5 pairs of consecutive windows of 100ms duration\"}"}

We defined an electrode to be word-responsive if it yielded a statistically significant difference in at least one of the 5 pairs (paired t-test, p<0.05, Bonferroni corrected, see Appendix A.6). Figure 2a shows the neural responses of an example electrode located in the left superior temporal sulcus (Figure 2a inset). The raster plot (top) and average activity (bottom) show strong activation triggered by the onset of each word. This activity can be readily appreciated for almost every word in the more than 7,000 words (raster plot) of a single movie. Interestingly, the activity of this electrode begins to show a slight deviation from baseline before the onset of words at time 0. The complex nature of natural stimuli like the movie implies that multiple variables could in principle drive the neural responses. Indeed, the responses to individual words in Figure 2a show a strong degree of heterogeneity. To gain insight into what could drive these diverse responses, we considered a set of 16 visual, auditory, and language features (Table 4, Figure 1d-g). We built a Generalized Linear Model (GLM) that included all 16 features. The absolute value of the coefficients for each feature indicated how much each annotation contributed to explaining the neural responses (Figure 2b). For this example electrode, auditory and language features both showed a statistically significant contribution to explaining the neural response. Among the strongest contributors were the four language features shown in Figure 2d-g. The average of all coefficients across the 339 electrodes in the temporal lobe is shown in Figure 2c, for which we note that the features with the highest averaged coefficients were the index in sentence, part of speech, and delta volume (further regions shown in Figure 9).\\n\\nTo better understand the contribution of the language features with the largest coefficients for the example electrodes, we plotted the neural responses for words that had different values for those features. In Figure 2d, we separated the words of a movie into those that appeared early in a sentence (quartile with lowest index in sentence, light gray) and those that appeared late in a sentence (quartile with highest index, dark gray). The average neural responses for this example electrode revealed notable differences between these two groups. Common to both groups, there was a deflection from baseline well before t=0. Words with high indices led to reduced voltages and words with low indices led to high voltages after t=0. In a similar fashion, we observed responses separated by nouns versus verbs (Figure 2e), high and low word length (Figure 2f), and high and low GPT-2 surprisal (Figure 2g). In all of these cases, words elicited neural responses across different features even as the neural responses were modulated by those features. Similar conclusions for this electrode can be drawn when considering auditory (supplementary Figure 8a) or visual features (supplementary Figure 8b).\\n\\nNext, we asked whether the neural responses are due purely to language, and whether an audio and/or visual explanation can be ruled out. Across all electrodes, we found that there exist 244 (\u224816%) electrodes for which there was a significant (p<0.05, Bonferroni corrected) word response, after controlling for all audio and visual features. The fraction of such electrodes per region is shown in Figure 2h and the locations of these electrodes are shown in Figure 2i. Sentence position modulates neural activity\\n\\nThe results for the example electrode in Figure 2d suggest that the position of a word within a sentence can have a strong impact on the neural responses. To systematically evaluate whether neural signals are dependent on word position, we first categorized words according to their linear position (Figure 3a), separating them into sentence onsets, sentence offsets, and sentence midsets, which are the words that occur in between. Figure 3a shows the neural responses from an example electrode located in left superior temporal gyrus. This electrode showed stronger responses to sentence onsets (left) compared to midsets (middle) and offsets (right). These differences were evident even in single words (raster plots, top), as well as in the average responses (bottom) and are summarized in Figure 3b, which shows the mean neural activity for onsets, midsets, and offsets in a 100ms window. Similar to our analysis in the previous section, we evaluated mean neural activity at five evenly spaced 100ms windows, starting from the word onset. The activity shown in Figure 3b was taken from the window with the most significant difference between onset, midset, and offset activity (f-test, p<0.05, Bonferroni corrected). Asterisks in Figure 3b denote the significance of this difference.\\n\\nIt might be the case that sentence onsets could be associated with a confounding feature, such as increased volume. We therefore separately plotted the responses to words in different sentence positions for cases with high and low volume. The strong modulation by part of sentence persisted across different volume levels (Figure 3c-d). Next, in addition to volume, we considered all the 16 features that we annotated in the movie, using a GLM model as illustrated in the previous section. The feature with the third highest coefficient in the GLM model was the index in sentence (Figure 3e). Running the GLM analysis for all electrodes revealed 235 electrodes (\u224815% of total electrodes) for...\"}"}

To that end, we fitted a linear regression for every 250ms interval in a \\\\([-1000ms,1000ms]\\\\) window. As discussed in the previous sections, we had observed language responses to be stronger at sentence onsets, so we first considered the case of trying to decode whether or not a sentence onset was occurring. However, the case for generic word onsets was also considered (see supplementary Figure 6), and is discussed below as well.\\n\\nFor each electrode, we created a training dataset of neural activity (see Appendix A.9). Positive examples consisted of sentence onsets and negative examples were taken from portions of the movie where no dialogue is occurring. We fit a regression on the train data, validate using 5-fold cross validation, and report the ROC-AUC on the test set. Figure 4a. shows the peak decoding performance per electrode. Here, the peak performance is the maximum performance achieved over the course of the entire considered time interval. Figure 4c shows the test-set performance per time interval in the temporal and frontal lobe, averaged across the 10 electrodes that had the highest peak decoding performance on the train set. In the frontal region, decoding peaked later than in the temporal region (300ms vs 100ms). We performed the same decoding for generic word onsets (see Figure 6).\"}"}

Decoding in the temporal lobe reached a peak at 200ms, compared to 300ms in the frontal lobe.\\n\\nFinally, we also attempted to linearly decode the noun vs. verb distinction in the brain (supplementary Figure 7). We saw that the noun vs. verb distinction is most decodable in the frontal lobe, where decoding performance peaks after word onset (t = 400ms).\\n\\n5 Conclusion\\n\\nThe Brain Treebank has a unique combination of large scale, high temporal resolution, high spatial resolution, naturalistic stimuli, and many layers of manual annotation. Because naturalistic stimuli contain many uncontrolled co-occurring features, scale is critical in order to find natural experiments with controls post-hoc. We demonstrate two such an experiments: first, how response to words and sentences can be identified, even after controlling for co-occurring features, and second, how linear decoding reveals the time course of word and sentence processing. This only begins to explore what can be done with these data and annotations, and it remains to be seen what is detectable if more powerful decoding tools are applied.\\n\\nLimitations\\n\\nSubjects only watched each movie once, thus one cannot simply average over repetitions of exactly the same stimulus. Although, each movie does repeat the same words and often shows the same characters, naturalistic stimuli are harder to work with than controlled experiments. Subjects all saw different movies, making the cross-subject analysis more difficult. At the same time, this means that there are more opportunities to find interesting phenomena because of the diversity of the movies that subjects saw. As with all studies that involve naturalistic stimuli, controlling for confounds can be difficult. Intracranial recordings are only possible because subjects require neurosurgery for some condition, in this case epilepsy; it is possible that this could result in some sampling bias.\\n\\nAdditionally, the corpus includes only movies in English, although we are adding Spanish movies and subjects shortly. In this vein, we are actively working on collecting more data and hope that others who intend to collect data can collect it for the movies we have annotated here. Tools and techniques to run experiments on naturalistic data are much newer and more limited at the moment. We have not begun to scratch the surface of the kinds of analyses possible with the Brain Treebank. For example, we have never used the speaker identities and hardly exploited multimodality, nor have we made use of the parses aside from the POS tags. We hope that the Brain Treebank will enable the development of new tools and new kinds of neuroscientific experiments at scale with natural stimuli, as well as bring the neuroscience, NLP, and linguistics communities closer together with a shared resource that has components from each.\\n\\nAcknowledgements\\n\\nWe would like to thank Marcelo Armendariz for his helpful feedback and assistance with software.

A custom tool was developed to refine the alignment via an auditory spectrogram of 4 seconds at a time and slowed-down audio track. Annotators were instructed to adjust the onset and offset of every word to align with the spectrogram and their perception of when the word started and ended. The audio annotation tool automatically played the audio segment corresponding to each word to allow annotators to verify their work. As the audio was played a line marked the location of the audio sample in the spectrogram in real time.\\n\\nSince speech recognizers often misused or missed critical punctuation marks, these were inserted by annotators manually. Sentences were then manually segmented. Annotators were instructed not to use abbreviations, even if they are common. Annotators marked audio segments that consisted of overlapping speech or signing. These were removed from the dataset. All foreign language was marked and removed from the dataset. Annotators were instructed to transcribe literally, i.e., contractions were used in the transcript only when spoken as such. Similarly, foreshortened words, e.g., goin' vs going, were transcribed as such when used by speakers. Cardinal numbers were spelled out. Longer numbers were spelled out as spoken, including conjunctions such as \u201cand\u201d. All overheard words were transcribed, even when they could not easily be localized on the spectrogram, for example, short words such as \u201cto\u201d can sometimes be heard but no specific segment of the spectrogram seems to correspond uniquely to such words. In this case annotators were asked to mark their onset and offset as they heard the words. Transcripts are as spoken, without correction, even when the speaker erred omitting a word or using a word inappropriately.\\n\\nA.2 Feature annotation\\n\\nWe extract 16 features that were included in the analyses (see Supplementary Table 4). Visual and auditory features are computed over a fixed 500ms window after word onset.\\n\\n**Visual features**\\n\\nThe visual scene scalar features were extracted from the middle frame presented during a word utterance via OpenCV 4.4.0 [50]. Brightness was quantified as the average pixel HSV value channel. Flow vectors were computed as dense optical flow over grey-scale frames via the OpenCV `calcOpticalFlowFarneback` function (pyramid scale 0.5, 5 levels, window size 11, 5 iterations, pixel neighborhood of 5, and smoothing of 1.1). Number of faces per-frame was estimated via the OpenCV `CascadeClassifier` function with the Haar cascade frontal face default classifiers over gray-scale frames (scale factor: 1.1, minimum neighbours: 4).\\n\\n**Auditory features**\\n\\nThe auditory scalar features were collected with the Python Librosa package (0.7.2) [51], an open source audio analysis library. Sound intensity and mean frequency of the audio track during word utterance were estimated, as well as their change relatively to the preceding 500 ms window. The average intensity of the audio segment was computed as the root-mean-square (RMS) (`rms` function, frame and hop lengths 2048 and 512 respectively) of that segment. Pitch was extracted using Librosa\u2019s `piptrack` function over a Mel-spectrogram (sampling rate 48,000 Hz, FFT window length of 2048, hop length of 512, and 128 mel filters).\\n\\n**Language features**\\n\\nWe used a state-of-the-art syntactic parser, Stanford NLP Group\u2019s Stanza [52], to parse every sentence. POS tags were recorded for every word. Surprisal was quantified as the negative-log word probability. Word probabilities were estimated by a transformer model. GPT-2 probabilities were computed via GPT-2 large using the Hugging Face Transformers 3.0.0 library [53]. Word particle surprisal were combined by summation.\\n\\nAll Universal Dependency features were inferred using the standard English model of the Stanza Natural Language Processing toolkit [52] and then manually corrected via a single trained annotator over the course of a year.\"}"}

If a character is unnamed, the annotator may identify them with a brief description of their role. Occasionally, a character had another identity that they went by. In Spider-Man: Homecoming, the AI in Peter's suit is known for more than half the movie as \\\"suit lady,\\\" until Peter finally decides to give her the name \\\"Karen.\\\" In such situations, the annotator marked both identities, with whichever identity they decide is primary listed first, and the secondary identity in parentheses. So, in the above example, Peter's AI is annotated as \\\"Karen (suit lady).\\\"\\n\\nBecause of our data set, we deal with quite a lot of superheroes with secret identities. If a superhero was in costume, annotators identified them by their superhero name. Out of costume, they were identified by their birth name. When they are partially in costume (say, they're in costume, but they've taken off their mask), annotators identified them by their superhero name, followed by their birth name, separated by a forward slash: e.g. Spider-Man / Peter Parker.\\n\\nIn situations where one character is pretending to be another, the guidelines bear some resemblance to the guidelines for heroes that are partially in costume. Annotators identified them by the person being imitated, followed by the true identity of the character, separated by a percent symbol. So, for a good part of the movie Megamind, the titular character is pretending to be a museum curator named Bernard. Dialog spoken by him during these moments should be annotated as \\\"Bernard % Megamind.\\\"\\n\\nLines that had problems and therefore that need special attention can be identified using an asterisk. Two of the most common situations where this cropped up were when multiple characters were speaking in unison, or when a \\\"sentence\\\" actually contains utterances from multiple characters. In the former situation, these were identified with the line \\\"* multiple speakers.\\\" In the latter situation, both speakers were annotated, with an asterisk between them e.g. \\\"Peter Parker * Tony Stark,\\\" and an asterisk was added to the line of dialog at the point where one of them stops speaking and the other begins.\\n\\nA.3 Task and stimuli\\n\\nMovies were extracted from DVDs and are unchanged other than being re-encoded to a fixed frame rate (23.976 fps). Transcripts, and all annotations described in this work will be made publicly available. Due to copyrights prohibiting the release of the raw stimuli (movies) source material, multiple audio-visual sample clips and tools allowing users to verify alignment of their own movie copies will be publicly provided.\\n\\nMovies were shown in full to each subject. Movies were displayed via a custom video player created in Matlab 2018b. The player ensured that the presentation was at a fixed frame rate to keep the audio and video synchronized. The presentation of movies was accompanied by regular electrical triggers sent to the neural recording system to enable accurate temporal alignment between the movie and the neural data. A 15.4 inch (resolution 2880\u00d71800) Apple MacBook Pro Retina was placed 60-100cm in front of the subject. Subjects adjusted the volume and paused/resumed the movie as needed. The movie was paused by the experimenter any time someone entered the room or when subjects were distracted and was resumed when subjects could direct their full attention back to the movie. Subjects could freely change position, but were instructed by the experimenter, who watched the movies with the subjects, to remain focused on the stimulus or pause the movie. Subjects did not speak during the presentation of the movie nor did they overhear any other speech other than that found in the movie.\\n\\nA.4 Data acquisition and signal processing\\n\\nClinicians implanted subjects with intracranial stereo-electroencephalographic (sEEG) depth probes containing 6-16 0.8 mm diameter 2 mm long contact electrodes (Ad-Tech, Racine, WI, USA) recording Intracranial Field Potentials (IFPs) with 1.5 mm separation. Each subject had multiple such probes implanted in locations determined by clinical concerns entirely unrelated to the experiment. Data was recorded using XLTEK (Oakville, ON, Canada) and BioLogic (Knoxville, TN, USA) hardware with a sampling rate of 2048 Hz.\\n\\nDuring movie presentation, triggers were sent to a separate channel on the neural recording device via a USB connection to a dedicated trigger box (Measurement Computing USB-1208FS) using the...\"}"}

Each pulse was logged with both its wall-lock timestamp and its movie timestamp. Individual triggers were sent every 100ms. Specific events (movie start, pause, resume, and end) were marked by bursts of triggers (10, 8, 9, and 11 respectively) separated by 15ms. All triggers consisted of a 15ms electrical burst at a magnitude of 80mV. An automated tool found triggers and aligned the movie and neural data.\\n\\nA.5 Cortical surface extraction and electrode visualization\\n\\nFor each subject, pre-operative T1 MRI scans without contrast were processed with FreeSurfer\u2019s recon-all function with -localGI, which performed skull stripping, white matter segmentation, surface generation, and cortical parcellation [54\u201373]. iELVis [74] was used to co-register a post-operative fluoroscopy scan to the preoperative MRI. Electrodes were manually identified using BioImageSuite [75], and then assigned to one of 68 regions (according to the Desikan-Killiany atlas [46]) using FreeSurfer\u2019s automatic parcellation. The alignment to the atlas was manually verified for each subject. One subject (subject 5) had a large frontal lesion in the right hemisphere that prevented alignment to an atlas. Electrodes from this subject were included in all analyses except for region analyses and they were not plotted on the brain.\\n\\nCorrupted signal electrodes (n = 114) with extensive durations of static signal recordings were manually removed from consideration prior to any downstream analysis. When determining significance, Bonferonni correction was done according to the remaining number of electrodes.\\n\\nDepth electrodes in the white matter were projected to the nearest point on that boundary, and were labeled as coming from that region (for the purposes of region significance analyses). Of the 1,688 total electrodes, 1,504 of the electrodes were able to placed in this way into a particular region. The relevant region analyses are shown in Figure 2h-i, Figure 3f-h, Figure 15e-f, Figure 4b, Figure 6b, Figure 7b, Figure 10e.\\n\\nThis procedure is very similar to the post brain-shift correction methods used for electrocorticography electrodes [76]. For visualization purposes, all electrodes identified to lie in the gray matter or on the gray-white matter boundary were first projected to the pial surface (using nearest neighbors), and then mapped to an average brain (using Freesurfer\u2019s fsaverage atlas) for the visualizations shown in the main text.\\n\\nExample electrodes\\n\\nThe electrode shown in Figure 2 is LT1bIb6 from Subject 2. The electrode shown in Figure 3 is T1b2 from Subject 3. The electrode shown in Figure 4 is T1cIf8 from Subject 10. The electrode shown in supplementary Figure 15 is T1bIc6 from Subject 1.\\n\\nA.6 Word responsiveness\\n\\nTo determine the word responsiveness of an electrode, we compared pre-onset windows to post-onset windows (Figure 13). Precisely, we compared the mean activity in a 100ms window before word onset to the activity in a 100ms window after word onset with a two-tailed paired t-test. The windows were separated by an interval of 1s. This test was performed for absolute offsets of [\u22120.5s, \u22120.4s, \u22120.3s, \u22120.2s, \u22120.1s] (Figure 13). This is done to account for the fact that any one offset may \u201cmiss\u201d the neural response by chance (see Figure 13). An electrode is word responsive if at least one of the tests shows a significant (after correction for multiple comparisons) difference between pre- and post-onset activity. In such cases, we report the significance of the t-test with the lowest p-value.\\n\\nA.7 Testing difference between conditions\\n\\nWhen determining the significance of the difference between two conditions (Figure 2c, Figure 3b, Figure 15a,c,d), we used a two-tailed t-test to compare the mean activity in a 100ms window for the two conditions. Five t-tests are performed, at absolute offsets of [0s, 0.1s, 0.2s, 0.3s, 0.4s] and we say that the two conditions result in different neural responses if there exists a test for which there is a significant difference, after correction for multiple comparisons. In such cases, we report the significance of the tests with the lowest p-value. As in the above section, this is done to account for the fact that any one of the tests may miss the difference between the two conditions by chance.\"}"}

The input dataset consisted of a feature vector for each word (token) in the movies that the subject watched. The feature vector consisted of the 16 visual, auditory, and language features listed in Table 4 that co-occurred with each word. All features were normalized across the movie in which they occurred. The target was the mean neural response in a 500ms window after word onset. For subjects that watched many movies, linear mixed effect modeling was used, where the movie was taken to be a random effect.\\n\\nA.9 Linear decoding\\n\\nModel\\n\\nThe model is a logistic regression.\\n\\nData pre-processing\\n\\nNeural data is decimated by a factor of 10. Data is normalized to 0 mean and unit standard deviation. Normalization is done such that no data-leakage occurs (see below).\\n\\nDataset\\n\\nThe sentence-onset decoding task requires the model to distinguish between neural activity from an interval in the movie during which a sentence is beginning versus an interval during which no speech is occurring. To obtain positive examples, for every sentence onset, we extract 2s of neural activity, centered on the sentence onset. To obtain negative examples, we divide the movies into 3s segments, and filter for segments that do not overlap with any speech time-stamps. The size of 3s guarantees that there is at least a 500ms buffer between every positive example and every negative example (see below). The dataset is balanced so that an equal number of negative and positive examples occur. Data is drawn from all recorded movies per subject.\\n\\nTraining\\n\\nWe are interested in answering the question, how does decodability vary across time? To this end, we divide each example into 250ms intervals. Per each time interval, per electrode, we fit a regression. Training was done on a single NVIDIA Titan RTXs (24GB GPU Ram) with 80 CPU cores.\\n\\nEvaluation\\n\\nPer electrode, we create an 80/20 train/test split. The model performance is reported on the test set. Train/test splits are shared between electrodes in the same subject. In Figure 4b-c and supplementary Figure 5, we select the top 10 electrodes with the highest score on the train-set (5-fold cross-validation) per region, and report the performance of these electrodes on the test set. The same is done in supplementary Figure 6b,d-e and supplementary Figure 7b,d-e.\"}"}

Indeed, the two word classes, nouns and verbs, are widely recognized to be among the few linguistic universals [78, 79]. Part-of-speech was a significant predictor in the example electrodes shown in Figure 2 and Figure 3. Given their importance in language, we directly compared the responses to nouns versus verbs (Figure 15). Figure 15a shows the responses of an example electrode located in the left superior temporal gyrus (inset) which showed stronger responses to verbs compared to nouns.\\n\\nThe GLM analysis showed that there were no electrodes which exhibited activity exclusively modulated by part-of-speech. Instead, the neural activity was captured by multiple features as shown in the previous examples. Figure 15b shows that the main feature for this electrode is the index in sentence, followed by the part-of-speech and volume. Indeed, after separating the responses according to the position in the sentence, there was a small but significant difference between nouns and verbs for sentence offsets but not for sentence midsets and onsets (Figure 15c). The differences between nouns and verbs persisted across high and low volumes (Figure 15d). There were no electrodes for which a difference in part-of-speech was observed across all sub-samplings for all features. But there were 69 electheretrodes for which part of speech has a significant ($p < 0.05, \\\\text{Bonferroni corrected}$) beta coefficient in the GLM analysis. Figure 15e shows the exact location of these electrodes and Figure 15f shows the fraction, per region, of the part of speech significant electrodes. We also found that the noun-verb distinction is linearly decodable (see Figure 7), with significant decoding performance distributed across the brain (Figure 7a), and with the highest decoding performance observed in the frontal lobe and cingulate (Figure 7b-e).\\n\\nFinally, we observed a difference in the magnitude and timing of the peak neural response between nouns and verbs (Figure 17). For each electrode, we computed the mean of the neural response, averaged across all words. Restricting our attention to those electrodes which show at least a moderate neural response (Cohen's $d > 0.1$), we can compute the peak of that mean response (Figure 17b) and observe that it is lower in the case of verbs at sentence onsets ($\\\\mu \\\\approx 32.8, \\\\sigma = 26.7 \\\\mu V$ for verbs, $\\\\mu \\\\approx 36.7, \\\\sigma = 29.4 \\\\mu V$ for nouns), but higher in the case of verb midsets ($\\\\mu = 33.4, \\\\sigma = 23.7 \\\\mu V$ for verbs, $\\\\mu = 31.6, \\\\sigma = 25.1 \\\\mu V$ for nouns). We also find the timing (Figure 17c) of the sentence midset peaks and observe that it is later in the case of verbs ($\\\\mu \\\\approx 188, \\\\sigma = 313$ ms for verbs, $\\\\mu \\\\approx 77, \\\\sigma = 360$ ms for nouns).\"}"}

Note that we do not believe this result stands in opposition to previous findings, such as in [80], foremost because we consider a much different distribution of sentences in our work.
