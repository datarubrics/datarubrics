Was there a specific task in mind? Was there a specific gap that needed to be filled? Please provide a description.\\n\\nRWKU is a real-world knowledge unlearning benchmark specifically designed for large language models (LLMs). RWKU is designed based on the following three key factors:\\n\\n1. For the task setting, we consider a more practical and challenging setting, similar to \u201czero-shot knowledge unlearning\u201d. We provide only the unlearning target and the original model, without offering any forget corpus or retain corpus. In this way, it avoids secondary information leakage caused by the forget corpus and is not affected by the distribution bias of the retain corpus.\\n\\n2. For the knowledge source, we choose real-world famous people from Wikipedia as the unlearning targets and demonstrate that such popular knowledge is widely present in various LLMs through memorization quantification, making it more suitable for knowledge unlearning. Additionally, choosing entities as unlearning targets can well clearly define the unlearning boundaries.\\n\\n3. For the evaluation framework, we carefully design the forget set and the retain set to evaluate the model\u2019s capabilities from multiple real-world applications. Regarding the forget set, we evaluate the efficacy of knowledge unlearning at both the knowledge memorization (fill-in-the-blank style) and knowledge manipulation (question-answer style) abilities. Specifically, we also evaluate these two abilities through adversarial attacks to induce forgotten knowledge in the model. We adopt four membership inference attack (MIA) methods for knowledge memorization on our collected MIA set. We meticulously designed nine types of adversarial-attack probes for knowledge manipulation, including prefix injection, affirmative suffix, role playing, reverse query, and others. Regarding the retain set, we design a neighbor set to test the impact of neighbor perturbation, specifically focusing on the locality of unlearning. In addition, we assess the model utility on various capabilities, including general ability, reasoning ability, truthfulness, factuality, and fluency.\\n\\n\u2022 Who created the dataset (e.g., which team, research group) and on behalf of which entity (e.g., company, institution, organization)?\\n\\nThe author team created the dataset.\\n\\nA.2 Composition\\n\\n\u2022 What do the instances that comprise the dataset represent (e.g., documents, photos, people, countries)? Are there multiple types of instances (e.g., movies, users, and ratings; people and interactions between them; nodes and edges)? Please provide a description.\\n\\nWe select 200 famous people from The Most Famous All-time People Rank as our unlearning targets.\\n\\n\u2022 How many instances are there in total (of each type, if appropriate)?\\n\\nRWKU mainly consists of four subsets, including the forget set, the neighbor set, the MIA set, and the utility set. The forget set, the neighbor set, and the MIA set are constructed in this paper. We list the dataset snapshot below:\\n\\n| Set           | Dataset Size | Number of Instances | Average Length |\\n|---------------|--------------|---------------------|----------------|\\n| Forget FB     | 700          | 3,268               | 12.7           |\\n| Forget QA     | 635          | 2,879               | 11.1           |\\n| Forget AA     | 1,913        | 6,984               | 19.5           |\\n| Neighbor FB   | 1,542        | 5,846               | 14.6           |\\n| Neighbor QA   | 1,414        | 5,533               | 10.5           |\\n| MIA Set       | 5,699        | 6,198               | 139.9          |\\n| RM            | 6,545        | 7,487               | 131.9          |\\n\\n20\"}"}

If so, please describe how this representativeness was validated/verified. If it is not representative of the larger set, please describe why not (e.g., to cover a more diverse range of instances, because instances were withheld or unavailable).\\n\\nWe sample the utility set from several widely used datasets. For an unlearning target, we sample 171 instances from MMLU [20], 81 instances from BBH [57], 50 instances from TruthfulQA [33], 100 instances from TriviaQA [27], 50 instances from AlpacaEval [31].\\n\\nWhat data does each instance consist of? \u201cRaw\u201d data (e.g., unprocessed text or images) or features?

If the data was reported by subjects or indirectly inferred/derived from other data, was the data validated/verified? If so, please describe how.\\n\\nAll the forget and neighbor probes are generated by GPT-4.\\n\\nWhat mechanisms or procedures were used to collect the data (e.g., hardware apparatus or sensors, manual human curation, software programs, software APIs)? How were these mechanisms or procedures validated?\\n\\nTo construct the probes, we first use GPT-4 API with temperature = 1 to generate an excess of query-answer pairs related to the unlearning targets. Then, we filter these queries using mainstream open-source models to ensure that the knowledge is already present in these models. Finally, we manually check these probes to ensure their format and type are correct.\\n\\nThe process of dataset collection is shown in Figure 6.\\n\\nIf the dataset is a sample from a larger set, what was the sampling strategy (e.g., deterministic, probabilistic with specific sampling probabilities)?\\n\\nWe adopt the random sampling strategy.\\n\\nWho was involved in the data collection process (e.g., students, crowdworkers, contractors) and how were they compensated (e.g., how much were crowdworkers paid)?\\n\\nStudents.\"}"}

The reason we selected entities as the targets for unlearning is because their associated factual knowledge has garnered significant attention and exploration in current research, especially in fields like knowledge probing and knowledge editing. Our main focus is to introduce a novel perspective for LLM knowledge unlearning and to provide a comprehensive evaluation framework to aid in the development of unlearning methods. Currently, we are also striving to diversify the knowledge sources of our unlearning targets. We have collected 100 real-world historical events as unlearning targets, and these will be open-sourced in the future. Additionally, we plan to explore using conceptual knowledge and rule-based knowledge as unlearning targets.\\n\\nC.2 Potential Impact and Ethics Statement\\nIn this paper, we choose 200 famous people as the unlearning targets and construct multi-level knowledge probes to evaluate the model\u2019s memory retention of knowledge. The information about the famous people involved in RWKU is widely available and publicly accessible on Wikipedia, thus RWKU does not raise any privacy concerns. Furthermore, the primary aim of our study is to unlearn specific knowledge, which can effectively eradicate sensitive information, copyrighted data, and potentially harmful capabilities within LLMs. In addition, we design adversarial attack probes to evaluate the robustness of the model after unlearning. We have also taken into account the potential side effects of unlearning. Our aspiration is that RWKU will advance the field of LLM unlearning methods, thereby addressing the ethical concerns surrounding LLMs.\"}"}

However, this capability is dual-use, potentially leading to privacy problems, copyright concerns, and harmful issues [45; 28]. For instance, LLMs may memorize personally identifiable information (e.g., social security numbers) or copyrighted material (e.g., Harry Potter series) from the training data, and emit it verbatim when prompted with adversarial attacks [10]. Besides, AI assistants for biology could troubleshoot bottlenecks in biological weapons development, increasing the risk of such attempts. According to regulations such as the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) upholding individuals\u2019 \u201cright to be forgotten\u201d (RTBF) [41], sensitive and toxic knowledge within LLMs should also be erasable. A straightforward solution is to retrain the model from scratch, ensuring it excludes any data that users have requested to be removed. However, this is not feasible for LLMs that consume extensive computational resources.\\n\\n* Corresponding author.\"}"}

An optimal unlearning method needs to satisfy the following criteria: completely forget the target knowledge, maintain the utility for downstream applications effectively, and accomplish the unlearning process efficiently. Recent works have proposed several techniques to enable LLMs to forget specific knowledge by fine-tuning on the data that needs to be unlearned. Although unlearning is a promising direction, there is a significant lack of comprehensive benchmarks and datasets for evaluating real-world knowledge unlearning. Designing a benchmark for real-world knowledge unlearning requires consideration of the following three key factors:\\n\\n**Task Setting.** The task setting for unlearning should be practical to real-world scenarios. Existing unlearning methods rely on fine-tuning the model on the forget corpus (i.e., a subset of the pre-training corpus). However, such a simplified task setting may not be feasible in real-world scenarios. On one hand, providing sensitive or copyrighted data to the model during the unlearning process can lead to secondary information leakage. Additionally, the pre-training corpus of most open-source LLMs is also inaccessible. On the other hand, during the model\u2019s pre-training process, the memory of a piece of parameterized knowledge may originate from multiple training points. Therefore, finding all the training points corresponding to this knowledge is like searching for a needle in a haystack.\\n\\n**Knowledge Source.** The target to be unlearned should come from real-world knowledge sources. Different from the fictitious unlearning task [39], we need to ensure that the knowledge to be forgotten should originally exist within various LLMs, without the need first to fine-tune the model with this knowledge. This affirms a more realistic unlearning process. Moreover, compared to forgetting a certain ability (e.g., hazardous knowledge) [30], the boundaries of knowledge to be forgotten should be clear, ensuring that the unlearning process is precise and the evaluation result is reliable.\\n\\n**Evaluation Framework.** Evaluating the model after unlearning requires considering the impact on real-world downstream applications. Current benchmarks for assessing the efficacy of unlearning are non-adversarial, simply using multiple-choice or question-answer formats. However, malicious users may use jailbreak techniques [38] to induce the model to generate knowledge that has been deleted. Therefore, it is necessary to assess the model after unlearning under adversarial-attack probes. We should also consider the side effects on the model\u2019s original capabilities, particularly the neighboring knowledge that is closely related to the unlearning target. This requires the unlearning method to accurately delineate the scope of forgetting. Additionally, we should thoroughly evaluate the impact on the model\u2019s general and reasoning capabilities. Since unlearning essentially negates the knowledge originally acquired by the model, we should also assess its effects on truthfulness and factuality.\\n\\nIn this paper, we propose a Real-World Knowledge Unlearning benchmark (RWKU). RWKU is designed based on the three key factors mentioned above: (1) For the task setting, we consider a more practical and challenging setting, similar to \u201czero-shot knowledge unlearning\u201d. We provide only the unlearning target and the original model, without offering any forget corpus or retain corpus. In this way, it avoids secondary information leakage caused by the forget corpus and is not affected by the distribution bias of the retain corpus. (2) For the knowledge source, we choose real-world famous people from Wikipedia as the unlearning targets and demonstrate that such popular knowledge is widely present in various LLMs through memorization quantification, making it more suitable for knowledge unlearning. Additionally, choosing entities as unlearning targets can well clearly define the unlearning boundaries. (3) For the evaluation framework, we carefully design the forget set and the retain set to evaluate the model\u2019s capabilities from multiple real-world applications. Regarding the forget set, we evaluate the efficacy of knowledge unlearning at both the knowledge memorization (fill-in-the-blank style) and knowledge manipulation (question-answer style) abilities. Specifically, we also evaluate these two abilities through adversarial attacks to induce forgotten knowledge in the model. We adopt four membership inference attack (MIA) methods for knowledge memorization on our collected MIA set. We meticulously designed nine types of adversarial-attack probes for knowledge manipulation, including prefix injection, affirmative suffix, role playing, reverse query, and others. Regarding the retain set, we design a neighbor set to test the impact of neighbor perturbation, specifically focusing on the locality of unlearning. In addition, we assess the model utility on various capabilities, including general ability, reasoning ability, truthfulness, factuality, and fluency.\\n\\nIn detail, RWKU contains 200 real-world unlearning targets and 13,131 multi-level forget probes, including 3,268 fill-in-the-blank probes, 2,879 question-answer probes, and 6,984 adversarial-attack probes. To construct the forget probes, we first use GPT-4 [44] to generate an excess of query-answer pairs related to the unlearning targets. Then, we filter these queries using mainstream open-source...\"}"}

Finally, we manually check these probes to ensure their format and type are correct. Similarly, we construct the neighbor set to test the perturbation of neighboring knowledge, which includes 11,379 neighbor probes.\\n\\nBased on the RWKU benchmark, we conduct extensive experiments across two unlearning scenarios (single-target and batch-target unlearning), two models (LLaMA3 [2] and Phi-3 [1]) and six baseline methods. Our experimental results reveal the following findings: (1) Compared to question-answer probes, models after unlearning is more susceptible to adversarial-attack probes and fill-in-the-blank probes, which can induce them to reveal knowledge that appears to have been removed. Additionally, these methods seem to be ineffective against MIAs. (2) It is challenging to balance the unlearning efficacy and locality. While unlearning the target knowledge, there are also side effects on neighboring knowledge. Meanwhile, unlearning can also affect model utility, such as truthfulness and fluency. (3) Batch-target unlearning is significantly more challenging than single-target unlearning and can potentially lead to model collapse. (4) Among all the baseline methods, the classic gradient ascent [25], the recent negative preference optimization [70], and a simple in-context unlearning method perform relatively well. This highlights the need for further research and indicates significant room for improvement on this benchmark. In summary, our key contributions are as follows: (1) We introduce the Real-World Knowledge Unlearning benchmark (RWKU), which contains 200 real-world unlearning targets, 13,131 forget probes, and 11,379 neighbor probes. We consider a more practical and challenging setting, where neither the forget corpus nor the retain corpus is accessible.

For the retain set, we assess locality and utility in terms of neighbor perturbation, general ability, reasoning ability, truthfulness, factuality, and fluency. (3) We conduct extensive experiments across two unlearning scenarios, two models and six baseline methods. From the experimental results, we observe several interesting findings that highlight the need for further research and indicate significant room for improvement on this benchmark. (4) Beyond knowledge unlearning, our benchmark could also contribute to research in knowledge probing, knowledge localization, and model jailbreak. To enable further research, we release our datasets and code publicly at http://rwku-bench.github.io.\\n\\n2 Related Work\\n2.1 Knowledge Unlearning for Large Language Models\\n\\nMachine unlearning [9; 8] focuses on effectively removing specific memorized content from trained machine-learning models to ensure the right to be forgotten. In the field of computer vision, machine unlearning has been extensively studied [17; 18; 19; 29; 61], primarily focusing on the removal of specific training samples in classification tasks. However, this may not be sufficient for generative LLMs, considering their vast parametric knowledge and the interwoven capabilities they possess. Recently, there has been increasing attention on how to perform knowledge unlearning on LLMs [25; 13; 64; 63; 49; 7; 34; 39; 35; 43; 67]. From the perspective of knowledge sources, existing work primarily focuses on forgetting specific classification tasks [ 11; 47], memorized sequences [25; 4], copyrighted books [64; 13], and toxic capacities [37; 5; 30; 22]. Most unlearning methods rely on fine-tuning the model on the forget corpus, such as applying gradient ascent (GA) on the loss [25; 39]. Recently, there have been complementary methods to GA that adopt preference optimization [70], representation controlling [30], and rejection tuning [24] to unlearn the model. Moreover, task arithmetic (TA) is also an unlearning method, enabling efficient model editing through parameter merging [23; 22]. Although unlearning methods for large language models have rapidly developed, some studies [ 46; 36; 38; 54] have shown that it remains easy to extract supposedly forgotten knowledge from the models after unlearning. Therefore, there remains significant room for research on unlearning methods.\"}"}

The goal of WHP is to make it difficult for the unlearning model to generate content related to Harry Potter. WHP collects 300 prompts related to the Harry Potter universe as the forget set, and adopts some common datasets (such as Winogrande [52] and Hellaswag [68]) as the retain set. Li et al. [30] propose a Weapons of Mass Destruction Proxy Benchmark (WMDP), which requires unlearning methods to remove hazardous knowledge in biosecurity and cybersecurity. WMDP collects relevant papers from PubMed and documents from GitHub as the forget corpus and adopts Wikitext as the retain corpus. To evaluate the unlearning efficacy of hazardous capabilities, WMDP provides 4,157 expert-written multiple-choice questions as the forget set. For the retain set, WMDP uses MMLU [20] to evaluate the preservation of general knowledge and MT-Bench [72] to evaluate the fluency. Maini et al. [39] propose a task of fictitious unlearning (TOFU), which contains 200 fictitious authors with question-answer pairs synthesized by GPT-4. Different from previous unlearning datasets, TOFU first fine-tunes the model on the synthetic QA pairs to ensure that the model possesses this knowledge. During the unlearning process, TOFU selects a subset of QA pairs as the forget set and uses another subset of QA pairs as the retain set. Besides, TOFU also evaluates the model utility on Real Authors and World Facts. The detailed comparison between these benchmarks and RWKU is shown in Table 3.\\n\\n3 The RWKU Benchmark\\n\\n3.1 Task Definition and Setting\\n\\nFormally, given an unlearning target, a model $g_\\\\theta$ with parameters $\\\\theta$ is updated with a certain unlearning method, which results in an unlearned model with new parameters $\\\\theta'$. Traditional unlearning tasks [25; 30; 39; 70], usually provide a forget corpus $C_f \\\\in C$, which is typically a subset of the pre-training corpus $C$ that contains the content to be forgotten. Unlearning methods aim to fine-tune the model to make it behave like the model trained only on $C \\\\setminus C_f$. Moreover, some tasks also collect a retain corpus $C_r \\\\in C \\\\setminus C_f$ to maintain the original general capabilities. However, existing methods make strong assumptions about the unlearning setting that simplifies the task considerably [14; 15]. Regarding the forget corpus $C_f$, it may contain private and copyrighted data. Providing $C_f$ to the model again during the unlearning process could result in secondary information leakage. Moreover, during the model's pre-training process, the memory of a specific piece of parameterized knowledge may be derived from multiple training points. Consequently, identifying all the training points corresponding to this knowledge is akin to searching for a needle in a haystack. For the retain corpus $C_r$, considering the efficiency of unlearning, it is typically a very small subset. Its selection is crucial because any deviation from the distribution of the corpus $C$ can potentially affect the model's performance. Therefore, we consider a more practical and challenging setting in the RWKU benchmark: a novel zero-shot knowledge unlearning scenario for LLMs. We provide only the unlearning target $t$ and the original model $g_\\\\theta$, without offering any forget corpus $C_f$ or retain corpus $C_r$. Meanwhile, we also propose an effective solution for this novel task setting. Considering the powerful generative capabilities of LLMs, we can have the original model $g_\\\\theta$ first generate texts related to the unlearning targets to serve as a synthetic forget corpus $C_s_f$, then apply existing unlearning methods to $C_s_f$.\\n\\n3.2 Data Collection and Construction\\n\\nKnowledge Source. A general unlearning benchmark should be applicable to various mainstream open-source LLMs. This means ensuring that the knowledge to be forgotten is widely present in these models. Therefore, we choose famous people as the unlearning targets, requiring the unlearning method to erase factual knowledge about the targets from the model without affecting the neighbor knowledge. To collect the unlearning targets, we first scrape a list of famous people from The Most Famous All-time People Rank 1. Then, we link these entities to Wikipedia and query the Wikipedia page views as a measure of entity popularity [40]. By sorting the entities based on their popularity, we select the top 200 most popular entities as the unlearning targets.\\n\\nMemorization Quantification. To further validate our collected unlearning targets, we quantify the memorization of various LLMs regarding knowledge from different sources. We adopt exact 4\"}"}

Our findings show that for most categories, the questions are indeed diverse. For the correctness, we conduct a random sampling evaluation of 1,000 questions about each unlearning target from their Wikipedia pages and then prompt GPT-4 to generate query-based manipulation and adversarial attack probes, we provide detailed prompt templates in Appendix E.1.\\n\\nTo construct the forget probes, we first use GPT-4 Turbo to generate an excess of topics. We list the top 15 manually annotated cluster categories in Table 4, which are ranked closely related to but not entirely contained within the unlearning targets. For each unlearning target, we consider the hyperlinks on its Wikipedia page as related entities. We then filter these related entities based on their popularity and GPT-4 analysis to obtain the neighboring knowledge. Finally, we manually verify these probes to ensure their format and type are correct, particularly focusing on adversarial attack types.\\n\\nThe results of memorization quantification reveal that the memorization quality varies significantly across different knowledge sources, as shown in Table 5, these knowledge points are meaningful entities rather than simple nouns.\\n\\nWe choose four different knowledge sources: (1) RWKU Knowledge: relevant descriptions from the latest low-popularity Wikipedia pages [40]. (2) Unseen Knowledge: relevant descriptions from the latest Wikipedia pages [51]. As shown in Figure 1, RWKU Knowledge achieves better memorization performance across Phi-2, LLaMA2, and LLaMA3.

Knowledge memorization aims to measure the model\u2019s ability to recall knowledge fragments seen during the training stage. Knowledge manipulation focuses on evaluating the model\u2019s ability to use acquired knowledge to complete downstream tasks. Compared with knowledge memorization, knowledge manipulation is a higher-level and more commonly used ability. Moreover, we also evaluate these two abilities through adversarial attacks to induce forgotten knowledge in the unlearned model.\\n\\nKnowledge Memorization.\\n\\nWe use fill-in-the-blank style probes (FB) to examine the memory of the original training data related to the unlearning targets. We extract some sentences from the Wikipedia page of the unlearning target, replace knowledge points with \u201c____\u201d, and ask the model to complete the blanks. We use the ROUGE-L recall score to measure the relevance between the model\u2019s predictions and the ground truth answers. For unlearning efficacy, lower scores are better.\\n\\nTo rigorously audit whether the model still retains the target knowledge, we employ membership inference attacks (MIAs), which have been used for privacy auditing and investigating copyright violations. MIAs attempt to infer whether a particular input is a member of the model\u2019s training data. We collect some knowledge fragments about the unlearning target as the forget member set (FM). For comparison, we also sample some unrelated knowledge fragments as the retain member set (RM). We provide four MIA methods, including LOSS, Zlib Entropy, Min-K% Prob, and Min-K%++ Prob in RWKU. In our experiments, we primarily report the LOSS scores. Higher scores indicate a lower likelihood that the model retains the specific knowledge. Therefore, a well-learned model should exhibit significantly higher LOSS scores on the FM compared to the RM.\\n\\nKnowledge Manipulation.\\n\\nWe adopt question-answer style probes (QA) to assess the ability of the unlearned model to utilize knowledge in practical applications.

When evaluating the unlearned model, we should also consider the side effects on the model's original capabilities. We conduct the retain assessment from two perspectives: (1) Locality: The unlearning process should be precise, without exceeding the boundaries of the target knowledge and perturbing the surrounding neighboring knowledge. (2) Model Utility: Beyond neighboring knowledge, the model's performance on various real-world applications should not be impacted.\\n\\nNeighbor Perturbation. We define neighboring knowledge in the unlearning task as that which is closely related to, but not entirely contained within the scope of the unlearning targets.

For evaluating unlearning locality, higher scores are better.\\n\\nModel Utility. We assess the model utility on various capabilities, which are detailed as follows:\\n\\n1. General Ability (Gen): We use MMLU [20], which consists of multiple-choice questions from various branches of knowledge. We report 5-shot accuracy based on answer perplexity;\\n2. Reasoning Ability (Rea): We use Big-Bench-Hard (BBH) [57] with 27 subtasks. The evaluation uses chain-of-thought prompts with 3-shot examples, and EM scores are reported;\\n3. Truthfulness (Tru): To evaluate whether the model becomes dishonest after unlearning, we use the TruthfulQA's MC1 task [33], and 6-shot accuracy scores are reported;\\n4. Factuality (Fac): Considering unlearning negates the original knowledge acquired by the model, we evaluate the factuality on TriviaQA [27] with 6-shot, and F1 scores are reported;\\n5. Fluency (Flu): To measure the generation quality of models, we adopt the instructions in AlpacaEval [31], and report the weighted average of bi- and tri-gram entropies [71; 42].\\n\\nFor all the above datasets, higher scores are better. For better reproducibility, we provide detailed evaluation prompts and dataset statistics in Appendix F.1 and F.2.\\n\\n4 Experimental Setup\\n\\n4.1 Model and Data Preparation. We conduct unlearning experiments on LLaMA3-Instruct (8B) and Phi-3 Mini-4K-Instruct (3.8B). As shown in Table 8, we also report the original performance of LLaMA2-Chat (7B) and Mistral-Instruct-v0.2 (7B) for reference. Because most existing unlearning methods for LLMs rely on fine-tuning with the forget corpus $C_f$, they may not be directly applicable to our novel task setting. To address this, we propose a simple and effective solution for this novel task setting. Specifically, we prompt the original model to generate text descriptions related to the unlearning targets, which can serve as the synthetic forget corpus $C_s$. The specific prompt and generated data examples are presented in Appendix G.1 and G.3. For comparison, we also provide the text descriptions from the corresponding Wikipedia pages of each unlearning target as the pseudo ground-truth forget corpus $C^\\\\ast$. \\n\\n4.2 Baseline Methods (1) In-Context Unlearning (ICU) [47]: We use specific instructions to make the model behave as if it has forgotten the target knowledge, without actually modifying the model parameters.\"}"}

Compared to DPO, NPO retains only the negative examples without any positive examples.\\n\\nFirst, we have the model generate some questions related to the unlearning targets, then replace its responses with \\\"I do not know the answer.\\\" Then, we use this refusal data to fine-tune the model so that it can reject questions related to the target.\\n\\nWe train the models using three approaches: full fine-tuning, partial-layer fine-tuning and LoRA. The main experiment adopts the single-target unlearning setting, where one target is forgotten at a time, and the results are averaged over 100 unlearning targets. We provide all the implementation details and hyper-parameter settings in Appendix H.\\n\\n### Table 1: Results of our main experiment on LLaMA3-Instruct (8B)\\n\\nThe best results are highlighted in bold, and the second-best results are in underlined. * denotes the method trained on the pseudo ground truth forget corpus.\\n\\n| Method      | Forget Set \u2193 | Neighbor Set \u2191 | MIA Set \u2193 | Utility Set \u2191 |\\n|-------------|--------------|---------------|-----------|--------------|\\n| FB QA AA All | 85.9 76.4 77.7 79.6 | 95.6 85.3 90.7 | 226.7 230.4 | 65.7 42.3 36.8 53.5 705.8 |\\n| ICU         | 26.2 1.9 10.3 12.8 | 65.0 46.5 55.7 | 247.1 258.4 | 63.6 39.3 36.4 48.2 705.0 |\\n| RepE        | 29.8 33.6 37.8 34.8 | 46.2 38.8 42.6 | 292.0 290.0 | 64.8 26.3 37.6 17.9 703.7 |\\n| GA* (Full)  | 40.7 36.5 43.7 41.4 | 68.6 68.6 68.1 | 1640.9    | 766.2 65.5 39.7 37.8 41.9 692.4 |\\n| GA* (LoRA)  | 70.3 65.6 67.8 68.2 | 80.6 75.5 77.5 | 879.5     | 665.1 64.0 37.8 37.3 43.8 711.3 |\\n| GA (Full)   | 39.1 31.6 46.7 41.9 | 84.6 73.6 79.0 | 258.6 231.0 | 64.9 42.0 35.9 52.5 705.1 |\\n| GA (LoRA)   | 67.0 53.2 61.8 61.3 | 90.1           | 224.1 221.6 | 64.7 41.5 36.6 52.8 697.3 |\\n| DPO (Full)  | 46.3 38.5 41.6 41.9 | 59.2 51.3 55.2 | 243.6 240.8 | 64.1 42.0 31.5 25.8 725.9 |\\n| DPO (LoRA)  | 75.3 65.4 68.6 69.5 | 90.0 81.5       | 228.0 231.2 | 65.6 42.0 34.5 55.5 702.7 |\\n| NPO (Full)  | 33.4 21.0 24.8 26.2 | 76.0 69.9 72.6 | 278.9 263.2 | 64.8 41.5 34.9 41.2 712.2 |\\n| NPO (LoRA)  | 75.1 64.3 69.0 69.7 | 91.3 82.2 86.7 | 225.1 227.0 | 64.9 41.7 36.0 54.0 707.3 |\\n| RT (Full)   | 72.7 13.4 22.8 33.1 | 86.9 45.6 67.4 | 222.7 226.6 | 65.4 41.4 34.9 59.3 588.1 |\\n| RT (LoRA)   | 85.4 49.6 53.2 60.5 | 87.3 74.1 81.9 | 226.0 223.9 | 64.5 41.2 33.6 58.2 667.7 |\\n\\n### Results\\n\\n**Overall Results.** Table 1 and Table 7 present the main experimental results of various unlearning methods on LLaMA3 and Phi-3, respectively. We can find the following conclusions:\\n\\n1. Compared to question-answer probes, models after unlearning is more susceptible to fill-in-the-blank probes and adversarial-attack probes. It implies that although the unlearned model (especially after RT) may forget how to utilize the knowledge, it can still be detected through knowledge memorization probes. Besides, this also demonstrates the effectiveness of our carefully designed adversarial attacks in eliciting seemingly forgotten knowledge from the unlearned model.\\n\\n2. The method achieves even greater unlearning efficiency when fine-tuned on the synthetic forget corpus $C_{sf}$ compared to the pseudo ground-truth forget corpus $C^*_f$. This may be because, while $C^*_f$ encompasses a broader spectrum of knowledge about the target, it also includes a significant amount of irrelevant knowledge. Conversely, $C_{sf}$, generated by the original model itself, is likely more aligned with the model's internal memory.\\n\\n3. Nevertheless, almost all methods trained on $C_{sf}$ fail under MIA, indicating a need for more robust unlearning methods.\\n\\n4. Compared to full fine-tuning, LoRA unlearns less (on the forget set) and forgets less (on the retain set), consistent with recent findings on continued pretraining.\"}"}

(2) GA starts to lead to model collapse during training, which may affect the model's utility. For example, DPO rewards the model for not generating hallucinations, thereby significantly affecting factuality and truthfulness. RT requires the model to simply respond with \\\"I don't know\\\" when the model parameters, the classic GA and the recent NPO perform relatively well. These no effect on Phi-3, depending on the model's ability to follow instructions. For those methods that are also side effects on neighboring knowledge, which encourages the model to get knowledge, which encourages the model to simply respond with \\\"I don't know\\\".\\n\\nWe also explore a particularly challenging unlearning scenario, involving the forgetting of multiple targets simultaneously.

We also assess locality and utility in terms of neighbor perturbation, general ability, reasoning ability. We conduct a case study on the forgetting effects of unlearning methods. As shown in Figure 7, we can observe a phenomenon: fine-tuning the early layers leads to better unlearning effects without affecting neighbor knowledge. One possible explanation is that unlearning in the early layers may involve twisting the meanings of keywords related to the forgetting target. Another possible explanation is that the early layers store more factual knowledge [42; 16]. The localization of early layers may involve twisting the meanings of keywords related to the forgetting target.\\n\\n6 Conclusion and Future Work\\n\\nIn this work, we assess the necessity of partial-layer unlearning. RWKU is designed based on the following three key factors: (1) For the unlearning target knowledge is also a fascinating problem.

We conduct experiments on LLaMA3-Instruct (8B) and Phi-3 Mini-4K-Instruct (3.8B). For all methods trained on synthetic forget corpus, we set the number of training epochs to 3. For the GA method trained on the pseudo ground-truth forget corpus, we set the number of training epochs to 4, considering its relatively small size. Due to varying learning rate requirements for different methods, we select the learning rate for each method via grid search in the range of $10^{-8}$ to $10^{-5}$. We use AdamW with 20 step warm-up during training. We typically set the learning rate of LoRA to be ten times higher for the full fine-tuning. LoRA rank is set to 8 and LoRA alpha is set to 16. For the batch-target unlearning setting, we conduct experiments with target sizes of 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50. We set the number of training epochs to 2 for all methods. Compared to single-target unlearning, we set relatively smaller learning rates for each method to avoid model collapse. All experiments are conducted with eight A100 GPUs.
