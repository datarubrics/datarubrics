The results of this analysis are presented in Tab. 5. The consistency generally decreases as $k$ increases, with a dip observed at $k = 5$ (64%), reflecting the increasing complexity of the tasks. Interestingly, there is a noticeable rebound in consistency at $k = 6$ (72%) and $k = 7$ (92%), which might be attributed to the increasing complexity of compositional generation as $k$ grows. As the task becomes more challenging, the probability of generating fully correct images approaches zero. Consequently, both GPT-4o and human evaluators might converge on similar evaluation. Overall, these findings suggest that GPT-4o is capable of maintaining strong performance even as the complexity of the task varies, although some variability is observed in mid-range $k$ values.\\n\\nA.5 Qualitative Analysis\\n\\nDuring the evaluation, we noticed several instances where human evaluators disagreed among themselves or with the GPT-4o grading method. In some cases, GPT-4o tends to be stricter in its grading. For instance, an image slightly deviating from the prompt\u2019s specifics might receive a lower score from GPT-4o, while human evaluators might overlook minor discrepancies and incorrectly grade it higher. Here we show some examples:\\n\\nHuman-GPT-4o Disagreement Example 1 ($k=3$)\\n\\nPrompt: A photorealistic image shows a rectangle-shaped smartphone positioned in front of a table, closer to the observer.

In CV, studies have explored compositional generalization in disentangled representation learning [16, 11, 46], visual relations [27], as well as concept compositions [32]. Other works focus on compositional models for image generation [10], and planning for unseen tasks at inference time [9]. In NLP, compositional generalization has also been studied extensively [13, 23, 4, 20, 21, 28, 30].\\n\\nSKILL-MIX [47], a more recent evaluation on LLMs, presented a more general approach to evaluate compositional generalization. SKILL-MIX asks LLMs to produce novel pieces of text from random combinations of k skills, which can be made more difficult by simply increasing the value of k. CONCEPTMIX is partly inspired by SKILL-MIX, but requires a more complicated design in creating text prompts and effective grading.\\n\\nB.2 T2I models and compositional T2I benchmarks\\n\\nT2I models [35, 2, 3, 5, 33, 43, 25] generate images given text prompts. Traditionally, their performance is evaluated based on alignment with reference (image, caption) pairs. This involves querying the T2I model with the reference caption and assessing the consistency between the generated image and the reference image. Common benchmarks include TIFA160 [18], HRS-Bench [1], DrawBench [37]. When reference images are not provided, benchmarks with prompt templates are used for a more comprehensive measure of compositional capabilities [12, 5, 1, 19, 24]. Among them, the closest to ours is T2I-CompBench [19], which samples complex prompts to evaluate T2I models. However, as noted in Tab. 1, T2I-CompBench limits prompts to 5 concepts, while CONCEPTMIX uses up to 8 (i.e., k = 7).\\n\\nB.3 Evaluation metrics for generation\\n\\nMost previous benchmarks use similarity metrics like Inception Score [38, IS], Fr\u00e9chet Inception Distance [15, FID], and Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity [48, LPIPS] to quantify generation quality. These metrics, relying on pre-trained networks, primarily capture pixel-level similarity and often fail to fully capture semantic-level alignment. To address these limitations, recent methods [41, 45, 36] have adopted metrics like CLIPScore [34, 14], which measure cosine similarity between embedded image and text representations, and visual question answering pipelines [22, 49, 26] to better capture text-image alignment. Our evaluation also adopt the visual question answering pipeline for text-image consistency checking, but with a more careful design of asking appropriate questions to verify the generation quality of each visual concept thanks to our prompt generation pipeline.\"}"}

If so, could you fill in the missing part? Make sure it makes sense when you fill the missing part. Do not fill in anything else unless it is indicated by \"?\". You may add additional objects, but only in the following two cases:\\n* It is needed to fill in any \"?\" (Note when you fill \"?\", you should use existing objects first. If you still choose to add an object, explain why the existing objects cannot fulfill the need.); or\\n* If there is an attribute specified in the JSON that contains relative information (e.g. \\\"size\\\") and there is no other object for reference. (The reason for adding an object for this case is because one cannot tell whether an object is huge without any other object in the image, but we are fine if there is no such attribute mentioned in the JSON. Note other existing objects in JSON can be used for reference, and the reference object does not need to be the same object. If you still choose to add an object, explain why the existing objects cannot fulfill the need.)\\n\\nDO NOT add any object if none of the above situations is strictly satisfied, and DO NOT try to improve the image in other ways.

Using less effective models could compromise the quality of the evaluation. Since we only need to generate 300x7 images per model in our current settings, and considering the fact that new image generation models are not released frequently, the overall cost remains feasible within our research budget.

Human studies are significantly more expensive and time-consuming. For context, our human study cost $660 ($15 per person per hour) and required considerable time to organize and conduct. In contrast, using GPT-4o to evaluate a substantial set of images is considerably more cost-effective and can be completed much faster. Moreover, the cost of using the GPT-4o API has been decreasing over time (e.g., $5.00 per 1M input tokens for GPT-4o-2024-05-13, but $2.50 per 1M input tokens for GPT-4o-2024-08-16), making it an increasingly affordable option.\\n\\nD.3 Generation Configurations\\n\\nFor all open-source models, we use their checkpoints from Hugging Face for generation, as listed in Tab. 8, with their default generation configurations.

Existing evaluations of compositional capability rely heavily on human-designed text prompts or fixed templates, limiting their diversity and complexity, and yielding low discriminative power. We propose ConceptMix, a scalable, controllable, and customizable benchmark which automatically evaluates compositional generation ability of T2I models. This is done in two stages. First, ConceptMix generates the text prompts: concretely, using categories of visual concepts (e.g., objects, colors, shapes, spatial relationships), it randomly samples an object and k-tuples of visual concepts, then uses GPT-4 to generate text prompts for image generation based on these sampled concepts. Second, ConceptMix evaluates the images generated in response to these prompts: concretely, it checks how many of the k concepts actually appeared in the image by generating one question per visual concept and using a strong VLM to answer them. Through administering ConceptMix to a diverse set of T2I models (proprietary as well as open ones) using increasing values of k, we show that our ConceptMix has higher discrimination power than earlier benchmarks. Specifically, ConceptMix reveals that the performance of several models, especially open models, drops dramatically with increased k. Importantly, it also provides insight into the lack of prompt diversity in widely-used training datasets. Additionally, we conduct extensive human studies to validate the design of ConceptMix and compare our automatic grading with human judgement. We hope it will guide future T2I model development.\\n\\n1 Introduction\\nText-to-Image (T2I) generation, which produces images given a text prompt describing it (see Figure 1), has made remarkable progress [35, 43, 25, 33] with the rise of diffusion models [42, 17]. However, complicated scene descriptions can still trip up these models in subtle ways that are hard to measure using traditional perceptual metrics (e.g. FID [15], IS [38], LPIPS [48]) and embedding-based approaches (e.g. CLIP [34]). This has motivated new T2I evaluations. Complicated scene descriptions often involve many visual concepts, i.e., fundamental visual elements such as objects, colors, and spatial relationships present in the image. Compositional Text-to-Image (T2I) generation refers to the ability of models to generate images that accurately combine multiple visual concepts.\\n\\nChallenges in compositional T2I evaluation.\\nSeveral existing benchmarks focus on compositionality [19, 26]. But developing a comprehensive and expandable compositional T2I benchmark remains challenging for several reasons. First, it is tricky to generate prompts that effectively compose multiple visual concepts while still maintaining coherence and realism. The difficulties arising from tricky interactions increases exponentially with the number of concepts, making it difficult to manually design diverse prompts that cover a wide range of visual concepts. As a result, existing benchmarks...\"}"}

For each category, we provide definitions, concepts, and appearances in our text prompts.\\n\\n| Category | Concepts | Example of Text Prompt containing it |\\n|----------|----------|-------------------------------------|\\n| Objects  | car, chair, sushi, etc. | A woman is holding a ring in her hand |\\n| Colors   | red, yellow, pink, etc. | A single blue dog is present in the image. |\\n| Numbers  | two, three, four, etc. | The image shows exactly four sheep standing on a grassy field. |\\n| Shapes   | circle, square, triangle, etc. | An oak tree with a heart-shaped outline stands prominently in the scene. |\\n| Sizes    | tiny, huge, etc. | A huge cow is standing next to a sheep. |\\n| Textures | metallic, glass, fluffy, etc. | The image features a house with a glass texture. |\\n| Spatial  | on top of, behind, inside, etc. | The image shows a bench with an oak tree positioned behind it. |\\n| Styles   | cartoon, sketch, watercolor, etc. | A sketch shows a single ring drawn with simple lines. |\\n\\nCONCEPTMIX involves no compositionality, we focus on $k \\\\geq 1$ for the rest of the paper. By increasing $k$, we can evaluate the more challenging and realistic task of compositional generation, testing models' ability to combine multiple concepts.\\n\\nWe design CONCEPTMIX with two main objectives: 1) generating coherent text prompts from randomly selected concepts, and 2) automatically grading images based on complex prompts, particularly as the difficulty level ($k$) increases. The first objective is crucial for creating diverse, challenging prompts that can test T2I models' true compositional capabilities and generalization to novel concept combinations. The second objective enables us to systematically, and automatically evaluate T2I models on complex prompts. To tackle the first goal, we carefully select the sets of concepts (\u00a72.2) and design a four-step pipeline for generating and validating the text prompts (\u00a72.3). Building on this pipeline, we tackle the second goal by developing evaluation methods in \u00a72.4 to grade the presence of the required concepts in the generated images and to aggregate a final evaluation score.\\n\\n2.2 Selecting Visual Concepts\\n\\nCONCEPTMIX includes eight categories of visual concepts: objects, colors, numbers, textures, shapes, sizes, styles, and spatial relationships, covering a much wider range of concepts than prior work [19] (see Tab. 2 for descriptions and examples). To ensure valid text prompts (see \u00a72.3), we exclude concept categories where eligibility is highly object-dependent. For instance, actions are typically limited to a specific subset of objects, e.g., most objects cannot \\\"cut\\\", \\\"dance\\\" or \\\"fly\\\". This exclusion is crucial because our random selection of concepts, despite a filtering mechanism (see \u00a72.3), would be less efficient if categories like actions were included.\\n\\nFor each category, we identify representative concepts from existing literature [19, 26] and supplement them with a diverse set generated by GPT-4. We then filter concepts that: 1) rarely combine with others (e.g., \\\"spongy\\\" texture), 2) are challenging for current T2I models even individually [44] (e.g., the number \\\"6\\\"), and 3) are difficult to judge objectively (e.g., \\\"median\\\" size, \\\"minimalism\\\" style).\\n\\n2.3 Compositional Prompt Generation\\n\\nCONCEPTMIX ($k$) evaluates compositional capability by randomly sampling $k$ concepts with one object, and prompting T2I models to generate images containing all of them. This process involves four steps: 1) randomly select $k$ concept categories and choose concepts from them (concept sampling), 2) generate a description for each concept and create a JSON representation of the binding structure (concept binding), 3) generate a text prompt based on the binding structure (prompt generation), and 4) validate the generated text prompt using GPT-4o (prompt validation). Details of each step and the GPT-4o query templates are provided in Appendix C.\"}"}

If spatial is selected as one of the categories, we ask GPT-4 to bind each spatial concept with two objects. In some cases, a concept may need a reference object to be accurately illustrated. For example, one cannot judge if an object is tiny or not if it is the only object in the image. In such cases, we also request GPT-4 to add appropriate reference objects. We formalize the binding as $k + 1$ statements (one for each concept) and a JSON object. In Fig. 2, we provide an example ($k = 4$) demonstrating the concept binding process.\\n\\nStep 3: Prompt Generation.\\nGiven the $k + 1$ statements and the binding structure represented in JSON format, GPT-4 is asked to make up a human-annotated description of a hypothetical image that matches the statements and the JSON object. GPT-4 is instructed to avoid introducing unnecessary objects or descriptions, as detailed in the prompting template in Appendix C.\\n\\nStep 4: Prompt Validation.\\nBefore we feed the text prompts to T2I models, we have a prompt rejection mechanism (as detailed in Appendix C.2) to validate the text prompts with GPT-4 to rule out text prompts with hard conflict between visual concepts. Note that we do not simply remove unrealistic prompts (e.g., a horse with glass texture, as shown in Fig. 2), as they can be utilized to test the creativity of T2I models. As another example, it rejects text prompts requesting a triangle-shaped person but keeps text prompts requesting a square-shaped cloud, since clouds can naturally have various abstract shapes, while a triangle-shaped person conflicts with the perceptual constraints on human form. GPT-4 is asked to provide an explanation if it considers the text prompt invalid.\\n\\n2.4 Concept Evaluation\\nWe evaluate the generated images from T2I models by utilizing the visual question-answering capability of GPT-4. Specifically, for each statement used in text prompt generation, we first ask GPT-4 to generate the corresponding yes or no question based on both the statement and the text prompt, and then send the question with the generated image to GPT-4 in a new conversation and record its answer (\u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo\u201d). We award one point for each correctly illustrated statement, so the maximum possible points is $k + 1$.\\n\\nNote naively asking GPT-4 or other vision language models (VLMs) whether the generated image matches the text prompt does not work well from our preliminary experiments, especially when $k$ is large and the text prompts are complicated. Decomposing the text prompt is often used as an alternative for evaluating images generated from text prompts [8, 18]. However, previous decomposing methods may generate nonsensical questions when handling complex prompts [26], and thus harm their accuracy. Since the text prompts used in CONCEPT MIX are generated from given concepts, we have effectively decomposed the text prompt correctly. Although there might be additional information injected during our text prompt generation pipeline, we ensure the information injection is minimal and natural at each step. Our approach provides a reliable and precise method for evaluating the generated images based on the decomposed concepts from the original text prompt.\\n\\n3 Human Evaluation\\nTo evaluate the performance of our automatic grading with GPT-4, we conducted human evaluations with 10 participants, including both experts and non-experts. The evaluation covered 14 sets: 8 models at $k = 3$ and DALL\u00b7E 3 at $k = 1$ through 7. Each set contained 25 text prompts, generated images, and questions. Each of the 350 pairs was evaluated by 5 participants. Our procedure was reviewed and approved by our internal Institutional Review Board (IRB) and we obtained participant consent. The human evaluation involves a two-step process: 1) Image-Prompt Alignment: participants evaluate the overall alignment between the generated image and the text prompt; 2) Individual Questions: they answer individual yes/no questions based on the image. Detailed evaluation instructions and qualitative analysis are in Appendix A.\\n\\nHuman annotations are inconsistent and often miss details. Our analysis reveals notable inconsistencies in human annotations. We found that in 4.52% of cases, evaluators incorrectly answered \u201cYes\u201d to step 1 image-prompt alignment when their step 2 individual concept evaluations collectively indicated \u201cNo,\u201d and vice versa in 4.93% of cases. These discrepancies result in a 9% divergence rate between steps 1 and 2, showing the importance of breaking down alignment evaluation into\"}"}

From Fig. 3a, we observe that GPT-4o is close to human scores, except for $k = 6$, the human evaluators give much higher scores than the GPT-4o. It may be caused by human oversight when the complexity of text prompts increases. Despite this, the overall trend of human scores shows a decline as $k$ increases, matching the trend of GPT-4o scores. In Fig. 3b, we observe that the human ranking is also similar to GPT-4o ranking.\\n\\nGPT-4o grader in general shows high consistency with human annotators. We compute the consistency scores among human annotators and between human annotators and GPT-4o in Fig. 11 in Appendix A.

We further conduct experiments with previous state-of-the-art grading approach [26] and compare them with human preferences. As shown in Fig. 3, our grading method aligns better with human preferences. For example, in Fig. 3a, as $k$ grows, both our grading results and human majority vote results generally decrease. This trend, however, is not observed with T2VScore. Our method achieves a high correlation with human evaluations, with $r = 0.93$ for GPT-4o compared to T2VScore's $r = 0.47$. Additionally, in Fig. 3b, we observe that T2VScores remain similar across many models and do not correlate as well with human scores, with a correlation of $r = 0.69$ compared to our method's $r = 0.81$. Our method stands out by accounting for different difficulty levels and this shows that our grading approach can differentiate between various generation models and better reflect human preferences.\\n\\nConsistency Analysis Across Different Concept Categories.

These results show that GPT-4 performs relatively well across different categories, with the highest consistency observed in the object (90.86%) and color (86.21%) categories. However, as expected, the consistency is lower in categories such as spatial and style, which involve more complex spatial reasoning and style recognition tasks which are also challenging to human participants. Other categories like shape (79.61%), size (76.92%), and texture (76.03%) fall between these extremes.\\n\\n4 Experiments\\nIn this section, we present a systematic evaluation of eight T2I models on CONCEPTMIX, with the experimental setup detailed in \u00a74.1. We begin by analyzing the performance of individual concept categories ($k = 1$, see \u00a74.2) to assess how well models handle specific concept categories in isolation. Next, we evaluate the models' performance when combining multiple concept categories ($k > 1$, see \u00a74.3), and compare CONCEPTMIX with other existing evaluation pipelines (\u00a74.4). Finally, we explore whether common training datasets are sufficient for effective compositional generation (\u00a74.5).\\n\\n4.1 Experimental Setup\\nEvaluated models. We evaluate eight state-of-the-art T2I models: SD v1.4 [35], DeepFloyd IF XL v1, SD v2.1, SDXL Base [33], SDXL Turbo [39], Playground v2.5 [25], PixArt alpha [7], and DALL\u00b7E 3 [2]. We provide the details of generation configuration and compute details for our evaluation in Appendix D.\\n\\nPrompt Generation Details. We randomly generate text prompts from CONCEPTMIX, as detailed in \u00a72.3, and request models for generations. Each prompt includes at least one object along with $k$ additional visual concept categories. Unless specified otherwise, we randomly assign concepts from each category. We evaluate with $k \\\\in \\\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\\\\}$, and for each $k$, we generate 300 text prompts to capture the variability and performance across different models.\\n\\nConcept Evaluation Details. Given a fixed $k$, we use GPT-4o, as described in \u00a72.4, to grade each image and determine the number of points awarded out of $k+1$, with each point representing a required concept. We consider two grading metrics: 1) Full-mark score, which measures the proportion of generated images where the image correctly satisfies all $k+1$ required concepts, and 2) Concept fraction score, which measures the average proportion of visual concepts satisfied by the generated images. Unless otherwise specified, the term 'performance' refers to full-mark score. For each model and each $k$, we report the full-mark score (Tab. 4) and concept fraction score (Appendix D.5), aggregated over 300 sampled prompts, and provide the 95% confidence interval for each score.\\n\\n4.2 Performance on Individual Concept Categories ($k = 1$)\\nWe begin by analyzing the performance of the models on the case $k = 1$ with each concept category, i.e., the ability to generate images of a random object and a concept within the selected category. This is the simplest form of compositional image generation. Our findings are listed as follows.\\n\\nColor and style are easiest while spatial, size, and shape are challenging. Fig. 4 shows each model's performance across categories. A notable trend is that color and style are easier categories than others. For instance, DALL\u00b7E 3 excels in color and style, achieving perfect scores, and performs well in texture as well. However, it scores considerably lower in number and spatial categories, achieving only 0.75 and 0.61, respectively. Such findings highlight the limitations of using pixel-level similarity scores for evaluation.

As shown in Tab. 4, DALL\u00b7E 3 consistently outperforms other models across all $k$ difficulty levels and can handle complex compositional tasks more effectively. As $k$ increases, all models show a significant drop in performance. Among all, the performance of SD v1.4 decreases the fastest as $k$ increases, as we can see its performance approaching zero when $k = 3$. Other models also experience performance drops but at different rates. The models can be roughly ranked by their position in the table, with DALL\u00b7E 3 being the best, and SD v1.4 being the worst.

Shaded areas indicate the score range from easier to harder visual concepts for each $k$.\\n\\n**Easy and hard variants of ConceptMix.**\\n\\nWe create two variants of ConceptMix based on \u00a74.2: one only uses the easy subsets of all categories, and the other uses the hard subsets. In Fig. 7, we plot the performance of three models on the two variants, as well as the standard ConceptMix. With both variants, we again observe the degradation of model performance when $k$ increases. Furthermore, the model ranking remains consistent, indicating the robustness of ConceptMix. Although the easy and hard subsets are selected based on Playground v2.5 performance on these concepts with $k = 1$, models always achieve higher scores on the easy variant compared to the hard variant.\\n\\n### 4.4 ConceptMix has stronger discriminative power than other evaluation pipelines\\n\\nWe compare ConceptMix with the prior compositional generation benchmark, T2I-CompBench [19], which uses a fixed template to combine at most five visual concept categories within a single prompt (see Tab. 1). While T2I-CompBench incorporates several evaluation metrics, its limited concept and prompt diversity often lead to closely clustered scores for different models, making it challenging to differentiate their performance (see Fig. 8). This lack of differentiation also hinders the identification of model limitations.\\n\\nIn contrast, ConceptMix includes a wider range of concept categories with a total of 96 unique visual concepts and prompting variations (see Appendix C), and offers a more precise and discriminative grading approach (see Fig. 8), especially as $k$ increases. When considering $k = 1$, ..., 7 elements, the total number of combinations reaches approximately 145 billion. This offers extensive evaluation for the compositional generation of T2I models.\"}"}
{"id": "MU2s9wwWLo", "page_num": 10, "content": "{\"primary_language\":\"en\",\"is_rotation_valid\":true,\"rotation_correction\":0,\"is_table\":false,\"is_diagram\":false,\"natural_text\":\"4.5 Tracing the poor performance of models back to lack of diversity in training data\\nTo further investigate the relatively poor compositional capabilities of the models, we explore whether the complexity of visual concepts in the training data might be a contributing factor. We randomly sample 1000 image captions from LAION [40], a widely used dataset for training T2I models, following ethical use guidelines for research purposes. For each caption, we use GPT-4o to identify the presence of eight visual concept categories (object, color, number, shape, size, spatial, style, and texture), with the instructions for GPT-4o provided in Appendix D. We filter out captions that did not contain objects (leaving 882 out of 1000) and plot the frequency of each concept in Fig. 9.\\n\\nDisparate concept representation in LAION-5B. Our analysis reveals a significant disparity in the presence of different visual concepts within the LAION-5B dataset. While most captions included color (476) and style (269), only a small number contained shape (24) and spatial (20) concepts. This uneven distribution aligns with the individual visual concept performance observed in Section 4.2, suggesting that a model's proficiency in a particular visual concept might be directly influenced by the frequency of its representation in the training data.\\n\\nLimited exposure to complex concept combinations in LAION-5B. Furthermore, we find that each example from the sampled LAION-5B collection, on average, contains only $2.75 \\\\pm 0.90$ concept categories, with a maximum of six concepts per example. This limited exposure to complex combinations of visual concepts in the training data likely contributes to the observed difficulty models face when dealing with $k \\\\geq 3$ (see Tab. 4).\\n\\n5 Discussion\\nLimitations. One potential limitation of CONCEPTMIX is the potential misalignment between autograding and human grading. While our method aligns with human preference better than previous metrics, it may overlook nuances human graders capture, particularly in cases where the generated images are ambiguous. Therefore, while our grading engine offers consistent and scalable evaluation, outperforming previous approaches, it still cannot fully replicate human judgment.\\n\\nNegative Impacts. T2I models trained on web-scale data carry inherent risks, such as privacy and copyright violations, and social bias perpetuation. Although our work focuses on the evaluation of the generative models, with the goal of reducing errors in generation, the downside is that CONCEPTMIX may also provide further legitimacy to generative models despite their ethical concerns.\\n\\n6 Conclusion\\nCompositional capabilities are critical for T2I generation. We gave evidence that existing evaluations of compositionality, which generate prompts automatically with fixed templates, actually result in prompts with low diversity and discriminative power. We propose CONCEPTMIX, a scalable and customizable benchmark for evaluating the compositional capabilities of T2I models, including prompts from 8 visual concept categories. Our approach uses a powerful LLM in two ways to address the limitations of existing benchmarks. The first is in generating suitable prompts given a random set of visual concepts. The second is to enable automated grading of the generated image by providing a list of questions that can be used with a VLM (GPT-4o in our case) to check the correctness of the generated images. CONCEPTMIX allows generating a wide variety of prompts \u2014 the total number of possible prompts is larger than the size of popular training datasets. We find that CONCEPTMIX effectively differentiates between models, offering a more granular understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of generation models compared to traditional benchmarks.\"}"}

If the image aligns with the description, your answer should be 1 (yes). If the image does not align with the description, your answer should be 0 (no).\\n\\nStep 2: Individual Questions.\\nFor each specific question listed, determine if the answer is 1 (yes) or 0 (no) based on the image. Note that once you start step 2, you can not return to step 1 to change your answers.\\n\\nExample:\\n\\nStep 1: Image-Prompt Alignment.\\nPrompt: A photorealistic image shows a rectangle-shaped smartphone positioned in front of a table, closer to the observer. The smartphone is clearly distinguishable from the table behind it.\\n\\nStep 2: Individual Questions.\\nQuestion #1: Does the image contain a smartphone?\\nQuestion #2: Is the style of the image photorealism?\\nQuestion #3: Is the smartphone rectangle-shaped?\\nQuestion #4: Is the smartphone positioned in front of the table, closer to the observer?\\n\\nIn addition to the instructions and example above, we also offer general guidance for visual concepts that may be subjective in judgment. Specifically,\\n\\nSize\\nFor \u201ctiny\u201d and \u201chuge\u201d, judge whether the object is tiny or huge compared to its normal size in reality, which can be inferred based on the size of other objects (assuming the other objects have normal sizes).\\n\\nStyle\\nWe define all the art styles in the rubric and provide reference images.\\n\\nA.2 Human Agreement Analysis\\n\\nFig. 10 shows the variability in agreement rates across different evaluation steps for DALL-E 3, with $k=1$ showing high agreement between evaluation steps 1 and 2, while $k=6$ shows lower agreement.\\n\\nFactors contributing to these inconsistencies may include cognitive biases, fatigue, and the complexity of the subject matter. Our experiments show the importance of a structured and granular approach in evaluation processes to improve alignment and reliability in evaluation, particularly for complex compositional capability.\\n\\nA.3 Pairwise Consistency Analysis\\n\\nThe average consistency score among human evaluators for this task is 0.85, showing the subjectivity and difficulty nature of the T2I evaluation. The consistency score between the human majority vote and GPT-4o is 0.81, which is similar to the inter-annotator consistency. Notably, at $k=5$ and $k=6$, there is a noticeable decrease in agreement among human evaluators and between humans and GPT-4o, indicating greater variability in these settings. The average human-to-human consistency score across all these models is 0.87 for $k=3$. These findings reveal variations in human evaluations, which differ notably from automated approaches.\"}"}

Existing evaluations of compositional capability rely heavily on human-designed text prompts or fixed templates, limiting their diversity and complexity, and yielding low discriminative power. We propose ConceptMix, a scalable, controllable, and customizable benchmark which automatically evaluates compositional generation ability of T2I models. This is done in two stages. First, ConceptMix generates the text prompts: concretely, using categories of visual concepts (e.g., objects, colors, shapes, spatial relationships), it randomly samples an object and k-tuples of visual concepts, then uses GPT-4o to generate text prompts for image generation based on these sampled concepts. Second, ConceptMix evaluates the images generated in response to these prompts: concretely, it checks how many of the k concepts actually appeared in the image by generating one question per visual concept and using a strong VLM to answer them. Through administering ConceptMix to a diverse set of T2I models (proprietary as well as open ones) using increasing values of k, we show that our ConceptMix has higher discrimination power than earlier benchmarks. Specifically, ConceptMix reveals that the performance of several models, especially open models, drops dramatically with increased k. Importantly, it also provides insight into the lack of prompt diversity in widely-used training datasets. Additionally, we conduct extensive human studies to validate the design of ConceptMix and compare our automatic grading with human judgement. We hope it will guide future T2I model development.\\n\\n1 Introduction\\nText-to-Image (T2I) generation, which produces images given a text prompt describing it (see Figure 1), has made remarkable progress [35, 43, 25, 33] with the rise of diffusion models [42, 17]. However, complicated scene descriptions can still trip up these models in subtle ways that are hard to measure using traditional perceptual metrics (e.g. FID [15], IS [38], LPIPS [48]) and embedding-based approaches (e.g. CLIP [34]). This has motivated new T2I evaluations. Complicated scene descriptions often involve many visual concepts, i.e., fundamental visual elements such as objects, colors, and spatial relationships present in the image. Compositional Text-to-Image (T2I) generation refers to the ability of models to generate images that accurately combine multiple visual concepts.\\n\\nChallenges in compositional T2I evaluation. Several existing benchmarks focus on compositional-ity [19, 26]. But developing a comprehensive and expandable compositional T2I benchmark remains challenging for several reasons. First, it is tricky to generate prompts that effectively compose multiple visual concepts while still maintaining coherence and realism. The difficulties arising from tricky interactions increases exponentially with the number of concepts, making it difficult to manually design diverse prompts that cover a wide range of visual concepts. As a result, existing benchmarks...\"}"}

Here we show some prompts generated using a different number of visual concepts. Each prompt uses a default object and a random selection of additional visual concepts from \\\\( k \\\\) categories (\\\\( k = 1 \\\\ldots 7 \\\\), and \\\\( k = 0 \\\\) means one object, \\\\( k = 1 \\\\) means an object with one additional concept, etc.). We show images generated by DALL\u00b7E 3 [2] for these prompts. Note that the images are not part of CONCEPTMIX benchmark; the benchmark is a distribution of visual prompts and corresponding evaluation questions. Our CONCEPTMIX provides a scalable, controllable and customizable benchmark for compositional T2I evaluation.\\n\\nTable 1: Comparison of Compositional T2I Benchmarks.\\n\\n| Benchmark | Concept Diversity | Concept Binding Method | # Concepts in Each Text Prompt |\\n|-----------|-------------------|------------------------|-------------------------------|\\n| CC-500 [12] | 2 categories | Fixed template | 2 |\\n| ABC-6K [12] | 2 categories | Fixed template | 2 |\\n| Attn-Exct [6] | 4 categories | Fixed template | 2 |\\n| HRS-comp [1] | 2 categories | Fixed template | \\\\( \\\\leq 3 \\\\) |\\n| T2I-CompBench [19] | 6 categories | Fixed template, ChatGPT augmented | \\\\( \\\\leq 5 \\\\) |\\n| CONCEPTMIX (ours) | 8 categories | Free-form, GPT-4o generated | Unlimited |\\n\\nOften cover only a subset of visual concepts. Second, accurately and simultaneously evaluating multiple concepts present in the generated images is challenging. This becomes increasingly complex as the number of concepts grows, leading most evaluations to lack scalability and flexibility. They typically cap prompts to at most five concepts due to use of fixed templates for concept combination (e.g., \\\"a {adj} {noun}\\\"). This makes it hard to do more complex and flexible evaluations. In Tab. 1, we summarize the diversity and complexity of visual concepts and their composition in existing compositional benchmarks.\\n\\nIn this work, we propose CONCEPTMIX, a scalable and flexible benchmark that evaluates the compositional generation capabilities of T2I models. CONCEPTMIX operates in two key stages. First, in the prompt generation stage, CONCEPTMIX uses not fixed prompt templates but GPT-4o [31] to create prompts by combining one random object with \\\\( k \\\\) random visual concepts. We consider eight categories of visual concepts, including objects, colors, numbers, shapes, sizes, textures, styles, and spatial relationships. The resulting prompts of CONCEPTMIX are much more diverse and complex than those of existing benchmarks (as shown in Tab. 1), which typically compose up to five visual concepts per prompt and fail to reflect the full complexity of real-world scenarios.\\n\\nSecond, in the concept evaluation stage, CONCEPTMIX evaluates the images generated in response to these prompts by checking how many of the concepts appeared correctly in the image. This is done by generating one question per visual concept and using GPT-4o [31] to answer them. Our prompt generation pipeline also enables efficient and accurate prompt decomposition, thus we can evaluate results based on each individual concept and aggregate the results as the final score for each image.\\n\\nFig. 2 provides an overview of CONCEPTMIX along with a \\\\( k = 4 \\\\) example. Our prompt generation allows easy updating and expansion of the visual concepts to be evaluated, which is demonstrated later in \u00a74.3 where we create variants of CONCEPTMIX. Additionally, the number of possible combinations of visual concepts grows exponentially with \\\\( k \\\\). Thus, with a large \\\\( k \\\\), CONCEPTMIX can generate millions of unique prompts, making it impossible for models to cheat by simply memorizing or overfitting to its training set. Thus CONCEPTMIX offers a precise and discriminative approach to identify differences in capabilities that may not be captured by traditional leaderboards or benchmarks. This provides a better understanding of a model's strengths.\"}"}

This is done by converting the generation statements into questions and evaluating the answers. The image receives a score of 1 if it correctly matches all concepts, and 0 if any concept is not satisfied.\\n\\nWe summarize our main contributions as follows:\\n\\n1. We introduce CONCEPT MIX (\u00a72), the first T2I benchmark for evaluating the compositional generation with more than five visual concepts.

By increasing $k$, we can evaluate the more challenging and realistic task of compositional generation, testing models' ability to combine multiple concepts.\\n\\nWe design CONCEPT-MIX with two main objectives: 1) generating coherent text prompts from randomly selected concepts, and 2) automatically grading images based on complex prompts, particularly as the difficulty level ($k$) increases. The first objective is crucial for creating diverse, challenging prompts that can test T2I models' true compositional capabilities and generalization to novel concept combinations. The second objective enables us to systematically, and automatically evaluate T2I models on complex prompts. To tackle the first goal, we carefully select the sets of concepts (\u00a72.2) and design a four-step pipeline for generating and validating the text prompts (\u00a72.3). Building on this pipeline, we tackle the second goal by developing evaluation methods in \u00a72.4 to grade the presence of the required concepts in the generated images and to aggregate a final evaluation score.\\n\\n2.2 Selecting Visual Concepts\\n\\nCONCEPT-MIX includes eight categories of visual concepts: objects, colors, numbers, textures, shapes, sizes, styles, and spatial relationships, covering a much wider range of concepts than prior work [19] (see Tab. 2 for descriptions and examples). To ensure valid text prompts (see \u00a72.3), we exclude concept categories where eligibility is highly object-dependent. For instance, actions are typically limited to a specific subset of objects, e.g., most objects cannot \\\"cut\\\", \\\"dance\\\" or \\\"fly\\\". This exclusion is crucial because our random selection of concepts, despite a filtering mechanism (see \u00a72.3), would be less efficient if categories like actions were included.\\n\\nFor each category, we identify representative concepts from existing literature [19, 26] and supplement them with a diverse set generated by GPT-4. We then filter concepts that: 1) rarely combine with others (e.g., \\\"spongy\\\" texture), 2) are challenging for current T2I models even individually [44] (e.g., the number \\\"6\\\"), and 3) are difficult to judge objectively (e.g., \\\"median\\\" size, \\\"minimalism\\\" style).\\n\\n2.3 Compositional Prompt Generation\\n\\nCONCEPT-MIX ($k$) evaluates compositional capability by randomly sampling $k$ concepts with one object, and prompting T2I models to generate images containing all of them. This process involves four steps: 1) randomly select $k$ concept categories and choose concepts from them (concept sampling), 2) generate a description for each concept and create a JSON representation of the binding structure (concept binding), 3) generate a text prompt based on the binding structure (prompt generation), and 4) validate the generated text prompt using GPT-4 (prompt validation). Details of each step and the GPT-4 query templates are provided in Appendix C.\\n\\nStep 1: Concept Sampling.\\n\\nWe first sample $k + 1$ concept categories, then sample specific concepts from those categories. We always ensure that the first concept comes from the object category. The remaining $k$ concepts have a $1/4$ chance of being objects and a $3/4$ chance of being sampled from the other seven categories. This distribution helps to avoid two undesirable scenarios: (1) having most prompts contain too many objects, and (2) having most prompts contain only one object. This ensures diverse representations of concepts while maintaining a strong focus on objects, which are central to the image. We resample if there is more than one concept sampled from the style category or if the number of concepts from any category (except for the spatial category) exceeds the number of objects. This is to maintain a balanced composition and prevent any single concept category from dominating the generated image.\"}"}
{"id": "MU2s9wwWLo", "page_num": 5, "content": "{\"primary_language\":\"en\",\"is_rotation_valid\":true,\"rotation_correction\":0,\"is_table\":false,\"is_diagram\":false,\"natural_text\":\"Step 2: Concept Binding.\\n\\nFor concepts from the color, number, shape, size, or texture categories, we randomly select an object and bind the concept to it. If spatial is selected as one of the $k$ categories, we ask GPT-4 to bind each spatial concept with two objects. In some cases, a concept may need a reference object to be accurately illustrated. For example, one cannot judge if an object is tiny or not if it is the only object in the image. In such cases, we also request GPT-4 to add appropriate reference objects. We formalize the binding as $k + 1$ statements (one for each concept) and a JSON object. In Fig. 2, we provide an example ($k = 4$) demonstrating the concept binding process.\\n\\nStep 3: Prompt Generation.\\n\\nGiven the $k + 1$ statements and the binding structure represented in JSON format, GPT-4 is asked to make up a human-annotated description of a hypothetical image that matches the statements and the JSON object. GPT-4 is instructed to avoid introducing unnecessary objects or descriptions, as detailed in the prompting template in Appendix C.\\n\\nStep 4: Prompt Validation.\\n\\nBefore we feed the text prompts to T2I models, we have a prompt rejection mechanism (as detailed in Appendix C.2) to validate the text prompts with GPT-4 to rule out text prompts with hard conflict between visual concepts. Note that we do not simply remove unrealistic prompts (e.g., a horse with glass texture, as shown in Fig. 2), as they can be utilized to test the creativity of T2I models. As another example, it rejects text prompts requesting a triangle-shaped person but keeps text prompts requesting a square-shaped cloud, since clouds can naturally have various abstract shapes, while a triangle-shaped person conflicts with the perceptual constraints on human form. GPT-4 is asked to provide an explanation if it considers the text prompt invalid.\\n\\n2.4 Concept Evaluation\\n\\nWe evaluate the generated images from T2I models by utilizing the visual question-answering capability of GPT-4. Specifically, for each statement used in text prompt generation, we first ask GPT-4 to generate the corresponding yes or no question based on both the statement and the text prompt, and then send the question with the generated image to GPT-4 in a new conversation and record its answer (\u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo\u201d). We award one point for each correctly illustrated statement, so the maximum possible points is $k + 1$.\\n\\nNote naively asking GPT-4 or other vision language models (VLMs) whether the generated image matches the text prompt does not work well from our preliminary experiments, especially when $k$ is large and the text prompts are complicated. Decomposing the text prompt is often used as an alternative for evaluating images generated from text prompts [8, 18]. However, previous decomposing methods may generate nonsensical questions when handling complex prompts [26], and thus harm their accuracy. Since the text prompts used in CONCEPT MIX are generated from given concepts, we have effectively decomposed the text prompt correctly. Although there might be additional information injected during our text prompt generation pipeline, we ensure the information injection is minimal and natural at each step. Our approach provides a reliable and precise method for evaluating the generated images based on the decomposed concepts from the original text prompt.\\n\\n3 Human Evaluation\\n\\nTo evaluate the performance of our automatic grading with GPT-4, we conducted human evaluations with 10 participants, including both experts and non-experts. The evaluation covered 14 sets: 8 models at $k = 3$ and DALL\u00b7E 3 at $k = 1$ through 7. Each set contained 25 text prompts, generated images, and questions. Each of the 350 pairs was evaluated by 5 participants. Our procedure was reviewed and approved by our internal Institutional Review Board (IRB) and we obtained participant consent. The human evaluation involves a two-step process: 1) Image-Prompt Alignment: participants evaluate the overall alignment between the generated image and the text prompt; 2) Individual Questions: they answer individual yes/no questions based on the image. Detailed evaluation instructions and qualitative analysis are in Appendix A.\\n\\nHuman annotations are inconsistent and often miss details. Our analysis reveals notable inconsistencies in human annotations. We found that in 4.52% of cases, evaluators incorrectly answered \u201cYes\u201d to step 1 image-prompt alignment when their step 2 individual concept evaluations collectively indicated \u201cNo,\u201d and vice versa in 4.93% of cases. These discrepancies result in a 9% divergence rate between steps 1 and 2, showing the importance of breaking down alignment evaluation into 2\\n\\nIf there aren't enough existing objects for binding the spatial concepts, we request GPT-4 to add objects that naturally fit into the scene.\"}"}

From Fig. 3a, we observe that GPT-4o is close to human scores, except for $k = 6$, the human evaluators give much higher scores than the GPT-4o. It may be caused by human oversight when the complexity of text prompts increases. Despite this, the overall trend of human scores shows a decline as $k$ increases, matching the trend of GPT-4o scores. In Fig. 3b, we observe that the human ranking is also similar to GPT-4o ranking. GPT-4o grader in general shows high consistency with human annotators.\\n\\nWe compute the consistency scores among human annotators and between human annotators and GPT-4o in Fig. 11 in Appendix A. Consistency score is defined as the ratio of two scorers giving the same score for a (prompt, image) pair among all of the (prompt, image) pairs. The average consistency score between human annotators for this task is 0.85, showing the relative subjectivity and challenge of the evaluation. The consistency score between the human majority vote and GPT-4o is 0.81, which is comparable to the inter-annotator consistency score.\\n\\nCompare with prior grading approach. We further conduct experiments with previous state-of-the-art grading approach [26] and compare them with human preferences. As shown in Fig. 3, our grading method aligns better with human preferences. For example, in Fig. 3a, as $k$ grows, both our grading results and human majority vote results generally decrease. This trend, however, is not observed with T2VScore. Our method achieves a high correlation with human evaluations, with $r = 0.93$ for GPT-4o compared to T2VScore's $r = 0.47$. Additionally, in Fig. 3b, we observe that T2VScores remain similar across many models and do not correlate as well with human scores, with a correlation of $r = 0.69$ compared to our method's $r = 0.81$. Our method stands out by accounting for different difficulty levels and this shows that our grading approach can differentiate between various generation models and better reflect human preferences.\"}"}

We evaluate with k \u2208 {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}, and for each k, we generate 300 text prompts to capture the variability and performance across different models.\\n\\nConcept Evaluation Details. Given a fixed k, we use GPT-4o, as described in \u00a72.4, to grade each image and determine the number of points awarded out of k + 1, with each point representing a required concept. We consider two grading metrics: 1) Full-mark score, which measures the proportion of generated images where the image correctly satisfies all k + 1 required concepts, and 2) Concept fraction score, which measures the average proportion of visual concepts satisfied by the generated images. Unless otherwise specified, the term 'performance' refers to full-mark score. For each model and each k, we report the full-mark score (Tab. 4) and concept fraction score (Appendix D.5), aggregated over 300 sampled prompts, and provide the 95% confidence interval for each score.\\n\\n4.2 Performance on Individual Concept Categories (k = 1)\\nWe begin by analyzing the performance of the models on the case k = 1 with each concept category, i.e., the ability to generate images of a random object and a concept within the selected category. This is the simplest form of compositional image generation. Our findings are listed as follows. Color and style are easiest while spatial, size, and shape are challenging. Fig. 4 shows each model's performance across categories. A notable trend is that color and style are easier categories than others. For instance, DALL\u00b7E 3 excels in color and style, achieving perfect scores, and performs well in texture as well. However, it scores considerably lower in number and spatial categories, achieving only 0.75 and 0.61, respectively. Such findings highlight the limitations of using pixel-level similarity scores for evaluation. While these scores effectively capture style and color accuracy, they struggle to accurately reflect spatial, shape, and size. Consequently, models that perform well on these scores might still fall short in accurately generating spatial, shape, and size information.\"}"}

Similar variations are observed in other categories with other models, suggesting the existence of disparities in generation performance even within the same visual concept category.

The results of this analysis are presented in Tab. 5. The consistency generally decreases as $k$ increases, with a dip observed at $k = 5$ (64%), reflecting the increasing complexity of the tasks. Interestingly, there is a noticeable rebound in consistency at $k = 6$ (72%) and $k = 7$ (92%), which might be attributed to the increasing complexity of compositional generation as $k$ grows. As the task becomes more challenging, the probability of generating fully correct images approaches zero. Consequently, both GPT-4o and human evaluators might converge on similar evaluation. Overall, these findings suggest that GPT-4o is capable of maintaining strong performance even as the complexity of the task varies, although some variability is observed in mid-range $k$ values.\\n\\nA.5 Qualitative Analysis\\n\\nDuring the evaluation, we noticed several instances where human evaluators disagreed among themselves or with the GPT-4o grading method. In some cases, GPT-4o tends to be stricter in its grading. For instance, an image slightly deviating from the prompt\u2019s specifics might receive a lower score from GPT-4o, while human evaluators might overlook minor discrepancies and incorrectly grade it higher.

We create two variants of ConceptMix based on \u00a74.2: one only uses the easy subsets of all categories, and the other uses the hard subsets. In Fig. 7, we plot the performance of three models on the two variants, as well as the standard ConceptMix. With both variants, we again observe the degradation of model performance when $k$ increases. Furthermore, the model ranking remains consistent, indicating the robustness of ConceptMix. Although the easy and hard subsets are selected based on Playground v2.5 performance on these concepts with $k = 1$, models always achieve higher scores on the easy variant compared to the hard variant.\\n\\n4.4 ConceptMix has stronger discriminative power than other evaluation pipelines\\n\\nWe compare ConceptMix with the prior compositional generation benchmark, T2I-CompBench [19], which uses a fixed template to combine at most five visual concept categories within a single prompt (see Tab. 1). While T2I-CompBench incorporates several evaluation metrics, its limited concept and prompt diversity often lead to closely clustered scores for different models, making it challenging to differentiate their performance (see Fig. 8). This lack of differentiation also hinders the identification of model limitations.\\n\\nIn contrast, ConceptMix includes a wider range of concept categories with a total of 96 unique visual concepts and prompting variations (see Appendix C), and offers a more precise and discriminative grading approach (see Fig. 8), especially as $k$ increases. When considering $k = 1$, ...,$7$ elements, the total number of combinations reaches approximately 145 billion. This offers extensive evaluation for the compositional generation of T2I models.\"}"}

Our analysis reveals a significant disparity in the presence of different visual concepts within the LAION-5B dataset. While most captions included color (476) and style (269), only a small number contained shape (24) and spatial (20) concepts. This uneven distribution aligns with the individual visual concept performance observed in Section 4.2, suggesting that a model's proficiency in a particular visual concept might be directly influenced by the frequency of its representation in the training data.\\n\\nLimited exposure to complex concept combinations in LAION-5B. Furthermore, we find that each example from the sampled LAION-5B collection, on average, contains only $2.75 \\\\pm 0.90$ concept categories, with a maximum of six concepts per example. This limited exposure to complex combinations of visual concepts in the training data likely contributes to the observed difficulty models face when dealing with $k \\\\geq 3$ (see Tab. 4).\\n\\n5 Discussion\\n\\nLimitations. One potential limitation of CONCEPT MIX is the potential misalignment between autograding and human grading. While our method aligns with human preference better than previous metrics, it may overlook nuances human graders capture, particularly in cases where the generated images are ambiguous. Therefore, while our grading engine offers consistent and scalable evaluation, outperforming previous approaches, it still cannot fully replicate human judgment.\\n\\nNegative Impacts. T2I models trained on web-scale data carry inherent risks, such as privacy and copyright violations, and social bias perpetuation. Although our work focuses on the evaluation of the generative models, with the goal of reducing errors in generation, the downside is that CONCEPT MIX may also provide further legitimacy to generative models despite their ethical concerns.\\n\\n6 Conclusion\\n\\nCompositional capabilities are critical for T2I generation. We gave evidence that existing evaluations of compositionality, which generate prompts automatically with fixed templates, actually result in prompts with low diversity and discriminative power. We propose CONCEPT MIX, a scalable and customizable benchmark for evaluating the compositional capabilities of T2I models, including prompts from 8 visual concept categories. Our approach uses a powerful LLM in two ways to address the limitations of existing benchmarks. The first is in generating suitable prompts given a random set of visual concepts. The second is to enable automated grading of the generated image by providing a list of questions that can be used with a VLM (GPT-4o in our case) to check the correctness of the generated images. CONCEPT MIX allows generating a wide variety of prompts \u2014 the total number of possible prompts is larger than the size of popular training datasets. We find that CONCEPT MIX effectively differentiates between models, offering a more granular understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of generation models compared to traditional benchmarks.\"}"}

If the image aligns with the description, your answer should be 1 (yes). If the image does not align with the description, your answer should be 0 (no).\\n\\nStep 2: Individual Questions.\\n\\nFor each specific question listed, determine if the answer is 1 (yes) or 0 (no) based on the image. Note that once you start step 2, you cannot return to step 1 to change your answers.\\n\\nExample:\\n\\nStep 1: Image-Prompt Alignment.\\n\\nPrompt: A photorealistic image shows a rectangle-shaped smartphone positioned in front of a table, closer to the observer. The smartphone is clearly distinguishable from the table behind it.\\n\\nStep 2: Individual Questions.\\n\\nQuestion #1: Does the image contain a smartphone?\\n\\nQuestion #2: Is the style of the image photorealism?\\n\\nQuestion #3: Is the smartphone rectangle-shaped?\\n\\nQuestion #4: Is the smartphone positioned in front of the table, closer to the observer?\\n\\nIn addition to the instructions and example above, we also offer general guidance for visual concepts that may be subjective in judgment. Specifically,\\n\\nSize\\n\\nFor \u201ctiny\u201d and \u201chuge\u201d, judge whether the object is tiny or huge compared to its normal size in reality, which can be inferred based on the size of other objects (assuming the other objects have normal sizes).\\n\\nStyle\\n\\nWe define all the art styles in the rubric and provide reference images.\\n\\nA.2 Human Agreement Analysis\\n\\nFig. 10 shows the variability in agreement rates across different evaluation steps for DALL\u00b7E 3, with $k = 1$ showing high agreement between evaluation steps 1 and 2, while $k = 6$ shows lower agreement.\\n\\nFactors contributing to these inconsistencies may include cognitive biases, fatigue, and the complexity of the subject matter. Our experiments show the importance of a structured and granular approach in evaluation processes to improve alignment and reliability in evaluation, particularly for complex compositional capability.\\n\\nA.3 Pairwise Consistency Analysis\\n\\nThe average consistency score among human evaluators for this task is 0.85, showing the subjectivity and difficulty nature of the T2I evaluation. The consistency score between the human majority vote and GPT-4o is 0.81, which is similar to the inter-annotator consistency. Notably, at $k = 5$ and $k = 6$, there is a noticeable decrease in agreement among human evaluators and between humans and GPT-4o, indicating greater variability in these settings. The average human-to-human consistency score across all these models is 0.87 for $k = 3$. These findings reveal variations in human evaluations, which differ notably from automated approaches.\"}"}

The rejection mechanism is fully automated, ensuring consistency across all generated prompts. Only prompts that meet all criteria are accepted, which improves the reliability of the generated prompts. This resulted in a rejection rate of approximately 13-52% of initially generated prompts, primarily due to the shape information. The rejection rate goes up as k increases. Here are some examples of rejection reasons:\"}"}

Larger values of $k$ result in longer and potentially more complex prompts.\\n\\n- \\\"A triangle-shaped cat is difficult to conceptualize in a realistic image as animals typically do not have geometric shapes.\\\"\\n- \\\"A hill cannot be rectangle-shaped as hills are naturally irregular in shape, and it's not practical to represent them as rectangles in a meaningful context.\\\"\\n\\nPrompt Length. We also provide the distribution of text prompt lengths for different values of $k$. The length of the text prompt may indicate the complexity of the task, as longer prompts tend to involve more concepts. The distribution of text prompt lengths for each $k$ is shown in Fig. 12.\\n\\nConcept-Prompt Discrepancies. In examining the discrepancies between the selected concepts and the generated prompts, we find that the generated prompts accurately reflect the visual concepts in the majority of cases. However, in very few instances (approximately 1% of the time), we observe minor discrepancies. For instance:\\n\\n- Visual Concepts: bee, sushi, cow, man, chair, circle, tiny, cartoon.\\n- Prompt: In a cartoon-style image, a tiny, circle-shaped cow sits on a chair. A man stands nearby, holding a piece of sushi. A bee is flying above the scene.\\n\\nIn this case, the man \\\"holding a piece of sushi\\\" is not explicitly provided in the selected visual concepts. Nevertheless, the overall high accuracy of concept representation shows the robustness of our prompt generation pipeline, with only minimal refinements potentially needed to capture these rare, more complex scenarios.\\n\\nC.3 Question Generation\\n\\nFor each generated prompt, we also accompany it with a list of GPT-4o-generated questions, as detailed in \u00a72.4, which are later used for grading. Specifically, we use the following instruction:\\n\\nInstructions given to GPT-4o for question generation\\n\\nA student just draw a picture based on your description. Can you help me verify whether the student did a good job? Specifically, I want to know if the image follows your description and also follows the properties I mentioned earlier. You should ask me one yes or no question for each property, and I will tell you if they are satisfied. For example, for properties like \\\"the image contains one or more [object name]\\\", the corresponding question should be \\\"Does the image contain [object name]\\\". Respond only the $k$ questions, one for each property, in the same order of the properties, and each on a new line.\\n\\nConcept-Prompt-Question Discrepancies. We analyzed 100 randomly sampled prompts to identify cases where concepts mentioned in the prompts were not given in the selected visual concepts. Only one case (1%) showed a mismatch between the prompt and derived questions. For instance:\\n\\n- Visual Concepts: pine tree, bee, tiny, photorealism, tiny, metallic, top, left\\n- Prompt: A tiny pine tree on the left side of the image has a tiny metallic bee positioned on top of it.

Using less effective models could compromise the quality of the evaluation. Since we only need to generate 300x7 images per model in our current settings, and considering the fact that new image generation models are not released frequently, the overall cost remains feasible within our research budget. Please find detailed cost information on the OpenAI API Pricing webpage.\\n\\n**Input Cost:**\\n300 (# images) \u00d7 7 (# k) \u00d7 8 (# models) = 16,800 images in total.\\n\\n- **Image:** A 1024x1024 image (the largest size in our experiment) costs $0.003825 using GPT-4o-2024-05-13, 16,800 \u00d7 $0.003825 = $64.26\\n- **Text:** Each question has roughly 20 words, approximately 27 tokens. With 8 questions per image maximum and 16,800 images, 27 (# tokens) \u00d7 8 (# questions) \u00d7 16,800 (# images) = 3,628,800 tokens, 3,628,800 tokens \u00d7 $2.50/1M tokens = $9.07.\\n\\n**Output Cost:**\\nAssuming each yes/no answer is about 1 token, 8 (# questions) \u00d7 16,800 (# images) = 134,400 tokens, 134,400 (# tokens) \u00d7 $7.50/1M tokens = $1.01\\n\\n**Total:** Roughly $74.34 for our entire grading using GPT-4o across all k and all models.\\nIt is also worth comparing the cost of GPT-4o to that of human evaluation studies. Human studies are significantly more expensive and time-consuming. For context, our human study cost $660 ($15 per person per hour) and required considerable time to organize and conduct. In contrast, using GPT-4o to evaluate a substantial set of images is considerably more cost-effective and can be completed much faster. Moreover, the cost of using the GPT-4o API has been decreasing over time (e.g., $5.00 per 1M input tokens for GPT-4o-2024-05-13, but $2.50 per 1M input tokens for GPT-4o-2024-08-16), making it an increasingly affordable option.\\n\\nD.3 Generation Configurations\\nFor all open-source models, we use their checkpoints from Hugging Face for generation, as listed in Tab. 8, with their default generation configurations. For DALL-E, we generate images via its API endpoint with the default settings.\\n\\nD.4 Experimental details for \u00a74.5\\nIn \u00a74.5, we analyze the concept diversity of LAION [40] (MIT License).

In CV, studies have explored compositional generalization in disentangled representation learning [16, 11, 46], visual relations [27], as well as concept compositions [32]. Other works focus on compositional models for image generation [10], and planning for unseen tasks at inference time [9]. In NLP, compositional generalization has also been studied extensively [13, 23, 4, 20, 21, 28, 30]. SKILL-MIX [47], a more recent evaluation on LLMs, presented a more general approach to evaluate compositional generalization. SKILL-MIX asks LLMs to produce novel pieces of text from random combinations of k skills, which can be made more difficult by simply increasing the value of k. C-MIX is partly inspired by SKILL-MIX, but requires a more complicated design in creating text prompts and effective grading.\\n\\nB.2 T2I models and compositional T2I benchmarks\\n\\nT2I models [35, 2, 3, 5, 33, 43, 25] generate images given text prompts. Traditionally, their performance is evaluated based on alignment with reference (image, caption) pairs. This involves querying the T2I model with the reference caption and assessing the consistency between the generated image and the reference image. Common benchmarks include TIFA160 [18], HRS-Bench [1], DrawBench [37]. When reference images are not provided, benchmarks with prompt templates are used for a more comprehensive measure of compositional capabilities [12, 5, 1, 19, 24]. Among them, the closest to ours is T2I-CompBench [19], which samples complex prompts to evaluate T2I models. However, as noted in Tab. 1, T2I-CompBench limits prompts to 5 concepts, while C-MIX uses up to 8 (i.e., k = 7).\\n\\nB.3 Evaluation metrics for generation\\n\\nMost previous benchmarks use similarity metrics like Inception Score [38, IS], Fr\u00e9chet Inception Distance [15, FID], and Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity [48, LPIPS] to quantify generation quality. These metrics, relying on pre-trained networks, primarily capture pixel-level similarity and often fail to fully capture semantic-level alignment. To address these limitations, recent methods [41, 45, 36] have adopted metrics like CLIPScore [34, 14], which measure cosine similarity between embedded image and text representations, and visual question answering pipelines [22, 49, 26] to better capture text-image alignment. Our evaluation also adopt the visual question answering pipeline for text-image consistency checking, but with a more careful design of asking appropriate questions to verify the generation quality of each visual concept thanks to our prompt generation pipeline.\"}"}

For concept bind, we utilize the JSON format, and start with a JSON in the following structure:\\n\\n**Example of Initial JSON for concept binding**\\n\\n```\\n{\"objects\": [{\"id\": 1, \"item\": \"teddy bear\", \"color\": \"green\", \"texture\": \"glass\", \"number\": \"4\"}, {\"id\": 2, \"item\": \"laptop\", \"shape\": \"rectangle\", \"size\": \"tiny\"}], \"style\": \"oil painting\", \"relation\": [{\"name\": \"behind\", \"description\": \"{ObjectA} is behind {ObjectB}, meaning {ObjectA} is positioned farther from the observer or camera than {ObjectB}\", \"ObjectA_id\": \"?\", \"ObjectB_id\": \"?\"}\\n```\\n\\nWe intentionally leave some question marks for spatial relationships, and ask GPT-4 to fill them and potentially add new objects if needed. The instruction given to GPT-4 is as follows:\\n\\n**Instructions given to GPT-4 for finalize JSON**\\n\\nI am trying to create an image containing exactly the following things in a JSON format:\\n\\n[Initial JSON]\\n\\nCould you check if there is '?' left in the JSON? If so, could you fill in the missing part? Make sure it makes sense when you fill the missing part.

(Note when you fill '?', you should use existing objects first. If you still choose to add an object, explain why the existing objects cannot fulfill the need);\\n* If there is an attribute specified in the JSON that contains relative information (e.g. \\\"size\\\") and there is no other object for reference. (The reason for adding an object for this case is because one cannot tell whether an object is huge without any other object in the image, but we are fine if there is no such attribute mentioned in the JSON. Note other existing objects in JSON can be used for reference, and the reference object does not need to be the same object. If you still choose to add an object, explain why the existing objects cannot fulfill the need.)\\n\\nDO NOT add any object if none of the above situations is strictly satisfied, and DO NOT try to improve the image in other ways. If you choose to add an object, make sure it fits in the image naturally.
