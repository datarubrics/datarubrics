The completeness of ESG reports is considered a crucial criterion for judging their quality and credibility, yet it is often overlooked in existing literature. This paper aims to comprehensively assess the completeness of ESG reports by evaluating their topic coverage and text quality. To achieve this goal, we collect 14,468 ESG reports from Chinese-listed companies. We then segment these reports into sentences and label over 8,000 of them with both topic and text quality tags. Finally, we propose two classification tasks based on the ESG sentences: topic classification and quality classification, to evaluate the ESG completeness. To train the classifiers, we fine-tuned several large language models (LLMs) on this dataset for the two classification tasks. Our findings suggest that the dataset has the potential to fill the gap in academia regarding methods for measuring ESG completeness.\\n\\nIntroduction\\nWith the increasing awareness of sustainable development in society, how companies balance economic benefits with environmental benefits and social benefits has garnered close public attention. In this context, corporate environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance has become a rapidly evolving focus. Currently, ESG reports are a crucial means for companies to disclose their ESG performance, providing essential information for investors and stakeholders seeking insights into a company's commitment to these areas. Concerns have been raised regarding the ability of ESG reports to accurately reflect a company's contributions towards sustainable development. Skeptics argue that ESG reports may act as a form of decoupling\u2014a symbolic practice that is disconnected from actual performance, such as selective disclosure. Selective disclosure, as shown in Figure 1, refers to the practice where companies disproportionately highlight favorable or relatively benign performance indicators to obscure their overall less impressive performance, thereby seeking to gain or maintain legitimacy. Authors in [32] found that decoupling is prevalent in sustainability reports, with 69% of negative events being selectively reported. Numerous non-profit organizations and NGOs, such as the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board Foundation (SASB), and Bloomberg, introduced specific ESG indicator systems to mitigate this issue. These systems aim to clarify the essential ESG topics that companies should disclose, ensuring the completeness of ESG reports.\\n\\nCompleteness is a crucial criterion for assessing the quality of ESG reports. It requires companies to comprehensively disclose significant economic, environmental, and social impacts related to their...\"}"}

We collected ESG reports of publicly listed companies from the Internet. Each sentence in these reports is labeled with 36 categories of ESG tags. Using these ESG tags, we performed a quantitative analysis of the completeness of the reports. The completeness panel illustrates two examples: Company A, which exhibits a comprehensive ESG report, and Company B, which selectively discloses information by omitting categories such as \u201cnatural capital\u201d, \u201cproduct responsibility\u201d, and \u201cstakeholder\u201d.\\n\\nOperations [26]. Scholars emphasized that ESG reports are credible only when they meet completeness requirements [33, 26]. However, the academic community lacks scientific methods for evaluating ESG completeness. Additionally, international regulatory rules, such as the European Union\u2019s Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), mandate that complete ESG reports should include both quantitative and qualitative information [2]. Furthermore, many countries and international stock exchanges encourage issuers to prioritize quantitative information in their ESG reports [6, 24]. Therefore, when studying the completeness of ESG reports, attention should be paid not only to the topics covered but also to the quality of their content.\\n\\nDue to the diverse categories and extensive content covered by ESG topics [10], large-scale monitoring and identification of the completeness of ESG reports are extremely challenging, requiring domain experts to analyze company documents. This necessitates the construction of open, high-quality datasets suitable for training and evaluating models in such contexts, which can be alleviated through the rapid text classification processes facilitated by natural language processing (NLP).\\n\\nHowever, it is important to note that existing datasets do not support research on the completeness of ESG reports. Although existing works provided datasets in the field of sustainability, they only focus on part of the ESG topics, such as climate and environmental areas [38, 27]. Additionally, many studies utilize unsupervised models like Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) [3] to learn topic structures, relying on word co-occurrence trends [14, 16]. However, LDA is an unsupervised model with significant uncertainty in the number and criteria of clusters, meaning the topics generated and interpreted by one researcher may not completely align with those of another [4]. Hence, a fine-grained and labeled ESG dataset is essential for evaluating ESG completeness.\\n\\nTo address this need, we introduce a comprehensive dataset representing corporate ESG engagement, compiled from a wide range of company-related documents as illustrated in Figure 1. This dataset facilitates the detection of ESG report completeness, the generation and optimization of ESG reports, the evaluation of stakeholder assessments of corporate sustainability strategies, and the support of ESG fund investment decision-making systems. Initially, we evaluate the completeness of ESG reports based on topic coverage and disclosure quality, establishing an ESG tree and a two-tier classification system for ESG text quality. Utilizing this framework, we collected all ESG reports from Chinese-listed companies spanning the period, sourced from the official website of the Chinese stock exchange. We manually annotated 8,467 text sentences, each assigned two types of labels:\"}"}

These reports encompass a range of topics, including specific initiatives,\\nsignificant risks, and policy goals undertaken by companies across ESG dimensions [ 1, 13, 15].\\nHowever, due to the lack of mandatory ESG reporting frameworks and strong government regulations\\nworldwide, there are significant differences in the quantity, reporting formats, and content of ESG\\nreports disclosed by companies [12]. Additionally, managers often have opportunistic motives for\\nselectively disclosing information [25]. Consequently, the completeness of ESG reports has been\\nquestioned [28]. While many companies report substantial ESG information on various topics,\\nthe information is often one-sided, lacking disclosure on key ESG issues [ 29]. Some companies\\nfocus excessively on key dimensions related to their business operations while neglecting other CSR\\ntopics [29].\\n\\nNLP Research Related to the ESG completeness\\nExisting works examined the completeness of\\nESG reports by analyzing the coverage of ESG topics [26, 16, 22]. In [16] and [22], researchers utilize\\nunsupervised models, such as LDA, to learn the topic structure and cluster ESG texts, subsequently\\nanalyzing the content and trends of various topics. For instance, [16] revealed that ESG information\\ndisclosed by publicly listed companies in the UK and Europe primarily focuses on employee safety,\\nemployee training support, carbon emissions, human rights, efficient electricity, and healthcare\\nproducts. However, as an unsupervised model, LDA presents significant uncertainty in generating and\\ninterpreting text topics [4]. Consequently, these methods are ineffective in evaluating the completeness\\nof ESG report topics or identifying selective disclosure behaviors by listed companies.\\n\\n3 Dataset\\nOur dataset assesses ESG report completeness from two perspectives: topic coverage and text quality.\\nIt offers valuable insights for various research applications. In the field of NLP, it encourages the\\napplication of NLP technologies in sustainable development. In the domains of sustainability and\\nfinance, models trained on our dataset can evaluate the completeness and credibility of a company\u2019s\\nESG reports, thereby informing investment decisions for ESG funds.\\n\\n3\"}"}

To achieve this, we segment each sentence and label it with both topic and quality tags. Suppose report \\\\( X_i \\\\) contains \\\\( n_i \\\\) sentences. Thus, \\\\( X_i = \\\\{ x_{ij} \\\\}_{j=1}^{n_i} \\\\), where \\\\( x_{ij} \\\\) is the \\\\( j \\\\)-th sentence of report \\\\( i \\\\), with \\\\( j = 1, 2, \\\\ldots, n_i \\\\).\\n\\nFor each sentence \\\\( x_i \\\\), we assign two kinds of labels: one is the topic label \\\\( y \\\\), and the other is the quality label, denoted \\\\( z \\\\). We believe that both \\\\( y \\\\) and \\\\( z \\\\) contribute to the completeness of \\\\( X_i \\\\). The topic label \\\\( y \\\\) is a 36-dimensional one-hot vector corresponding to the leaf nodes of the ESG tree shown in Figure 2. Details regarding the 36 topic labels will be discussed in the next section. The quality label \\\\( z \\\\) is a 2-dimensional one-hot vector representing \\\"Quantitative description\\\" and \\\"Qualitative description\\\".\\n\\nWe collect ESG reports \\\\( X_i \\\\) released by Chinese-listed companies from the official website of the China Stock Exchange, resulting in a total of 14,468 documents. Following the definitions of the labels \\\\( y \\\\) and \\\\( z \\\\), we engage three Ph.D. researchers specializing in the ESG domain to annotate training sets for the 36 topic labels \\\\( y \\\\) and the 2 quality labels \\\\( z \\\\). This process results in 8,467 manually labeled text sentences. We exclude 483 irrelevant ones, such as tables of contents and acknowledgments, which are unrelated to the ESG topic content. Subsequently, we assign two labels to the remaining 7984 sentences: the topic and quality labels. Consequently, we obtain the dataset \\\\( D = \\\\{ x_j, y_j, z_j \\\\} \\\\_{j=1}^{8467} \\\\), as illustrated in Table 1. The average length of these sentences is 80 Chinese characters. By segmenting the unlabeled ESG reports, we obtained over 3.2 million sentences, forming the out-of-distribution sample set.\\n\\n| Train Test ESG Class | Quality Class | Average Len | Out-of-distribution samples |\\n|----------------------|--------------|-------------|-----------------------------|\\n| 6,773 1,694 36 2     | 80.54        | 3,216,968   |\\n\\nTable 1: Dataset description.\\n\\n3.2 Two types of ESG label and ESG completeness\\n\\n- **ESG topic label**: We use the ESG tree, as shown in Figure 2, to define the completeness with the topic classification. The topic labels \\\\( y \\\\) correspond to the leaf node of ESG tree. We construct the ESG tree according to the standards of internationally recognized third-party organizations, including GRI, SASB, the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI), Bloomberg, the China Securities Index (CSI), and SynTao Green Finance (SGF).\\n\\n  Figure 2 illustrates the four-layer ESG tree we constructed, a hierarchical framework that dissects corporate sustainability into Environmental, Social, and Governance dimensions, each further divided into related sub-topics. For example, the second-level indicator \\\"Environment\\\" includes three third-level indicators: climate change, natural capital, and sustainable development management. Furthermore, for climate change, the leaf nodes are carbon emissions and response to climate change. The ESG tree incorporates the disclosure requirements mandated by Chinese regulatory authorities for listed companies' ESG reports. For instance, the China Securities Regulatory Commission encourages listed companies to disclose their contributions to rural revitalization in China. To align with this requirement, we include \\\"Rural Assistance\\\" as a third-level topic. For detailed sources of the ESG tree labels, please refer to Appendix 1.\\n\\n- **Text quality label**: We define ESG text quality through two types of labels. Based on our literature analysis, international authoritative ESG rating agencies, national securities regulatory authorities, and international stock exchanges increasingly emphasize that ESG reports should include crucial quantitative data in addition to qualitative descriptions [17]. Furthermore, there is growing encouragement for disclosing quantitative information [35]. Therefore, we examine the quality of ESG text as a crucial component in assessing the completeness of ESG reports.

For instance, we assign scores of 2 to \u201cQuantitative\u201d sentences and 1 to \u201cQualitative\u201d sentences. Thus, for a specific topic in an ESG report that contains one \u201cQuantitative\u201d sentence and one \u201cQualitative\u201d sentence, the topic frequency would be calculated as 2 + 1 = 3, rather than simply 2.\\n\\n4 Experiment\\n\\nIn this section, we evaluate our method for assessing ESG completeness on the constructed dataset.
