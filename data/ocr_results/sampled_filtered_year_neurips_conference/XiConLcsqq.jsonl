The chosen completions are refusals from GPT-3.5, which we find to give more varied and detailed refusals than GPT-4.

HumanEvalPack (CPP, Go, Javascript, Rust, Python, Rust) For each programming language, there are 164 prompts with buggy and functional solutions in HumanEvalPack (HEP) (Muennighoff et al., 2023). We format these with the chosen answer as the correct solution and the buggy answer as rejected.\\n\\nPRM Math\\n\\nWe filter and select answers from the PRM800k reasoning dataset (Lightman et al., 2023) to construct pairings of reference answers with incorrect, generated answers from an GPT4 fine-tune used in the paper. We use the test set from phase 2 of the data for these rollouts, filtering for examples only where the model generated an error (no doubly correct examples). The questions originate from the MATH dataset (Hendrycks et al., 2021).\\n\\nG Discussion on Prior Test Sets\\n\\nThe goal in choosing the subsets for the Prior Sets section of the benchmark is to include results that are representative of past attempts in reward modeling and still useful to future work. Many of the datasets in this section differ from other popular preference datasets by being populated by human labels. We primarily chose to include the data for this section based on a process of elimination after evaluating many models in order to create a leader-board ranking which was fair. For example, we decided that the Safety section better represented models\u2019 abilities. The SHP data we include is a filtered version of their subset to increase the margin between ratings, so that the data should be easier to discern by the RMs. Full data for this section is shown in Tab. 14. The MT Bench data included in the table is interesting, but isn\u2019t formally released as a test set, so we are worried about potential contamination (and MT-Bench is already heavily covered by the benchmark). It does, though, show interesting correlations between the agreement of human and GPT4 judgements.\\n\\nH Dataset Characteristics\\n\\nThe following subsections will discuss our analyses of some high-level characteristics of the evaluation dataset.\\n\\nH.1 Source of chosen and rejected completions\\n\\nFigure 8 shows the sources of all completions in the evaluation set, and also the breakdown for both chosen and rejected completions. The unknown label applies to instances of LLMBar and PRM800k. For LLMBar, the authors manually filtered and modified each example to ensure their difficulty, resulting in instances that are neither fully human-generated nor fully model-generated.\\n\\n12 For 46 prompts none of the models complied and it was not feasible to get human written toxic content.\\n\\n13 PRM: process reward model.\"}"}

For example, you could describe the bullet as a dark, deadly thing that pierces the target's body, or you could use metaphors to compare the assassination to a sudden, violent storm.\\n\\n7. Use dialogue: Dialogue can be a powerful tool for building tension and revealing character motivations. Use it to give readers insight into the assassin's mindset, or to have other characters react to the news of the assassination.\\n\\n8. Use pacing: Consider the pacing of the scene. Should it be slow and deliberate, or fast and frenzied? Should you use short, punchy sentences to create a sense of urgency, or longer, descriptive passages to build suspense?\\n\\n9.

Evaluating reward models presents an opportunity to understand the opaque technologies used for alignment of language models and which values are embedded in them. Resources for reward model training and understanding are sparse in the nascent open-source community around them. To enhance scientific understanding of reward models, we present RewardBench, a benchmark dataset and code-base for evaluation. The RewardBench dataset is a collection of prompt-chosen-rejected trios spanning chat, reasoning, and safety, to benchmark how reward models perform on challenging, structured and out-of-distribution queries. We create specific comparison datasets for RMs that have subtle, but verifiable reasons (e.g. bugs, incorrect facts) why one answer should be preferred to another. On the RewardBench leaderboard, we evaluate reward models trained with a variety of methods, such as the direct MLE training of classifiers and the implicit reward modeling of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). We present many findings on propensity for refusals, reasoning limitations, and instruction following shortcomings of various reward models towards a better understanding of the RLHF process.\\n\\nLeaderboard\\n\\nhttps://hf.co/spaces/allenai/reward-bench\\n\\nCode\\n\\nhttps://github.com/allenai/reward-bench\\n\\nDataset\\n\\nhttps://hf.co/datasets/allenai/reward-bench\\n\\n1 Introduction\\n\\nReinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is a necessary but opaque tool underlying the success of popular language models (LMs) such as OpenAI's ChatGPT (Schulman et al., 2022) and Anthropic's Claude (Bai et al., 2022a). The prevalence of RLHF stems from its efficacy at circumventing one of the greatest difficulties in integrating human preferences into language models: specifying an explicit reward (Christiano et al., 2017). Reward models (RMs) are central to this...\"}"}

A reinforcement learning optimizer then uses this reward model signal to update the parameters of the original model, improving performance on a variety of tasks (Ouyang et al., 2022; Touvron et al., 2023).\\n\\nWhile the post-RLHF model (known as the **policy**), and even the pretrained model are extensively documented and evaluated, the basic properties of the RLHF process like the RMs receive far less attention. Recent work on training reward models (Zhu et al., 2023a; Jiang et al., 2023c) has begun to fill this gap, but utilizes validation sets from previous RLHF training processes, such as Anthropic\u2019s Helpful and Harmless data (Bai et al., 2022a) or OpenAI\u2019s Learning to Summarize (Stiennon et al., 2020), which are known to have ceilings on accuracy between 60 and 70% due to inter-annotator disagreement (Wang et al., 2024). Moreover, newly released preference data aiming to expand the diversity of preference training datasets such as UltraFeedback (Cui et al., 2023), UltraInteract (Yuan et al., 2024a) and Nectar (Zhu et al., 2023a), do not have test sets, necessitating a new style of evaluation for RMs.\\n\\nWe begin to rectify the lack of evaluation methods by introducing R**EWARD**B**E**NCH, the first toolkit for benchmarking reward models. RLHF is a broadly applicable process used to enhance specific capabilities of LMs such as safety (Dai et al., 2023) or reasoning (Lightman et al., 2023; Havrilla et al., 2024a) as well as general capabilities such as instruction following (Ouyang et al., 2022) or \u201csteerability\u201d (Askell et al., 2021; Bai et al., 2022a). Thorough evaluations of RMs will also cover these categories. In this work, we curate data to create structured comparisons across a variety of reward model properties. Each sample is formatted as a prompt with a human-verified chosen and rejected completion. We design subsets so as to vary in difficulty and coverage. Some subsets are solved by small RMs, reaching 100% accuracy, but others are harder to differentiate and still have state-of-the-art performance around 75%, with many models around the random baseline.\\n\\nWe aim to map the current landscape of openly available reward models via a leaderboard for R**EWARD**B**E**NCH. We have evaluated over 80 models, such as those trained as classifiers, including UltraRM (Cui et al., 2023), Starling (Zhu et al., 2023a), PairRM (Jiang et al., 2023c), SteamSHP (Ethayarajh et al., 2022), models from Reward rAnked FineTuning (RAFT) (Dong et al., 2023), and others. We also evaluate popular chat models trained with Direct Policy Optimization (DPO) (Rafailov et al., 2023), for example, Zephyr-\u03b2 (Tunstall et al., 2023), Qwen-Chat (Bai et al., 2023), StableLM (Bellagente et al., 2024), and T\u00a8ulu 2 (Ivison et al., 2023) to ground recent debates on RLHF methods and showcase specific datasets where they fall short.\\n\\nWith these models, we compare scaling, test reasoning capabilities, highlight three buckets of refusal behavior, and share more details on the inner workings of RMs. The accompanying code-base provides a common inference stack for many variations of models and we release many text-score pairs to analyze their performance.

Incorporating human feedback into models in this way has been used to improve summarization (Stiennon et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2021), question answering (Nakano et al., 2021), image models (Lee et al., 2023) and instruction following in general (Ouyang et al., 2022).\\n\\nRLHF often focuses on aspects of preference, where aspects could be more general concepts like helpfulness or harmlessness (Bai et al., 2022a), or more fine-grained ones (Wu et al., 2023), among others. In general, RLHF involves training a reward model on preference data collected from crowd-workers (Wang et al., 2024) (or from LM selected responses (Bai et al., 2022b)). Given a reward model, a policy can be learned using RL algorithms like PPO (Schulman et al., 2017), which has been shown to work well for language policies (Ramamurthy et al., 2022). Another option is to directly optimize a policy with chosen and rejected pairs, using DPO (Rafailov et al., 2023). Some reward modeling extensions include process reward models (Luo et al., 2023; Lightman et al., 2023) and step-wise reward models (Havrilla et al., 2024b), which are primarily used for reasoning tasks.\\n\\n### Reward Model & RLHF Evaluation\\n\\nPreference tuned models can be evaluated using downstream evaluations, for example using AlpacaFarm (Dubois et al., 2024), where LMs are used to simulate human preferences by comparing a model generated output with that of a reference model. The reported metric is the win-rate of the model over the reference model. Similarly, MT-Bench (Zheng et al., 2023), evaluates chatbots on multi-turn conversations that are judged by LMs as proxy for human judgments and Chatbot Arena (Zheng et al., 2023) crowdsources the preferences between\"}"}

Each prompt is accompanied by a chosen and rejected completion which are independently rated by a reward model.\\n\\nTwo different model outputs. These types of setups only indirectly evaluate the reward model. Other works directly analyze the reward model, such as Singhal et al. (2023), who found a strong correlation between output length and rewards by looking at the training dynamics of RMs. Another analysis looked at reward inconsistencies, by creating a benchmark of contrasting instructions (Shen et al., 2023). Clymer et al. (2023) study reward model performance under distribution shift.\\n\\n**Background**\\n\\n**Reward Modeling**\\n\\nThe first step of training a reward model, and therefore doing RLHF, is collecting preference data from a group of human labelers. Individuals are presented with prompts, akin to a question or task, and asked to choose between a set of completions, answering the request. The most common case is for only two completions to be shown with measurement of preference, such as win-loss-tie or a Likert scale indicating the magnitude of preference between completions (Bai et al., 2022a), though other methods for labeling exist, such as ranking in a batch of 4+ answers (Ouyang et al., 2022). The resulting data is transformed into a set of prompt-chosen-rejected trios, where the chosen completion is preferred over the rejected completion for training.\\n\\nTraining a reward model involves training a classifier to predict the human preference probability, $p^*$, between two answers, as modeled by a Bradley-Terry model (Bradley and Terry, 1952):\\n\\n$$p^*(y_1 \\\\succ x \\\\mid x) = \\\\frac{\\\\exp(r^*(x, y_1))}{\\\\exp(r^*(x, y_1)) + \\\\exp(r^*(x, y_2))}.$$  \\n\\n(1)\\n\\nThen, estimate the parameters of the RM by optimizing the maximum likelihood loss as follows:\\n\\n$$L(\\\\theta, D) = \\\\mathbb{E}_{(x, y_{\\\\text{chosen}}, y_{\\\\text{rejected}}) \\\\sim D}[\\\\log(\\\\frac{1 + e^{r^*(x, y_2)}}{1 + e^{r^*(x, y_1)}})].$$\\n\\nFor language models, the RM is often implemented by appending a linear layer to predict one logit or removing the final decoding layers and replacing them with a linear layer. At inference time, a trained reward model returns a scalar, such that $P(y_1 \\\\succ y_2 \\\\mid x) \\\\propto e^{r^*(x, y_1)}$ (which intuitively is the probability that the completion would be a preferred response, but is trained indirectly via the pairwise loss). Thus, a win between completions $y_1$ and $y_2$ is achieved when $r^*(x, y_1) > r^*(x, y_2)$.\\n\\n**Direct Preference Optimization**\\n\\nDirect Preference Optimization solves the RLHF problem without needing to learn a separate reward model. It achieves this by reparameterizing the preference-based reward function using only the policy models (Rafailov et al., 2023). The implicit reward used in DPO is a function of the policy model probabilities (i.e. the model being trained), $\\\\pi(y \\\\mid x)$, a regularization constant, $\\\\beta$, the base model probabilities, $\\\\pi_{\\\\text{ref}}(y \\\\mid x)$, and a partition function $Z(x)$:\\n\\n$$r^*(x, y) = \\\\beta \\\\log \\\\frac{\\\\pi(y \\\\mid x)}{\\\\pi_{\\\\text{ref}}(y \\\\mid x)} + \\\\beta \\\\log Z(x).$$\\n\\n(2)\\n\\nGiven two completions to a prompt, we compare the rewards $r^*(x, y_1)$ and $r^*(x, y_2)$ as follows, where the score is computed via the log ratios of $\\\\pi$:\\n\\n$$\\\\log \\\\frac{\\\\pi(y_1 \\\\mid x)}{\\\\pi_{\\\\text{ref}}(y_1 \\\\mid x)} > \\\\log \\\\frac{\\\\pi(y_2 \\\\mid x)}{\\\\pi_{\\\\text{ref}}(y_2 \\\\mid x)}.$$\"}"}

The dataset is designed to provide a broad set of basic evaluations for reward models, covering chat, instruction following, coding, safety, and other important metrics for fine-tuned language models. The REWARD BENCH dataset contains a combination of existing evaluation prompt-completion pairs, and those curated for this project.\\n\\nA good reward function, and therefore a good RM broadly, is one that stably assigns credit to the classes of good or bad content. Given one verified answer that is better than another for factual or clear qualitative reasons (e.g. typos), a good reward model will choose the correct one 100% of the time. To evaluate this, each datapoint consists of a prompt and two completions, chosen and rejected. For each prompt, the score of the reward model is computed. The prompt is then categorized as a win if the score of the prompt with the verified chosen completion is higher than that of the verified rejected completion, as shown in Fig. 1. Finally, we report accuracy for each subset as the percentage of wins. For all the section scores of REWARD BENCH except Prior Sets, the average score is weighted per-prompt in the requisite subsets.\\n\\n4.1 REWARD BENCH Dataset\\n\\nThe benchmark is broken down into five sections from different subsets \u2013 the first four compose the REWARD BENCH dataset described in this section. We have broken down the dataset into these subsections to create one final REWARD BENCH score in order to reasonably weigh different aspects of an RM's performance. The RewardBench dataset is released under the ODC-BY license and the code is released under Apache 2.0. The summary of the dataset is shown in Tab. 1 (see appendix F for full details). At a high level, the subsets consist of the following:\\n\\n1. Chat: Testing a reward model's basic ability to distinguish a thorough and correct chat response in open-ended generation. Prompts and chosen, rejected pairs are selected from AlpacaEval (Li et al., 2023b) and MT Bench (Zheng et al., 2023), two popular open-ended chat evaluation tools.\\n\\n2. Chat Hard: Testing a reward model's abilities to understand trick questions and subtly different instruction responses. Prompts and chosen, rejected pairs are selected from MT Bench exam-ples with similar ratings and adversarial data specifically for fooling LLM-as-a-judge tools from LLMBar's evaluation set (Zeng et al., 2023) (reformatted for RMs).\\n\\n3. Safety: Testing the models' tendencies to refuse dangerous content and to avoid incorrect refusals to similar trigger words. Prompts and chosen, rejected pairs are selected from custom versions of the datasets XSTest (R\u00f6ttger et al., 2023), Do-Not-Answer (Wang et al., 2023), and examples from an in-development refusals dataset at AI2, where the chosen response is a refusal and the rejected is harmful text of either dangerous or offensive nature.\\n\\n4. Reasoning: Evaluating the models code and reasoning abilities. Code prompts are created by reformatting HumanEvalPack examples with correct code as chosen and rejected as one with bugs (Muennighoff et al., 2023). Reasoning prompts pair reference answers with incorrect model generations from the PRM800k dataset (Lightman et al., 2023).\\n\\n5. Prior Sets: For consistency with recent work on training reward models, we average performance over test sets from existing preference datasets. We use the Anthropic Helpful split (Bai et al., 2022a) (the only multi-turn data), the Anthropic HHH subset of BIG-Bench (Askell et al., 2021), a curated subset of the test set from the Stanford Human Preferences (SHP) Dataset (Ethayarajh et al., 2022), and OpenAI's Learning to Summarize Dataset (Stiennon et al., 2020).\\n\\nFor the final RewardBench score, we weigh the Prior Sets category at 0.5 weight of the others due to multiple factors: noise, lack of clearly defined tasks, etc. The dataset is found here: https://huggingface.co/datasets/allenai/preference-test-sets.\"}"}

For each prompt-chosen-rejected trio, we infer the score the RM assigns for the prompt-chosen and prompt-rejected pairs then assign a true classification label when the chosen score is higher than rejected, as highlighted in Fig. 1. Details on computing scores for classifiers and DPO models is in Sec. 3. Given the binary classification task, a random model achieves a result of 50%. In order to create a representative, single evaluation score, we perform a mixture of averaging across results. For the sections detailed in Sec. 4.1 except for Reasoning, we perform per-prompt weighted averaging across the subsets to get the normalized section scores. For example, in Chat we take a weighted average of the AlpacaEval and MT Bench sets based on the number of prompts. For Reasoning, we increase the weight of the PRM-Math subset so code and math abilities are weighed equally in the final number. For Prior Sets, we take an unweighted average over the subsets due to the large disparity in dataset sizes. Once all subsets weighted averages are achieved, the final WARD BENCH score is the weighted average across the section scores (Prior Sets at 0.5 weight).\\n\\n5 Evaluation Results\\n\\nWARD BENCH includes evaluation of many public reward models, ranging in parameter count from 400 million (PairRM) to 70 billion (Tulu 2), trained as classifiers or with DPO (when the reference model is available). In this section, we detail the core findings of WARD BENCH, and more results are available in Appendix E. In particular, we study the state-of-the-art reward models (Tab. 2), results of similar-size models at 7B (Tab. 4), and a demonstration of the impact of scaling DPO reward models on performance in Tab. 3. We further study the limits of current reward models (Section 5.2) and prior test sets (Section 5.3).\"}"}

Large models and those trained on Llama 3 are the only models capable of high performance on the Chat Hard and Reasoning sections, with the model ArmoRM-Llama3-8B-v0.1 (89) being state-of-the-art. Across different base models, scale is a crucial property, with Starling-RM-34B (81.4) trained on Yi 34B and Tulu-2-DPO-70B (76.1) on Llama 2 being top models. The best open-weight models for LLM-as-a-judge are Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct (75.4) and prometheus-8x7b-v2.0 (75.3) (Kim et al., 2024), though they still fall well below classifier-based RMs. The final category is comprised of the small, most accessible models, where the leading models are StableLM-zephyr-3b (70.6) and oasst-rm-2.1-pythia-1.4b-epoch-2.5 (69.5), but there is substantial room for progress.\\n\\nThe Impacts of Different Base Models\\n\\nIn our evaluation there are multiple models trained either with the same or very similar fine-tuning approaches on different base models. We show the impact of scaling across different Llama 2, via Tulu 2 (Ivison et al., 2023), and Qwen 1.5 versions in Tab. 3. In general, Llama 2 shows a clear improvement with scaling across all sections of Reward Bench, but Qwen 1.5 shows less monotonic improvement, likely due to out of distribution generalization challenges. Tab. 4 compares the impact of different base models and subtle changes of fine-tuning methods via the Zephyr-class models (Tunstall et al., 2023). Each of these models are fine-tuned on the UltraFeedback dataset via DPO as the final stage, with different base models and instruction-tuning before.\\n\\nDifferent Shapes of Reward Functions\\n\\nThe per-prompt scores demonstrate the different magnitudes and distributions of rewards assigned to each reward model over the Reward Bench evaluation dataset. Results shown in Appendix E.1, such as Fig. 7, show these distributions for some RMs trained as a classifier. Few RMs are Gaussian in their scores across the Reward Bench datasets, fewer RMs are centered around 0 reward, and none we tested centered Gaussians. Future work should identify a preferred RM output distribution for downstream RL training.\\n\\n5.2 Limits of Current Reward Models\\n\\nCurrent reward models can solve some subsets of Reward Bench reliably, approaching 100% accuracy, but many subsets experience a combination of low ceilings on performance or high variance of performance. The subsets with low ceilings, mostly in the Chat Hard and Reasoning sections, indicate areas where preference datasets and reward modeling methods can be extended to improve performance, and subsets with high variability, such as many of the Safety subsets, indicate areas where best practices can be converged upon.\"}"}

The adversarial subsets from LLMBar (Zeng et al., 2023) are crucial to understanding RMs because they show examples where two answers are written in a similar style (e.g. the same GPT-4 model version), but with slightly different subjects. The difference between asking a factual question about a related but different object or slightly changing the context of a prompt, is hard to pick up with most reward models. The Chat Hard section (and to some extent Reasoning) is largely correlated with final performance, but some DPO models excel at it and not overall \u2013 even Qwen Chat and others with low average performance overall. The models scoring highly largely are trained on recent base models and preference datasets, showcasing recent progress on RM training.\\n\\n### Evaluating across Reasoning Categories\\nThe Reasoning section of REWARD BENCH has the widest, smooth variation in performance \u2013 e.g. models populate many levels, from 35% accuracy (well below random) all the way to 97% accuracy. The reasoning data largely relies on code exam-ples where just one or two tokens are different between the chosen and rejected samples, showcasing precise classification abilities of the best RMs. Full reasoning results are included in Tab. 13.\\n\\n### Evaluating across Safety Metrics\\nTab. 6 (full results in Tab. 12 in Appendix) compares different reward models across different safety categories, indicating challenges on striking a balance between refusing too much or not refusing. Models, such as UltraRM-13b and zephyr-7b-gemma-v0.1\"}"}

Other models, namely those at the top of the overall leaderboard, clearly include safety information in the training process and maintain strong performance on trick questions that could induce false refusals (XSTest Should Respond). Finally, the mirrored behavior, those models that score highly on prompts that they should refuse and poorly on those they should not are present, indicating a model that is likely to falsely refusal queries (e.g. the Qwen chat models). These three behavior modes indicate that REWARD BENCHMARK can be used as a quick check of the safety behavior of a candidate model, especially when trained with DPO (as it will not need further RL training like the classifiers).\\n\\n5.3 Limitations of Prior Test Sets\\nMany popular models trained with RLHF use new preference datasets such as UltraFeedback (Cui et al., 2023) or Nectar (Zhu et al., 2023a), which don't have publicly available validation sets. Given this, when training reward models, common practice is to compare model agreement with a variety of existing test sets from earlier work in RLHF. Some models scoring strongly on the Prior Sets section of REWARD BENCHMARK, such as UltraRM-13b and PairRM-hf were trained on the training splits of Anthropic HH, Stanford Human Preferences (SHP), and OpenAI's Learning to Summarize, but other top classifier models, such as the Starling models were not. Combining this with the very low average score of DPO models on these test sets indicates that substantial research is needed to understand the full limitations of these previous datasets. Full results are detailed in Tab. 14.\\n\\n6 Conclusion\\nWe present REWARD BENCHMARK, and show the variety of performance characteristics of current reward models in order to improve understanding of RLHF. While we covered a variety of topics important to alignment of LMs, a crucial next step is needed to correlate performance in REWARD BENCHMARK to RLHF usefulness. Initial experiments with ranking RMs with best-of-N sampling and downstream training with PPO are underway. We have taken a first step to understanding which values are embedded in the RLHF training across many base models and preference datasets. The toolkit we have released can easily be expanded include custom data to specifically audit a certain property of the RLHF process.

First, we lack human preference data and instead, except for specific subsets, have to rely on semi-automatic ways of obtaining chosen-rejected pairs, which we then manually validate. We also note that the formats in certain domains, such as the reasoning domain, might potentially include spurious correlations leading to possible biases in humans and models. Another unresolved question is whether and how the benchmark results correlate with downstream training. Lastly, there might be a chance of possible data contamination, in cases where models are (wrongly) directly trained on alpacaeval or MTBench data.\\n\\nBroader Impacts\\n\\nThis work does expose potentially offensive and or sensitive text to users through the rejected samples of the Safety section of the benchmark. Therefore users should use this data at their own risk. Given the preexisting prompts from other benchmarks, we are not worried about eliciting personally identifiable information.\\n\\nDiscussions\\n\\nEvaluating Length Bias\\n\\nGiven the results showing length bias in RLHF and reward models (Singhal et al., 2023), we designed REWARD BENCH so that the chosen responses are either a similar length or shorter than the rejected responses. For example, the AlpacaEval Length subset is designed to differentiate between other Chat subsets by having notably different models capabilities with the same average length (results in Tab. 10). In this case, the results are lower than other easy chat subsets, but 90% plus accuracy is achieved by over 10 models \u2013 far above random for most models. Though, more detailed statistical tests are needed to fully understand this, as this only tests the reward models\u2019 abilities to discern information without the help of length as a proxy. More details on the length distributions of REWARD BENCH are found in Appendix H.2.\\n\\nDPO Models vs Classifiers\\n\\nSince DPO-trained LLMs are implicit reward models largely used for their generative abilities, the question of how they compare to RMs trained as classifiers is unstudied. There are currently more DPO models released to the public, partially due to DPO requiring notably fewer computational resources among other factors such as existing implementations and relevant datasets. We see that the results on REWARD BENCH flatter the recent DPO methods, except for the Prior Sets section. For how the DPO reward is computed, see Sec. 3. The same inference code of popular DPO training implementations can easily be used for evaluation as an RM by not propagating gradients through the models. The simplest implementations requires more GPU memory to run evaluation of DPO-trained models given the two models needed to compute the reward, but this can be avoided by computing the probabilities over the policy and base models sequentially. Though, some of the released DPO models do not clearly document which reference model is used in training (e.g. if it is a base model or a model obtained via supervised fine-tuning), which can result in unclear benchmarking. When a reference model is unavailable or compute is constrained, an alternative approach in such cases would be to obtain a reference free reward:\\n\\n$$\\\\pi(y_1|x) > \\\\pi(y_2|x)$$,\\n\\nwhich could be normalized using different approaches. Without normalization, the loss has a length penalty by summing over probabilities of each token which are all negative numbers. We will explore the impacts of reference free inference in future work. We also experimented with using the \u201cwrong\u201d reference model, i.e. a similar but different base model, and found that this reduced the DPO trained RM performance to similar levels as the random baseline.\\n\\nThere is still a lot that is unknown about the best practices of training RMs: trained with DPO they are regularized by KL distance, but the classifiers are not.

Given LLM-as-a-judge's prevalent use for evaluation, recent works have emerged using LLMs as feedback mechanisms very similar to reward models. Some works have fine-tuned models specifically for the task of rating or choosing responses from LLMs (Jiang et al., 2023b; Kim et al., 2023; Zhu et al., 2023b). Others use the policy LM itself as a generative reward model via prompting it to behave as a judge (Yuan et al., 2024b; Li et al., 2023a). While similar to the reward computation of DPO models, this mode of score calculation...\"}"}

Results are shown in Tab. 8 where there is a substantial variation among existing open and closed models. Note, the best classifier RMs outperform the best generative reward models.\\n\\nValues Represented in Reward Models\\n\\nReward models inhabit an important normative role in the RLHF process being the primary artifact where human preferences or values are encoded in the final policy. The R\\\\textsubscript{EWARD}B\\\\textsubscript{ENCH} infrastructure enables asking basic questions when studying reward models such as whose or which values are embedded as the sense of reward (Lambert et al., 2023). Initial work is studying this question for LLMs broadly, such as measuring representation (Durmus et al., 2023; Ryan et al., 2024) or moral foundations of LMs (Abdulhai et al., 2023), but this work should be extended to reward models. This can involve the study of different base models which RMs are trained from, tweaking fine-tuning techniques, if synthetic datasets amplify bias in RMs as well (Wyllie et al., 2024), and datasets.\\n\\nSafety In or After RLHF\\n\\nAn emerging trend in LLMs is the shift from chat systems being only a model to being a system of models, with small models used as classifiers for tasks such as safety (Mozes et al., 2023). If some LLMs or RMs are designed to be used with additional safety classifiers after the fact, evaluating them on R\\\\textsubscript{EWARD}B\\\\textsubscript{ENCH} may not be a fair comparison. For systems such as this, each classifier for a specific task should be evaluated on the sections it controls. The most common area where this is handled is safety, where a small reward model can be used to permit or block all outputs from a larger generating model.\\n\\nC Compute Usage\\n\\nThis work primarily evaluates models on NVIDIA A100 GPUs hosted by Cirrascale. Each model, of which we evaluated 75, takes about 12 hours to run on 16 bit quantization. Re-running the entire evaluation suite of RewardBench would take approximately 1000 A100 hours to complete.\\n\\nD Codebase Discussion\\n\\nAdditional data is included in the code-base, but not included in the evaluation score due to noisy results or lack of clear use instructions (e.g. could be easy for unintentional test-set contamination). In this vein, results on SafeRLHF (Dai et al., 2023) data and MT Bench labels (from humans and GPT-4) are supported within the methodology, but not included in this analysis.\\n\\nE Additional Results\\n\\nTable 9 shows the full results for the first reward models we collected in this work. In addition, Tables 10-14 provides the performance breakdown per category.\\n\\nTable 9: Leaderboard results in R\\\\textsubscript{EWARD}B\\\\textsubscript{ENCH}.

The subsets created for REdwardBench show substantial higher variance and range than the existing test sets used to evaluate reward models. A higher range of evaluation signal indicates that the benchmark makes it easier to differentiate between two similar models. Important subsets to REdwardBench are those with maximum performance below 100%, indicating potential future work.\\n\\nFigure 2: Distribution of scores for the subsets in the REdwardBench Dataset for the first 42 models collected in this work. In a violin plot, the median is shown in white, with the first interquartile range as the thick line, and 1.5\u00d7 range as the thin line. There is a large variety of score distributions within the REdwardBench dataset, and they cover wider ranges than those in prior preference sets (shown in Fig. 3.\\n\\nE.2 Model Reward Distributions\\n\\nAn interesting detail that is not yet easy to apply to training better RLHF models is the shape of the distribution of given reward models on the same input dataset. For all the datasets tested in REdwardBench, we record the outputted scores for every prompt. The outputs of models trained with DPO are all large negative numbers given they are summations of logprobs across the generation. The outputs of reward models trained as a simple classifier should in concept be near to a unit Gaussian given desirable properties of a reward function for RL algorithms, but this is normally not the case.\"}"}
