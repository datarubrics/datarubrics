After carefully reviewing sample conversations, we found many potentially harmful conversations that were not flagged by the OpenAI moderation API (see examples in Appendix B.1). This, along with potential reluctance to share sensitive user data with external moderation services, motivates the need to explore methods for developing one's own safety moderation model.\\n\\nWe fine-tune a content moderation model using Vicuna-7B (Zheng et al., 2023). Instead of developing a classifier, we fine-tune a language model to generate explanations for why a particular message was flagged, based on the system prompt described in the moderation task (see Appendix B.2). We focus on the five categories of OpenAI's moderation API and select the top 1K flagged messages for each category from LMSYS-Chat-1M. To ensure a balanced label distribution, we include a random selection of 1K normal messages. We use GPT-4 to generate an explanation for each message as the training data. Additionally, we incorporate 3K conversations from ShareGPT to enhance the diversity of our training dataset.\\n\\nTo evaluate the models, we create a challenging benchmark by carefully selecting 110 toxic messages from LMSYS-Chat-1M that are not flagged by OpenAI moderation API (005) and manually label them. The evaluation set contains approximately 20 conversations per category and includes 25 non-toxic messages. It is noteworthy that a message might have multiple labels assigned to it.\\n\\nWe evaluate the 0-shot and 1-shot micro-F1 accuracy of several models on this benchmark. With a system prompt presenting detailed explanations on moderation categories (see Appendix B.2), we prompt each model to determine whether a message could be categorized accordingly. The results are presented in Table 3. We observe a significant improvement (30%) when transitioning from Vicuna-7B to the fine-tuned Vicuna-moderator-7B, underscoring the effectiveness of fine-tuning. Furthermore, Vicuna-moderator-7B surpasses GPT-3.5-turbo's performance and matches that of GPT-4. The inclusion of a one-shot example can notably enhance performance: the performance of many models saw significant improvement with the addition of a one-shot example. Note that we did not conduct extensive one-shot prompt tuning and leave it for future study.\\n\\nSurprisingly, we observe that Llama-2-7B-chat and Claude-2 obtain significantly lower scores than other models. This is because Llama-2-7B-chat refuses nearly all the given moderation tasks, likely due to being overcautious about harmful content and missing the context (R\u00f6ttger et al., 2023). Similarly, Claude-2 also declines to complete some tasks, resulting in a lower score. We show some examples in Appendix B.3.\"}"}

Our findings, presented in Table 4, show that open-source models without safety measures tend to generate flagged content more frequently than proprietary ones. Nonetheless, we still observe \u201cjailbreak\u201d successes on proprietary models like GPT-4 and Claude, as shown in the example conversations in Appendix B.4.\\n\\nTo evaluate a model\u2019s vulnerability to jailbreak attacks, we compile a collection of jailbreak attempts.

We then submit the model\u2019s responses to these jailbreak prompts to the OpenAI moderation API for a safety evaluation.\\n\\nTable 5 shows the success rate of jailbreak for several representative LLMs. We can see Llama-2 and Claude being the safest model against jailbreak and open models without safety-related training (Alpaca and Vicuna) are more vulnerable. We believe the 1M conversations dataset can be further used to improve existing safety measures and explore various research topics on AI harmlessness.\\n\\n4.3 Training Instruction-Following Models\\n\\nIt is a common belief that the diversity and quality of instruction-following datasets are crucial for effective instruction fine-tuning. This is evident in the success of ShareGPT, which is among the best datasets for this purpose and led to the creation of the Vicuna model (Chiang et al., 2023). Here, we study whether subsets from LMSYS-Chat-1M can be used to train a competent instruction-following model and then compare its performance with Vicuna trained on ShareGPT.\\n\\nWe extract two subsets. The first, named \u201cHighQuality,\u201d uses 45K conversations from OpenAI and Anthropic\u2019s models. The second, named \u201cUpvote\u201d, selects 39K conversations based on user votes from open models, without any data from proprietary models. We fine-tune Llama2-7B (Touvron et al., 2023b) on these two subsets and get two models \u201cHighQuality-7B\u201d and \u201cUpvote-7B.\u201d\\n\\nThe evaluation results are shown in Table 6. It shows that the performance of HighQuality-7B is only slightly worse than that of Vicuna-7B. This suggests that the quality of prompts in LMSYS-Chat-1M is similar to that of ShareGPT, emphasizing its value. On the other hand, the performance of Upvote-7B is markedly lower than its distilled counterparts, indicating that the quality of answers from open models is still lacking. We posit that by smartly selecting prompts from the entire LMSYS-Chat-1M\"}"}

Most existing benchmarks are domain-specific (e.g., reading comprehension), but real-world tasks often require the integration of diverse skills such as problem-solving, creativity, knowledge, and common sense. Developing benchmarks that evaluate this broad set of skills remains an open challenge. The diverse prompts collected from real users in LMSYS-Chat-1M offer a valuable resource for creating such benchmarks.\\n\\nDefining what constitutes \u201cchallenging\u201d prompts is essential in crafting benchmark questions. While there are many definitions that could address topics ranging from ethical and philosophical reasoning to problem-solving and information retrieval. Here, we consider a prompt to be challenging if it requires integrating various knowledge and skills to derive appropriate responses. For instance, \u201cCan you explain gravity to a 10-year-old with a simple example\u201d requires LLMs to explain complex concepts in simple terms and their adherence to real-world facts. In contrast to good prompts such as examples in Appendix B.5, trivial prompts such as examples in Appendix B.6 are either too straightforward or narrow.\\n\\nWe start with a subset of LMSYS-Chat-1M that is collected from Chatbot Arena. It contains conversations where users compare two LLMs against each other and indicate which model responds better. Such human judgments provide useful signals for examining the quality of benchmark prompts.\\n\\nAll numbers are computed by InstructEval (Chia et al., 2023). The results may not exactly match other evaluation frameworks.\"}"}

We also present the MT-Bench scores and observe a larger performance gap between open and proprietary models with Arena-Hard-200.\\n\\nAn open question is how to select useful and challenging prompts from the noisy crowdsourced user conversations. Here, we propose a simple technique that uses LLM to classify whether the prompt is a good prompt for benchmarking. We carefully design an instruction and ask GPT-3.5-Turbo to assign a score from 1 to 10, in which a higher score represents a greater potential to evaluate the LLMs in problem-solving, creativity, and truthfulness. We find such a technique can effectively filter out trivial or ambiguous user prompts. The detailed system prompt and few-shot examples can be found in Appendix B.7. In Figure 4, we show the score distribution tagged by GPT-3.5-Turbo.\\n\\nTo examine whether the scores are effective, we design an ablation study where we compare responses of a stronger model (e.g., GPT-4) against a baseline like GPT-3.5-Turbo. We sample two subsets of 50 prompts from the top-score (>8) and bottom-score (<2) prompts and their associated user votes. In Table 5, we find GPT-4 wins 52% in Top-50 but only 22% in Bottom-50 against GPT-3.5-Turbo, suggesting Top-50 prompt set is much more effective in benchmarking models.\\n\\nBased on this methodology, we identified the 200 most challenging prompts that get 9+ score agreed by GPT-3.5-Turbo, Claude-2, and GPT-4. Manual inspection confirms their superior quality (see examples in Appendix B.8). We then create a benchmark, Arena-Hard-200, to evaluate cutting-edge LLMs in the field. We score each model's answer with GPT-4 as judge approach (Zheng et al., 2023). In Figure 6, Arena-Hard-200 effectively ranks models and reveals larger performance gaps between open and proprietary models (e.g., GPT-4, Claude) than MT-Bench (Zheng et al., 2023), suggesting more rooms for open models to catch up in this challenging real-world task set.\\n\\nWe believe more research on LLM evaluation can be developed with this dataset (e.g., better categorization on user prompts, study selection bias of LLM graders) and leave them for future study.\\n\\n4.5 OTHER USE CASES\\n\\nThis dataset can be used for additional research topics beyond the four use cases we demonstrated.

In this paper, we introduce LMSYS-Chat-1M, a large-scale dataset containing one million real-world conversations with 25 state-of-the-art LLMs. This dataset is collected from 210K unique IP addresses in the wild on our Vicuna demo and Chatbot Arena website. We offer an overview of the dataset\u2019s content, including its curation process, basic statistics, and topic distribution, highlighting its diversity, originality, and scale. We demonstrate its versatility through four use cases: developing content moderation models that perform similarly to GPT-4, building a safety benchmark, training instruction-following models that perform similarly to Vicuna, and creating challenging benchmark questions. We believe that this dataset will serve as a valuable resource for understanding and advancing LLM capabilities. The dataset is publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/lmsys/lmsys-chat-1m.\\n\\nINTRODUCTION\\nFrom virtual assistants (OpenAI, 2023a; Bai et al., 2022b; Touvron et al., 2023b; Anil et al., 2023) to code generation (Chen et al., 2021; Li et al., 2022; Rozi\u00e8re et al., 2023), large language models (LLMs) have permeated much of modern AI and are central to most human-AI interactions. As a consequence, there is a pressing need to study the interaction between humans and LLM technology. For example, as users engage with LLMs, they change their behaviors by adopting domain-specific queries and question formats. Unraveling these patterns can offer insights into user expectations and trust regarding different LLMs. Beyond general behavior, understanding the spectrum of questions\u2014ranging from simple factual queries to complex, context-heavy questions\u2014can improve LLMs to cater better to user needs, avoid misuse, and improve AI safety.\\n\\nHowever, studying these topics requires access to a dataset of diverse, real-user queries posted to different LLMs. Unfortunately, such a dataset remains elusive in the research community, for the following reasons. First, the operational costs associated with hosting an LLM service are prohibitively high for most entities. Second, wealthy commercial LLM vendors, despite having a vast amount of user queries, often hold back from disclosing the dataset, due to competitive concerns and the proprietary nature of the data. Third, there is an inherent difficulty in incentivizing users to interact with multiple, open LLMs, due to their lackluster performance compared to commercial models, which adds difficulty to creating such a large-scale multi-LLM conversation dataset.\\n\\nTo bridge this gap, this paper introduces the first large-scale, real-world LLM conversation dataset, LMSYS-Chat-1M. The dataset is curated from a larger set of LLM-user interaction data we collected by hosting a free, online LLM service. The service serves 25 popular LLMs, including both\"}"}

To maintain continuous user interest over time, we created a gamified platform Chatbot Arena (Zheng et al., 2023) and incentivized users to use our service by regularly releasing the leaderboards of popular LLMs. As a result, LMSYS-Chat-1M contains over 1 million user conversations with a rich diversity of languages and topics. User consent for this dataset is obtained through the \u201cTerms of use\u201d section on the data collection website. To ensure the safe release of data, we have also made our best effort to remove personal identification information and flag unsafe and toxic contents, but keep the original conversations to facilitate future studies on LLM safety.\\n\\nTo shed light on future studies on LLM-user interactions, in this paper, we apply LMSYS-Chat-1M on four use cases and demonstrate its potential. In particular, we show that LMSYS-Chat-1M can be used to fine-tune existing small LLMs as powerful content moderators, with performance on par with GPT-4 (subsection 4.1). Even though some served models are trained to be safe, LMSYS-Chat-1M still contains numerous user conversations that can jailbreak the safeguards of leading LLMs (including GPT-4 and Claude). We repurpose these data as a new, challenging benchmark for LLM robustness and safety study (subsection 4.2). In addition, LMSYS-Chat-1M also contains high-quality user-LLM dialogues ideal for instruction fine-tuning. To show this, we have curated a subset of these dialogues to fine-tune Llama-2 models, resulting in a similar level of performance to Vicuna and Llama2 Chat on MMLU and MT-bench (subsection 4.3). Finally, the expansive range of topics and tasks covered by LMSYS-Chat-1M can serve as a foundation for generating new LLM benchmark questions. We propose a simple technique to extract challenging task prompts from the conversation data. We then curate a new benchmark, Arena-Hard-200, the 200 most challenging and high-quality user prompts extracted, which effectively identifies the gap between the proprietary and open models in real-world scenarios (subsection 4.4).\\n\\nWe make the following contributions in this paper:\\n\\n\u2022 We introduce the first large-scale real-world LLM conversation dataset, LMSYS-Chat-1M, which contains 1 million user conversations with different LLMs.\\n\u2022 We analyze the dataset and visualize the distribution of user queries.\\n\u2022 We demonstrate four exemplary use cases leveraging LMSYS-Chat-1M: developing content moderation models, building a safety benchmark, training instruction-following models, and creating challenging benchmark questions. Additionally, we suggest other potential use cases and studies based on it.\\n\\nDATASET\\n\\nLMSYS-Chat-1M is collected on our website from April to August 2023. The website offers three types of chat interfaces: Single model, Chatbot Arena (battle), and Chatbot Arena (side-by-side). By selecting one interface, a user can choose to chat with a single model, chat with two randomly selected anonymous models side-by-side, or chat with two self-selected models side-by-side. The screenshots of interfaces are included in Appendix A. The dataset contains conversations from all interfaces. On the website, users are required to accept the terms of use, which gives us their consent and allows us to release conversation data. The platform is free of charge; we neither pay users nor impose any fees on them. Furthermore, any user can access the platform without needing to register. The code for this website is publicly available.\\n\\nWe utilize dozens of A100 GPUs to host our website, serving a total of 25 models over the course of the timespan. The dataset contains raw conversation text without any processing. To ensure the safe release of data, we have made our best efforts to remove conversations that contain personally identifiable information (PII). In addition, we have included the OpenAI moderation API output for each message. However, we have chosen to keep unsafe conversations intact so that researchers can study the safety-related questions associated with LLM usage in real-world scenarios.\\n\\n1 https://huggingface.co/spaces/lmsys/chatbot-arena-leaderboard\\n2 https://chat.lmsys.org\\n3 https://github.com/lm-sys/FastChat/tree/v0.2.26#serving-with-web-gui\"}"}

Each sample includes a conversation ID, model name, conversation text in OpenAI API JSON format, detected language tag, and OpenAI moderation API tag. Basic statistics for this and some other similar datasets are in Table 1. Among the available datasets, LMSYS-Chat-1M stands out for its large scale, multi-model coverage, and diversity. Figure 1 shows the conversation count for each model, where the top five models are Vicuna (Zheng et al., 2023), Koala (Geng et al., 2023), Alpaca (Taori et al., 2023), ChatGLM (Du et al., 2022), and Llama (Touvron et al., 2023a;b). Vicuna receives the most conversations because it is the default model on our website. Although most conversations are with Vicuna, we think the prompts alone are already highly valuable and one can use other models to regenerate answers if needed. Figure 1 shows the number of conversations in each language, where the top five languages are English, Portuguese, Russian, Chinese, and Spanish. The languages are automatically detected by the Polyglot package.\\n\\n3.2 Topic Distribution\\nWe conduct a topic distribution analysis on user prompts by applying a clustering algorithm. From 100K randomly sampled English conversations, we extract user prompts, which include both the initial and follow-up turns. We remove prompts that are either too short (fewer than 32 characters) or too long (more than 1536 characters). Next, we compute the sentence embeddings of these prompts using the all-mpnet-base-v2 model from SentenceTransformers (Reimers & Gurevych, 2019). We then employ k-means clustering to form 20 clusters. For each cluster, we choose 100 prompts closest to the centroid and ask GPT-4 to provide a summary of their central topic.\\n\\nThe results are displayed in Figure 3. The majority of questions are related to coding and software (Clusters 1, 2, 6, 16, 18). A similar result was also found in a survey about ChatGPT users, which found that programming is the most common use case (Fishkin, 2023). Additionally, there is a significant number of unsafe topics (Cluster 9, 15, 17). The remaining clusters represent other typical uses, such as general knowledge, business inquiries, and writing assistance.\"}"}

Because this dataset contains a non-trivial amount of unfiltered unsafe conversations, it can serve as a rich resource for examining safety issues of LLMs (Ganguli et al., 2022; Wei et al., 2023; Shen et al., 2023; Zou et al., 2023; Bhardwaj & Poria, 2023). We utilize the OpenAI moderation API to tag all conversations. This API assigns scores to each message based on various violation categories. A conversation is deemed to contain unsafe content if any of its messages is flagged by the API. The statistics related to these categorizations can be found in Table 2. These statistics indicate that a non-negligible portion (5%) of the conversations have potentially harmful content. However, it's important to note that the recall of this API may be low (see subsection 4.1), leading us to expect even more harmful content within the entire dataset.\\n\\nWe show four use cases of our dataset: developing content moderation models, building a safety benchmark, training instruction-following models, and creating challenging benchmark questions.\\n\\n4 https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/moderation\"}"}

I'll be buying some more fruit, and I want to have an equal 50/50 ratio of apples to oranges. If I'm going to buy exactly 4500 pieces of fruit on top of what I started with, how many apples should I buy and how many oranges should I buy?\\n\\nLet's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer.\\n\\nGPT-3.5-Turbo:\\nGreat! Let's start by finding the total number of apples and oranges you want to have after buying the additional fruit. To have a 50/50 ratio of apples to oranges, we need to have an equal number of each. Since we currently have 4000 apples and 2500 oranges, we need to add the same number of each to reach a total of 8500 pieces of fruit. So, we need to add (8500 - 4000 - 2500) = 2000 more pieces of each fruit.\\n\\nNow, let's find out how many apples and oranges you should buy to get the desired ratio. Since we want to have an equal number of apples and oranges, we can divide the total number of additional fruits needed by 2. So, we need to buy 1000 more apples and 1000 more oranges to reach the desired ratio.\\n\\nTherefore, the final number of apples you should have is 4000 + 1000 = 5000, and the final number of oranges you should have is 2500 + 1000 = 3500.\\n\\nGPT-4:\\nStep 1: Determine the total number of apples and oranges you want to have in the end. Since you want a 50/50 ratio of apples to oranges, the total number of apples should be equal to the total number of oranges. Step 2: Calculate the total number of fruits you will have after buying 4500 more. You currently have 4000 apples + 2500 oranges = 6500 fruits. After buying 4500 more fruits, you will have 6500 + 4500 = 11000 fruits. Step 3: Divide the total number of fruits by 2 to find the desired number of apples and oranges. Since you want a 50/50 ratio, you should have 11000 fruits / 2 = 5500 apples and 5500 oranges. Step 4: Calculate how many apples and oranges you need to buy. To reach 5500 apples, you need to buy 5500 - 4000 = 1500 apples. To reach 5500 oranges, you need to buy 5500 - 2500 = 3000 oranges. So, you should buy 1500 apples and 3000 oranges to achieve a 50/50 ratio of apples to oranges.\\n\\nGPT-3.5-Turbo Assessment:\\n1. Assess the Potential: This prompt is an excellent test of the AI's problem-solving skills. It requires the AI to perform calculations and find a solution that satisfies the given conditions. The AI needs to determine the number of apples and oranges to buy in order to achieve a 50/50 ratio, given the initial quantities and the total number of fruits to be bought.\\n2. Assign a Score: This prompt has a high potential to assess the AI's problem-solving skills effectively. It requires logical thinking and mathematical calculations. Therefore, I would assign a score of 9.\\n\\nArena User Vote:\\nGPT-4 is better.\\n\\nThe correct answer is you need to buy 1500 apples and 3000 oranges.

Martin's A Song of Fire and Ice\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nConstructed languages, or conlangs, have been employed by authors across various literary works to enhance the immersive experience of their fictional worlds. Two such prominent works are J.R.R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings and George R.R. Martin's A Song of Fire and Ice, which feature unique conlangs such as Sindarin, Quenya, and Dothraki. This essay aims to compare and contrast the cultural and linguistic aspects of these conlangs, using eight academic sources to support the analysis.\\n\\nCultural Differences\\n\\nTolkien's conlangs, Sindarin and Quenya, were developed to represent the cultures of the Elves in Middle Earth (Fimi and Higgins 2). They are heavily influenced by Tolkien's passion for linguistics and philology, particularly his love for Old Norse and Finnish (Shippey 27). The poetic, romantic nature of the Elvish languages reflects the refined and sophisticated culture of the Elves, who are portrayed as wise and artistic beings (Hammond and Scull 35).\\n\\nWorks Cited\\n\\nFimi, Dimitra, and Andrew Higgins.

For instance, everyday users or individuals from different professions might interact with the LLMs in varied ways. Consequently, results derived from this dataset might not generalize across all user groups.\\n\\n\u2022 Containing repeated and low-quality data: The lack of user registration and data filtering can result in a significant amount of low-quality and duplicate data. However, we choose to not apply any filtering on purpose to reflect the real-world distribution.\\n\\n\u2022 No human preference annotations: This dataset contains raw conversations without any human preference annotations. While our website does collect some user votes, we plan to examine the quality further before releasing them. We encourage the community to check the human preference data released in (Zheng et al., 2023).\\n\\n6 RELATED WORK\\nThe study of conversation has long been a central research topic in natural language processing, and large-scale datasets are indispensable for advancing this field. With the emergence of LLMs, the conversational abilities of AI have reached unprecedented levels. As a result, conversations with LLMs tend to be more comprehensive, spanning a broader and deeper array of topics. This necessitates the creation and use of datasets with greater scale and diverse topic coverage.\\n\\nPublicly available datasets most similar to LMSYS-Chat-1M include the Anthropic Helpfulness and Harmlessness dataset (Bai et al., 2022a), OpenAssistant conversations (K\u00f6pf et al., 2023), and Chatbot Arena conversations (Zheng et al., 2023). Their differences are discussed in section 3. There are also human preference datasets derived from discussion websites, such as Stanford SHP (Ethayarajh et al., 2022) from Reddit and H4StackExchange (Lambert et al., 2023) from StackExchange. Different from these datasets, LMSYS-Chat-1M contains conversations with LLMs and the users of our website are aware that they are chatting with LLMs. Besides these natural conversations, there are synthetic datasets fully generated by LLMs, such as UltraChat (Ding et al., 2023), Baize (Xu et al., 2023b), Camel (Li et al., 2023), Alpaca (Taori et al., 2023), and SODA (Kim et al., 2022). Different from these synthetic datasets, the questions in LMSYS-Chat-1M are generated by human users.\\n\\nBefore the LLM era, several conversation datasets existed, such as UbuntuDialogue (Lowe et al., 2015), DailyDialog (Li et al., 2017), Persona-Chat (Zhang et al., 2018), MultiWOZ (Budzianowski et al., 2018), EmpatheticDialogues (Rashkin et al., 2019), and CoQA (Reddy et al., 2019). Unlike these datasets, LMSYS-Chat-1M features in-the-wild conversations with state-of-the-art LLMs.\\n\\n7 FUTURE WORK\\nAs we move forward, our commitment to fostering transparency and accessibility in the realm of LLM remains unwavering. To stay up-to-date with the rapidly evolving nature of the LLM field, we are considering releasing quarterly dumps of the dataset. However, such an endeavor demands considerable computing resources, maintenance efforts, and user traffic, all while carefully handling potential data privacy issues. Therefore, we are actively seeking sponsors and collaborators to assist in this process and encourage the whole community to contribute models, conversations, and votes. Our efforts aim to emulate the critical data collection processes observed in proprietary companies but in an open-source manner. By doing so, we aspire to pave the way for more transparent research.\\n\\n8 CONCLUSION\\nIn this study, we introduce LMSYS-Chat-1M, a dataset containing one million LLM conversations. This extensive dataset provides insights into user interactions with LLMs, proving beneficial for tasks such as content moderation, instruction fine-tuning, and benchmarking. It serves as a valuable resource for enhancing our understanding and refinement of LLM technologies.\"}"}
