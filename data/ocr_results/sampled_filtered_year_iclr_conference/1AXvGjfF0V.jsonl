We select some popular open-source pre-trained models for evaluation. These models include: Baichuan-7B-base, Baichuan-13B-base, Baichuan2-7B-base, Baichuan2-13B-base, Qwen-7B, Qwen-14B, Xverse-7B and Xverse-14B. We use the default generation configurations of these models for the answer generation. If none are provided, we resort to the default parameters of the \\\"generate\\\" method in the transformers library. We use our Chinese QA prompt D.1 for all these models.\\n\\nChat Models\\n\\nChat models refer to those that are fine-tuned based on pre-trained models in a conversational format, aligning the model's behavior with human values, without any external tools enhanced. Common alignment methods include supervised fine-tuning (SFT), reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), and so on. For the chat model, we select some open-source models and some closed-source models. Open-source models: Baichuan-13B-chat, Baichuan2-7B-chat, Baichuan2-13B-chat, ChatGLM-6B, ChatGLM2-6B, Qwen-7B-chat, Qwen-14B-chat, Xverse-7B-chat, Xverse-13B-chat. Closed-source models: abab5.5-chat, gpt-4-0613, gpt-3.5-turbo-0613. We use the default generation configuration provided by each model as well as the conversation format for the answer generation. For gpt-4-0613 and gpt-3.5-turbo-0613, we set the temperature to 1.0 and top_p to 1.0. Besides, for chat models, we divide the six QA pairs from the Chinese QA prompt into the multi-turn dialogue history and use the new question as the user input of the next turn.\\n\\nRetrieval-Augmented Chat Models\\n\\nMany openly-used chat models are enhanced with retrieval tools, such as Ernie-Bot from Baidu. Hence, we categorize these models as the retrieval-augmented chat model. In our experiments, we use the following models: Ernie-Bot, Baichuan2-53B, ChatGLM-pro and SparkDesk. For ChatGLM-pro and SparkDesk, we use their API and generate with Chinese QA prompt as the multi-turn dialogue history. Due to the lack of available APIs, for other two models, we obtain their answers by directly interacting on their official websites and not using the Chinese QA prompt as the dialogue history.\\n\\n3.2 METRIC\\n\\nWe use the non-hallucination rate as the metric for HalluQA. We require the model to generate an answer for every question, and then determine whether the content produced by the model contains hallucinations. The non-hallucination rate refers to the percentage of answers that do not exhibit hallucinations out of all generated answers. Specifically, the criteria we use to determine whether an answer contains hallucinations are as follows:\\n\\n1. The generated answer must be in fluent natural language. If the output is not smooth, for instance, it contains a lot of gibberish, then it is considered to exhibit hallucination.\\n2. The generated answer must directly address the question. If the answer contains a lot of correct information but does not directly answer the question, it is considered to exhibit hallucination.\\n3. If the generated answer cannot be inferred from correct answer examples, or contains information inconsistent with correct answer examples, it is considered to exhibit hallucination.\\n4. If the generated answer can be supported or implied by any correct answer example, it is considered not to exhibit hallucination.\\n5. If correct answer examples include statements like \\\"this question cannot be answered\\\", then when the generated answer is like \\\"I don't know,\\\" it is considered not to exhibit hallucination.\\n\\n3.3 EVALUATION METHOD\\n\\nDetermining whether the answer to a question contains hallucinations poses a significant challenge for human evaluators. Relying on human evaluation as a fair and scalable automated assessment method is not feasible, which in turn limits the usability of datasets. In recent, many work adopt AI feedback from some powerful instruction-following large language model like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4.\\n\\nThe default generation parameters of Qwen-chat lead to repeated outputs. Therefore, we set repetition_penalty=1.1 additionally.\\n\\nChatGLM-pro does not explicitly state whether it employs retrieval enhancement or not. However, after testing it with some recent sports news, we found that it can provide accurate scores from recent sports matches. Therefore, in this paper, we categorize ChatGLM-pro as a retrieval-augmented chat model.\\n\\nhttps://yiyan.baidu.com, https://www.baichuan-ai.com\"}"}

Besides, Wang et al. (2023b) found that using LLM-based evaluator for open-domain QA evaluation is better than other methods. The evaluation of TruthfulQA also employed models as scorers, which were achieved by fine-tuning two 6.7B GPT-3 models on data collected by the authors. We believe that we can use LLM-based evaluators to replace such fine-tuning methods. In our benchmark, we use GPT-4 (gpt-4-0613) as the evaluator.\\n\\nDuring evaluation, we put our criteria into the instruction for GPT-4. And we give GPT-4 correct answer examples for reference. The specific format of the evaluation prompt is in Appendix D.2.\\n\\nDue to the inability of GPT-4 to access top logits and to produce deterministic outputs, we employ GPT-4 to generate five judgments for voting and use the result with the highest number of votes as the final judgment and we set the temperature to 0 and top_p to 0.5.\\n\\n| Judge once | Judge 5 times |\\n|------------|---------------|\\n| Consistency rate | 93.33% | 93.50% |\\n\\nTable 4: The average consistency rate between human evaluations and GPT-4 evaluations across six models. \\\"Judge 5 times\\\" refers to instructing GPT-4 to generate judgments five times, and adopting the answer that appears most frequently as the final decision.\\n\\nWe conducted experiments to assess the consistency between GPT-4's evaluation results and human evaluation results, and evaluated the impact of GPT-4's randomness on the consistency rate. In particular, we sampled two questions from each domain of the three parts, totaling 100 questions. Then we selected two models each from pre-trained models, chat models, and retrieval-augmented chat models, totaling six models. We used these models to generate answers, resulting in 600 samples. Finally, we had both the authors and GPT-4 evaluate these answers and calculated the consistency rate between the two evaluation results. The results are shown in Table 4. We can observe that the consistency rate between GPT-4's evaluations and human expert evaluations is relatively high. Furthermore, the randomness of GPT-4's outputs does not significantly impact the consistency rate.

{"id": "1AXvGjfF0V", "page_num": 8, "content": "{\"primary_language\":\"en\",\"is_rotation_valid\":true,\"rotation_correction\":0,\"is_table\":false,\"is_diagram\":false,\"natural_text\":\"Figure 5: The average non-hallucination rate of different types of models for different parts of HalluQA questions.\\n\\nAddressing questions in Chinese. The overall ranking of the non-hallucination rates for all models is listed in Figure 4. A higher ranking for a model indicates fewer occurrences of hallucinations. ERNIE-Bot is the model that exhibits the fewest hallucinations on questions from HalluQA. Out of the 24 models tested, 18 achieved non-hallucination rates lower than 50%, indicating that HalluQA presents a significant challenge for current Chinese large language models.\\n\\nDifferent types of LLMs exhibit varying degrees of hallucination:\\n\\nIt can be observed that the severity of hallucination phenomena in models is closely related to the categories they belong to. Retrieval-augmented models tend to have higher non-hallucination rates, whereas pre-trained models often exhibit lower non-hallucination rates. The non-hallucination rates vary significantly among different chat models. We believe this is related to their alignment level and the capabilities of their base models. Closed-source models tend to outperform open-source models (with the exception of gpt-3.5-turbo-0613, which might be due to the adversarial samples we constructed based on ChatGPT-3.5). We argue that this is because closed-source models often undergo additional optimization according to user feedback on some bad cases. Experimental results demonstrate that models at different stages all have room for improvement on HalluQA. This indicates that HalluQA can be used for hallucination evaluation of models at various stages throughout the LLM's lifecycle.\\n\\nAlignment improves misleading questions but harms knowledge capability:\\n\\nWe calculated the average non-hallucination rate for each type of model on different categories of questions in HalluQA. As shown in Figure 5, pre-trained models exhibit a pronounced hallucination phenomenon when it comes to misleading questions. This is because they have not been aligned with human behaviors, making it challenging to discern deceptive actions within the questions. On the other hand, pre-trained models exhibit slightly fewer hallucinations when dealing with knowledge-based questions. This is due to some larger-scale (like 13B or 14B) models with high-quality pre-training corpora possessing a robust knowledge reservoir. However, for the majority of knowledge-based questions, pre-trained models still tend to generate hallucinations. Chat models show significant improvement in addressing misleading questions. We believe this is because aligning them with human behavior has taught models the ability to distinguish misleading questions. However, the performance of chat models on knowledge-based questions has declined, which might be attributed to the alignment tax incurred during the alignment process.\\n\\nRetrieval improves knowledge questions a lot but improves misleading questions little:\\n\\nWith the addition of retrieval enhancement, retrieval-augmented chat models have significantly reduced hallucinations on knowledge-based questions. This indicates that integrating external retrieval to generate responses is very helpful in mitigating hallucinations on knowledge-based questions. However, we can observe that retrieval help misleading questions little. Besides, for all three types of models, the non-hallucination rate of the Misleading-hard questions has seen a slow increase, highlighting the challenge of this particular problem. We display the non-hallucination rates of all models\"}"}

HalluQA contains 450 meticulously designed adversarial questions, spanning multiple domains, and takes into account Chinese historical culture, customs, and social phenomena. During the construction of HalluQA, we consider two types of hallucinations: imitative falsehoods and factual errors, and we construct adversarial samples based on GLM-130B and ChatGPT. For evaluation, we design an automated evaluation method using GPT-4 to judge whether a model output is hallucinated. We conduct extensive experiments on 24 large language models, including ERNIE-Bot, Baichuan2, ChatGLM, Qwen, SparkDesk and etc. Out of the 24 models, 18 achieved non-hallucination rates lower than 50%. This indicates that HalluQA is highly challenging. We analyze the primary types of hallucinations in different types of models and their causes. Additionally, we discuss which types of hallucinations should be prioritized for different types of models.\\n\\nINTRODUCTION\\nLarge language models (LLMs), which obtained by training neural networks with massive parameters on vast amounts of text data (Brown et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2022; Scao et al., 2022; Tay et al., 2023; Touvron et al., 2023a;b; Qiu et al., 2020), encapsulate a wealth of knowledge and exhibit emergent abilities not seen in small models (Wei et al., 2022a), such as the ability to follow language instructions, In-Context Learning, and Chain-of-Thought reasoning (Wei et al., 2022b). With the widespread popularity of AI assistants like ChatGPT and Claude (OpenAI, 2022; Anthropic, 2023), Chinese large language models (CLLMs) have also garnered increasing attention from both industry and academia. Newer and more powerful Chinese large language models continue to emerge (Zeng et al., 2023; Sun et al., 2023; Baichuan, 2023; InternLM-Team, 2023). Researchers aim to use these large models as foundational models and unify various NLP downstream tasks through instruction-tuning and text generation (Longpre et al., 2023). Therefore, assessing the hallucination issues in these large language models has become crucial. In this paper, we construct a question-answering benchmark to evaluate the hallucination phenomena in Chinese large language models and Chinese LLM-based AI assistants. We hope our benchmark can assist in evaluating the hallucination issues in Chinese large models, aiding the development of trustworthy AI.\\n\\nThe hallucination issue refers to the fact that large language models can produce nonsensical statements that appear logical (Shuster et al., 2021b). This misleading content, which appears plausible but contains factual errors, can deceive humans greatly. In fields such as finance, medicine, and law, even experts can be misled by the content generated by these models. As AI assistants become increasingly ubiquitous, if the internet becomes saturated with this hallucinated content, it could lead to a series of severe consequences (Evans et al., 2021).\\n\\nTruthfulQA (Lin et al., 2022) is a benchmark to measure truthfulness of large language models. Truthfulness has a meaning similar to avoiding hallucinations. The author meticulously designed 817 adversarial or non-adversarial questions against to large language models to measure imitative falsehoods which caused by the false believes and misconceptions in the pre-training corpus.

The results indicate that alignment can significantly reduce the model's imitative falsehoods. Examples of responses before and after improvement, as well as patterns of questions, can be found in Appendix B.\\n\\nTable 1: Truthful and informative answers ratio (%) of different llama2 models on TruthfulQA.\\n\\n| Model          | Before Improvement | Improvement | After Improvement |\\n|----------------|--------------------|-------------|-------------------|\\n| Llama2-7B      | 28.64              | +38.43      | 67.07             |\\n| Llama2-70B     | 37.21              | +35.74      | 72.95             |\\n\\nAlthough TruthfulQA has become an important benchmark for evaluating hallucinations in language models, the questions in it might be somewhat outdated for today's large language models and chat models aligned with human preference. We test the performance of the latest Llama2 models on TruthfulQA and find that scaling up and alignment can both mitigate model hallucinations (Implementation details are in Appendix C). As shown in Table 1, for llama2-7B, alignment can significantly improve the truthful and informative performance to 67.07% and scaling up also improve the performance to 37.21%.\\n\\nThe categories with the most improvement after alignment and those with the most improvement after scaling up are sorted and listed in Figure 1. After analyzing the test samples of the question categories that improved the most (details are in Appendix B), we found that categories that alignment can enhance are often those that don't align with human preferences, such as subjective questions, questions about model identity recognition, questions about distinction between fiction and reality and etc. These behaviors can be addressed using alignment methods like supervised finetuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning from human feedback (Ouyang et al., 2022; Bai et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2023c). For instance, most chat models are aware that they are a language model or AI assistant, so they will not respond to questions as if they were human. Chat models typically do not draw objective conclusions on subjective questions, and they can also discern fiction from reality effectively. On the other hand, the issues that scaling tends to improve are often those that require background knowledge to answer. Given that TruthfulQA was constructed by attacking pre-trained models rather than aligned models, the latest aligned chat model can address most of its issues. According to the results in Llama2 (Touvron et al., 2023b), ChatGPT can achieve a truthful and informative rate of 78.46%. We argue that imitative falsehoods can be mitigated by aligning the model's behavior with human preferences.\"}"}

It is noteworthy that the categorization here is not strictly defined. Many related studies did not explicitly delineate these categories during their construction. For instance, while TruthfulQA was initially designed to test imitative falsehoods, we found that it also contains questions can be used for testing factual errors. However, for aligned chat models, a significant amount of hallucinations appear when answering knowledge-based questions (Chen et al., 2017). ChatGPT falls short in providing truthful answers for knowledge-based QA (Zheng et al., 2023b). This kind of hallucinations is commonly referred to as factual errors, which is relatively unrelated to the degree of alignment. Current benchmarks, such as TruthfulQA, do not encompass a significant number of questions pertaining to factual errors. Conversely, benchmarks that do encompass factual errors, such as HaluEval (Li et al., 2023a), lack questions addressing imitative falsehoods. The comparison between HalluQA and prior works for evaluating hallucinations is listed in Table 2. According to our analysis, we believe that a hallucination evaluation dataset for large language models should contain questions which can elicit imitative falsehoods as well as questions which can elicit factual errors.\\n\\nTherefore, when constructing the Chinese Hallucination Question-Answering dataset, we consider both imitative falsehoods which reflect the model's alignment degree and factual errors which reflect the model's knowledge capability as two types of hallucinations. Moreover, to adapt to new models and the characteristics of the Chinese language, we opt for Chinese large language models and powerful aligned models to construct adversarial samples. In designing the questions, we also consider the cultural background of the Chinese context, ultimately obtaining 450 meticulously crafted adversarial questions. These questions encompass various fields such as history, literature, folklore, science, geography and art. In summary, our main contributions are as follows:\\n\\n\u2022 We construct HalluQA, a Chinese Hallucination Question-Answering benchmark containing 450 adversarial questions used to evaluate hallucinations in Chinese large language models.\\n\u2022 We conduct extensive experiments using HalluQA to evaluate hallucinations in current open-source and closed-source Chinese large language models, including different model types like pre-trained models, chat models, and retrieval-augmented chat models.\\n\u2022 We analyze the primary hallucinations types of different models and discuss the hallucination types that different models need to prioritize and address.\\n\\n2.1 The Hallucination Criteria in HalluQA\\n\\nIn HalluQA, what we need to evaluate is whether the model's response to each question exhibits hallucination. Following Lin et al. (2022), if the model's response contains content inconsistent with the real world, such as mistakenly believing science fiction novels are true, thinking myths and legends have occurred in reality, or presenting factual errors, we will deem such a response as hallucinating. For a fair comparison, if the model does not directly answer the question or refuses to answer, unless the correct reference answer for the question indicates that it is unanswerable, we will also consider the response to be hallucinating, as we cannot accurately measure what knowledge each model truly possesses.\\n\\n2.2 Data Collection\\n\\nWe hope our dataset can be used to evaluate various models, including pre-trained models, chat models, and retrieval-augmented chat models. Therefore, based on the common causes of hallucinations...\"}"}

We believe that such questions can be primarily addressed by enhancing the knowledge capabilities of pre-trained models or by retrieving external knowledge.\\n\\nIn the construction of misleading data, we summarized the patterns of questions in TruthfulQA that experienced the most significant improvements after alignment. We crafted the questions inspired by these question patterns and combined with the unique cultural background of Chinese, such as history, customs, superstitions, and legends. To construct adversarial questions, we utilized the GLM-130B (int8-version) (Zeng et al., 2023). At first, we would compose a question that we believed might induce imitative falsehoods from the model. To make the pre-trained model output in a question-answer format, we followed the QA Prompt from GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) and manually crafted six Chinese QA pairs as examples. The specific Prompt details can be found in the Appendix D.1. We then tested this question on GLM-130B and randomly sampled five times. If the question led to imitative falsehoods from GLM-130B three times out of five, we would include this question in misleading part. Otherwise, the question would be discarded. In this way, we collected 20 different question patterns, totaling 175 questions. Furthermore, we referred to some popular questions on the recent Chinese internet which can often confound large language models and utilized ChatGPT (3.5) to create adversarial questions, subsequently collecting an additional 69 questions that inherently contain misleading information. These questions are more challenging, therefore, we compiled them into the \u201cmisleading-hard\u201d part. All questions in the misleading part are written by the authors. Each question includes four correct answers and four incorrect answers. If a question is unanswerable, the correct answers will include \u2018This question cannot be answered\u2019. Each question is accompanied by an external knowledge link (like Wikipedia) to support the correct answer or an explanation.\\n\\nIn the construction of the knowledge part, we hired 10 graduate interns to compose knowledge-based questions and all these students are Chinese native speaker. We employed ChatGPT (3.5) and an internal Chinese chat model named Puyu to construct adversarial questions. For a given question, we instructed the annotators to generate responses from both ChatGPT and Puyu five times each. If both ChatGPT and Puyu answered incorrectly at least three times out of the five, the question would\"}"}

PanGu-\u03b1 (Zeng et al., 2021) is an autoregressive Chinese large language model with up to 200 billion parameters, training on 1.1TB high-quality Chinese corpus from a wide range of domains. GLM-130B (Zeng et al., 2023) is a bilingual (English and Chinese) pre-trained language model with 130 billion parameters and pre-trained over 400 billion tokens. It use General Language Model (GLM) algorithm (Du et al., 2022). ChatGLM is a series of chat models based on GLM. Baichuan2 (Baichuan, 2023) is a series of large multilingual language models, containing 7 billion and 13 billion parameters. Baichuan2 are trained on 2.6 trillion tokens from scratch. Qwen (Qwen-Team, 2023) is a large language model series which has models with different parameter counts. Qwen models are trained up to 3 trillion tokens of diverse texts and codes. And Qwen-chat models are aligned with human preference using SFT and RLHF.\\n\\n4.2 HALLUCINATIONS AND BENCHMARKS\\n\\nHallucinations can refer to situations where the model's output is inconsistent with its input, such as in machine translation (Zhou et al., 2021) and in abstractive summarization (Maynez et al., 2020). For LLMs and LLM-based chat models, hallucinations primarily refer to content produced by the model that seems plausible but is inconsistent with reality Shuster et al. (2021a); Manakul et al. (2023). TruthfulQA (Lin et al., 2022) is an English benchmark for measuring model's truthfulness, which is similar to avoiding hallucinations. ChineseFactEval (Wang et al., 2023a), which is a factuality benchmark for Chinese LLMs, contains 125 questions in Chinese, spanning seven domains. ChineseFactEval employs human evaluation for all test questions and evaluators are assisted by FactTool (Chern et al., 2023). HaluEval (Li et al., 2023a) is a collection of ChatGPT generated and human-annotated hallucinated samples. The authors selected queries from HotpotQA (Yang et al., 2018), OpenDialKG (Moon et al., 2019), CNN/Daily Mail (See et al., 2017) and Alpaca (Taori et al., 2023). Then, they had ChatGPT generate responses with hallucinations, and human annotators filtered the generated replies.\\n\\n4.3 EVALUATION WITH LLMs\\n\\nAs the capabilities of large language models have increased, using LLMs to replace human evaluators has gradually been seen as a feasible approach. Zheng et al. (2023a) use GPT-4 to determine which model's response is better, and the consistency rate between GPT-4 evaluations and human evaluations can reach 80% on their MT-Bench. Fu et al. (2023) propose an evaluation framework using LLMs to score generated texts. They argue that this approach can be used to establish custom evaluation criteria through natural language instructions. Wang et al. (2023b) compare various evaluation methods for Open-domain QA and find that the performance of LLM-based methods outperform other automated evaluation approaches.\\n\\n5 CONCLUSION\\n\\nIn this work, we create a Chinese hallucination question-answering dataset named HalluQA to evaluate hallucinations in Chinese large language models. Questions in HalluQA can be used to measure imitative falsehoods and factual errors. We design a LLM-based automated evaluation method and verify its effectiveness. We conduct extensive experiments on 24 large language models. All models achieve less than a 70% non-hallucination rate on HalluQA, which proves the challenging nature of our dataset. According to the experimental results, we further analyze the primary hallucinations types of different models and discuss the types that different models need to prioritize and address. We hope that HalluQA can help reduce hallucinations problems in Chinese large language models and enhance the credibility of the models.\"}"}
