Recent question answering (QA) benchmarks that attempt to assess reasoning are often limited by a narrow scope of covered situations and subject matters. We introduce WIKIWHY, a QA dataset built around a novel auxiliary task: explaining why an answer is true in natural language. WIKIWHY contains over 9,000 \\\"why\\\" question-answer-rationale triples, grounded on Wikipedia facts across a diverse set of topics. Each rationale is a set of supporting statements connecting the question to the answer. WIKIWHY serves as a benchmark for the reasoning capabilities of LLMs because it demands rigorous explicit rationales for each answer to demonstrate the acquisition of implicit commonsense knowledge, which is unlikely to be easily memorized. GPT-3 baselines achieve only 38.7% human-evaluated correctness in the end-to-end answer & explain condition, leaving significant room for future improvements.\\n\\nINTRODUCTION\\n\\nError analyses of practical NLP systems in recent history demonstrate that some of the mistakes made by state-of-the-art models would be avoided by basic human intuition (Shuster et al., 2022), and some of the most challenging tasks for models are the same ones that might be trivial to human children. With modern systems' impressive performance on tasks such as grammar correction showing that manipulating language is not the issue, LLMs seem to face a fundamental lack of common sense\u2013 an understanding of everyday phenomena and how they interact with each other and the world at large. As striking gains in subjective performance on summarization, creative text generation, and apparent language understanding continue to be called into question, the development of strong benchmarks to assess reasoning capabilities for these LLMs grows more important.\\n\\nOne popular approach to measuring reasoning capability is through performance on question answering (QA) benchmark tasks where direct queries for information act as a straightforward examination of a system's \\\"understanding.\\\" Classic QA datasets, however, are primarily concerned with retrieving factoids to answer questions of \\\"Who\\\", \\\"What\\\", \\\"When\\\", and \\\"Where\\\". These questions have been shown to be answerable (with high accuracy) by simple pattern-matching approaches (Wadhwa et al., 2018), thereby limiting their ability to measure the aforementioned reasoning capability. Looking to maintain the breadth of topics covered while increasing the difficulty of the QA task, researchers introduced multi-hop QA datasets like HotpotQA (Yang et al., 2018). While challenging, the task's extra complexity mostly leads to unnatural questions that can be addressed with iterated factoid retrieval and entity resolution, rather than a necessary understanding of how different entities interact. Noticeably absent in these prior datasets are \\\"why\\\" questions, which prompt for not factoids, but explanations\u2013 reasoning made explicit.\"}"}

Input = $Q$, Output = $A$.\\n\\nFor thoroughness, we confirm high performance on Task 1 (Standard QA) in the open-book setting. For this set of experiments, we use the classic approach of breaking the task into separate retrieval and reading comprehension phases. We experiment with BM25 (Robertson et al., 2009) and Dense Passage Retriever (DPR) (Karpukhin et al., 2020) as our document retriever, using their Pyserini implementations (Lin et al., 2021). Using the Natural Questions (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019) encoder, as in the original DPR paper, we build custom indices around segments from the subset of Wikipedia Articles shown to workers at collection time. For reading comprehension, we experimented with RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019) and Big Bird (Zaheer et al., 2020) QA models. We also fine-tune a Fusion-in-Decoder (FiD) (Izacard & Grave, 2020) model (80-10-10 split; default configurations), hypothesizing the decode-time combination of ideas could better model cause-effect relations.\\n\\nThe performance was unsurprisingly high, with BM25 achieving a high Top-1 Accuracy score of 0.810 in retrieval and FiD reaching a mean BERT-f1 of 0.78 (Table 7 in Appendix). While retrieving the appropriate Wikipedia passage relating to some topic is straightforward, we found that producing an explanation of comparable quality to our gold rationales was difficult for the models we tested.\\n\\nTask 2: Explanation Only (EO). Input = $(C, E)$, Output = $X$.\\n\\nFirst, we examine task 2: generating an explanation given an initial cause-effect pair. Given their stronger zero-shot generalization (Wang et al., 2022), we choose decoder-only models for our baselines. In this vein, we investigate the few-shot abilities of GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) with OpenAI's most capable model, DaVinci-002, at otherwise default settings. To better coax out the intermediates between cause and effect, we conduct prompt engineering over Wei et al. (2022)'s Chain of Thought method. Our exemplars are shown in Figure 6.\\n\\nWe also make use of WIKIWIKIHY's scale for fine-tuning GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019). In this set of experiments, we attempt to balance improving GPT-2's understanding of the task's structure while preserving the model's \\\"intuitions\\\" for examination. We train GPT-2 for ten epochs using the training split ($\\\\approx 80\\\\%$ of the data) and Adam (Kingma & Ba, 2014) optimizer with standard hyperparameters (learning rate: $\\\\gamma = 0.001$, $\\\\beta_1 = 0.9$, $\\\\beta_2 = 0.999$, $\\\\epsilon = 1 \\\\times 10^{-8}$, decay: $\\\\lambda = 0$). For this tuned model we introduce special delimiter tokens $<$cause$>$, $<$effect$>$, and $<$explanation$>$ in addition to the beginning and end tokens $<$bos$>$ and $<$eos$>$. To support the delimiters and help the model distinguish the segments, we add token type embeddings (marking cause, effect, and explanation) as part of the preprocessing phase. At decoding time, we experiment with multiple temperatures.\\n\\nTask 3: Answer and Explanation (A&E). Input = $Q$, Output = $(A, X)$.\\n\\nTo investigate the performance of jointly predicting an answer and explanation given only a \\\"why\\\" question, we carry forward with our best performing baseline from the EO task, chain-of-thought prompted GPT-3.\\n\\nThe first setting in this experiment set tasks a single model with the full end-to-end procedure. Once again, we utilize Chain-of-Thought prompting, albeit with a modified prompt that also requests an answer to handle the different input format. Considering the impressive performance of existing IR techniques on the QA task described above, we also study an additional setting incorporating the QA task. In the \\\"pipeline\\\" setting, the explainer model still lacks access to the ideal answer (the explanation's starting point) but benefits from a reader model's access to the original context. Here we combine our strongest performing approaches to the QA and EO tasks to make a 3-step pipeline of retrieval (BM25), reading (FiD), and explanation (GPT-3).\\n\\n5.2 AUTOMATIC EVALUATION METRICS\\n\\nWhile the still developing area of text generation has measures and proxies for similarity that help with simple sequences, comparing reasoning sequences or rationale sets requires more involved\"}"}

The final alignment's length is used to compute F-score metrics.\\n\\nMeasures. With the two topologies introduced in \u00a73.3 in mind, we propose two related metrics, unordered and ordered, to handle sets and sequences, respectively.\\n\\nUnordered Evaluation. This first approach compares the ideas contained in the predictions and references. First, we split predicted and reference explanations into \\\"ideas\\\" or \\\"steps\\\" by sentence. We then compute a matrix of pairwise similarity scores before using a threshold to classify \\\"matches\\\". Since a single prediction sentence may contain multiple reference ideas, we keep separate counts of precise prediction steps and covered reference steps. These counts are then micro-averaged for the test set's overall precision, recall, and F1 scores.\\n\\nOrdered Evaluation. To respect the structure of multi-hop explanations, we penalize incorrectly ordered explanations. Here, we use the previously generated pairwise score matrix and its alignments to generate all possible assignments of prediction sequence elements to reference elements. As demonstrated in Figure 3, we compute the length of the longest common subsequence (LCS) between a prediction alignment against the reference labels for each candidate assignment. This length becomes the count of correctly incorporated structural elements\u2013 true positives. Note that the LCS alignment discounts repeated ideas in the prediction.\\n\\nMetric Validity. To understand the usefulness of our constructed metrics, we compare them against human judgements. A panel of 3 undergraduate students compared pairs of predictions and references on two binary scales: (1) Similarity \\\"Is the prediction similar to the reference?\\\" and (2) Correctness \\\"Is the prediction a valid or correct explanation of the cause-effect pair?\\\" Summing the panelist scores for each pair, we found a strong correlation \\\\( r = 0.82 \\\\) between the similarity and correctness judgement. This validates comparison with WIKI gold explanations as a useful proxy for explanation quality. Our proposed sentence-level processing incorporates the intuitions of checking for completeness with recall and penalizing over-explanation with precision.\\n\\nFurther, we use a single-explanation version of F-score to compare this proposed automatic metric with human judgement (the proposed F-score measures aggregate through the whole dataset). With this variation, we find a modest correlation \\\\( r = 0.35 \\\\) between ordered F1 and similarity, among other weaker correlations.\\n\\nBesides supporting our proposed methods, this correlation analysis also enabled a data-driven approach to calibrating our similarity metric and match criteria. For each similarity metric, we selected a starting point through manual inspection of prediction-reference-similarity triples (which threshold value divides \\\"genuine\\\" from mistaken similarity) and used correlation for refinement. After trials with BLEURT (Sellam et al., 2020) and BERTScore (Zhang et al., 2020), different underlying models and different match thresholds, we selected BERTScore using a large DeBERTa (He et al., 2021) model (microsoft/deberta-xlarge-mnli) at a threshold of 0.64.\\n\\n5.3 HUMAN EVALUATION\\n\\nRecent studies by Goyal et al. (2022) show that automatic metrics may not reliably evaluate results produced by models with few-shot capabilities like GPT-3. In light of this, we supplement our automatic metrics with human evaluations.\"}"}

Following this evaluation, we select the highest scoring explanations for each set of experiments for additional fine-grained evaluation.

Mark Win if you prefer the generated explanation, Tie if you have no preference, and Lose if you prefer the reference explanation.\\n\\n5.4 RESULTS\\n\\nFine-Grained Human Evaluation. With our human evaluation experiments, we find significant room for improvement across the board. Our strongest baseline, GPT-3 with greedy decoding, produced explanations judged to be satisfactory only 66% of the time in the most favourable setting of Task 2: EO (Table 3). Moreover, these explanations were judged to be worse than the gold reference 58% of the time. These results from our strongest baseline leave plenty of room to improve upon and motivate future work on this reasoning task.\\n\\nDecoding. Our experiments show increased performance with lower temperature sampling and best results with greedy decoding (Table 2). This aligns with existing notions of higher temperatures better suiting \u201ccreative,\u201d open-ended tasks as opposed to more grounded ones. Explaining, as we hypothesize, relies more on the embedded assumptions in a generative model rather than the tenuous associations made more likely at higher temperatures.\\n\\nModel Differences. We find that GPT-3 significantly outperforms GPT-2. Comparing GPT-3\u2019s output against its predecessor\u2019s strongest setting shows increases in both ordered and unordered F1 scores by over 50%. Despite benefiting from fine-tuning and additional structural support from token type embeddings, GPT-2\u2019s explanations are lacking compared to GPT-3\u2019s few-shot explanations using only 4 exemplars. We find that GPT-2\u2019s statements are often not only incomplete/unsatisfying for explaining the cause-effect relation at hand but also simply invalid. 94% of GPT-2\u2019s statements were deemed worse than WIKIWHY\u2019s gold references. The only area GPT-2 outperformed GPT-3 was in concision, however this is more a demerit of GPT-3 rather than a merit of GPT-2. We found that GPT-3 tended to occasionally add unnecessary detail to its explanations, often needlessly defining one of the entities in the prompt.\\n\\nAnswer & Explanation. On the A&E task, we find results that align cleanly with preconceived intuitions. Our baseline model is able to better handle explanations from points A to B when A is fixed and provided. Requiring the same procedures to generate more output creates more variance as incorrect or alternative starting points mislead the remaining generation. The \u201cpipeline\u201d setting strengthens this trend, as the better-informed answer generation allows for a higher quality explanation. This setting, simulating a three-step process with different models handling each step, demonstrates an intermediate performance between having the oracle-provided answer and requiring the explainer to manage the entire process. The \u201cvalidity\u201d criteria of our human evaluation is especially interesting under this setting, where the model\u2019s input excludes the correct answer (the cause). While the majority of the end-to-end setting\u2019s explanations were marked incorrect or unsatisfying, a notable proportion was still marked as having a valid chain of reasoning. This supports the chain-of-thought premise that short, logical strides are more manageable for LLMs, but the approach is still insufficient for generating satisfactory explanations of target phenomena.\\n\\nExplanation Failure. A typical error observed in GPT-3\u2019s predictions is repeating the cause-effect relation. To explain why \\\\[A\\\\] leads to \\\\[B\\\\], GPT-3 might only write \\\\[B\\\\] because \\\\[A\\\\] or another...\"}"}

Our key contributions are thus:\\n\\n- We propose explanation within cause-effect relations as a novel problem formulation for exploring LLM reasoning ability.\\n- We create WIKIWIKI, the first question-answering dataset focusing on reasoning within causal relations, spanning 11 topics.\\n- We perform experiments on state-of-the-art, generative models to investigate various settings and establish baseline results with sizable room for improvement.\\n- We introduce idea-level evaluation metrics for free-form text (explanation) generation and a human judgment correlation analysis, demonstrating that (1) reference similarity is strongly correlated with explanation correctness, and (2) the metrics we introduced correlate with this proxy.\\n\\n**RELATED WORK**\\n\\nCause and Effect. Causality has been a subject of rigorous work in various fields. In science philosophy, Pearl (2009) has contributed seminal work relating to causal models, Bayesian networks, and causal strength via interventions and counterfactuals. These ideas have even been incorporated into QA tasks through Knowledge Graph approaches, such as filtering spurious latent correlations (Sui et al., 2022). While our work emphasizes cause-and-effect, we are unconcerned with causal strength. Starting with Wikipedia-grounded relations ensures valid relations. Instead, we are interested in the information encoded into LLMs rather than augmented structures such as knowledge graphs.\\n\\nMulti-hop Question Answering. While datasets such as HotpotQA (Yang et al., 2018) and HybridQA (Chen et al., 2020) are instrumental in gauging models' ability to handle multiple sources and modalities, they are focused on iterated factoid retrieval. Although chaining multiple facts into...\"}"}

Vision and language tasks have also intersected with both QA and reasoning. The Visual Question Answering (VQA) dataset (Agrawal et al., 2015) prompts textual answers to questions about images. However, the caption-based generation leads to surface-level questions that require little reasoning ability, and the multiple-choice output format precludes explicit reasoning. The vision-based Sherlock dataset (Hessel et al., 2022) is much closer to our work, focusing on abductive reasoning (working backward from a consequence). Setting aside modality differences, WIKIHY requires deeper reasoning with its multi-hop explanations.\\n\\nExplainable QA. One previous approach to building explanation resources collects direct answers to \u201cwhy\u201d questions. TellMeWhy (Lal et al., 2021) features question-answer pairs tied to short story narrative contexts. The dataset skips step-wise explanations, prioritizing reading comprehension instead. On the other hand, ELI5 (Fan et al., 2019) dives deep into reasoning with long-form, detailed explanations. However, the open-endedness (compared to explaining a specific cause-effect relation) complicates evaluating candidate responses.\\n\\nAnother line of QA work emphasizes a rationale component as support for answer predictions. Datasets like CoS-E (Rajani et al., 2019), eQASC (Jhamtani & Clark, 2020), and EntailmentBank (Dalvi et al., 2021) focus on explanation and reasoning much like WIKIHY, albeit with significant differences (Table 1). CoS-E's explanations for CommonsenseQA (Talmor et al., 2019) mark an important first step, but the commonsense explanations have limited depth, often requiring a single hop of reasoning. eQASC and EntailmentBank feature richer explanations with more complex structure, tightly focusing on grade school level science facts. Regarding structure, fixed-length rationale in CoS-E, eQASC, FEVER (Thorne et al., 2018), and e-SNLI (Camburu et al., 2018) capture less granularity, while entailment trees accept limitations in scale and naturalness in exchange for complete ordering information. Previous datasets tend towards retrieval tasks with eQASC's corpus of all rationale sentences and EntailmentBank's collection of root causes. Retrieval enables simple evaluation, at the cost of decreased difficulty, the possibility for exploiting spurious artifacts, and reduced debugging opportunity.\\n\\n3 B ACKGROUND\\n\\n3.1 W HY FOCUS ON \u201cWHY\u201d QUESTIONS\\n\\n\u201cWhy\u201d questions are underrepresented in other QA datasets. Users tend to ask straightforward questions that use words like \u201cwho\u201d, \u201cwhat\u201d, \u201cwhen\u201d or \u201cwhere.\u201d Questions of this more common form have simple answers that state standalone facts which may be elaborated but do not require explanation. Consider the pair,\\n\\n\u201cQ: What is the fifth most abundant metal in the Earth\u2019s crust? A: Calcium.\u201d\\n\\nThe answer is straightforward.\\n\\nIn contrast, a \u201cwhy\u201d QA-pair encodes a cause-effect relation. Take, for example,\\n\\n\u201cQ: Why can\u2019t I eat calcium metal? A: Calcium reacts exothermically with water and acids. This pair encodes the causal relation \u201ccalcium has an exothermic reaction with water, therefore eating calcium is not advised.\u201d\\n\\n(Figure 2). The answer to a \u201cwhy\u201d-question is an explanation itself (the reaction being exothermic explains the toxicity), but we can take it a step further and ask \u201cwhy\u201d again to request the understanding, or intuition, of this process.

This extra step is especially worth taking since it allows WIKIWHY to not only test if a model \\\"knows\\\" that \\\"an exothermic water reaction makes calcium toxic\\\" but also if it \\\"understands\\\" the underlying mechanics of why that is the case.\\n\\n3.2 FORMULATION\\n\\nFormally defined in \u00a75, we propose a generative explanation task. Previous works have made strides in assessing reasoning through multiple choice (Lu et al., 2022), retrieval (Asai et al., 2019), and partial generation (Dalvi et al., 2021). While these works are undoubtedly crucial towards the end goal of understanding and reasoning, their task formulations have some drawbacks. Referring back to education, studies on human students have shown that multiple choice questions \\\"obscure nuance in student thinking\\\" (Hubbard et al., 2017). Likewise, a selection decision can be correct for retriever systems but for the wrong reasons. Augmenting multi-hop factoid questions with an additional task of selecting the relevant supporting facts from the context passage, Inoue et al. (2020) emphasizes that interpretability is lost in the absence of explanation. Furthermore, text generation to combine existing ideas is arguably a different task than generating from scratch. The field of psychology defines recall (mental retrieval of information) as a distinct process from recognition (mental familiarity with the cue) (Mohr et al., 1989). Neural nets' biological inspiration suggests that there might be a similar difference between cue-aided retrieval and freeform generation. In the context of NLP, we are interested in the implicit understandings and assumptions embedded in LLMs and hypothesize that an entirely generative approach is most conducive to this study.\\n\\n3.3 EXPLANATION STRUCTURE\\n\\nExplanations come in various structures, as seen in the typology defined by Ribeiro et al. (2022). Shown in Figure 2, our work focuses on a subset of said typology. WIKIWHY includes two structures that explain cause-and-effect relations: (1) multi-hop step sequences and (2) rationale sets. While the chain structure adds intermediate conclusions between cause and effect, rationale sets contain elements that support the relation from without. The rationale set topology acts as our general, catch-all case that other structures can be condensed to. Since our data collection procedure promotes a stepwise, ordered approach, we also consider the sequential topology to respect the structure exhibited in applicable explanations. We forego the unstructured approach as even limited structure helps bring freeform generated text evaluation within reach. Finally, we opt against pursuing the most complex entailment tree organization to maintain naturalness and facilitate crowdsourcing scalability.\"}"}

We developed an extensive data collection and validation pipeline around Amazon Mechanical Turk, depicted in Figure 5 (appendix). For each stage involving crowdsourced annotations, we perform rigorous worker-level quality control to ensure the dataset's quality. The exact procedures are detailed in subsection A.2 in the appendix.\\n\\nPreprocessing. We begin with English Wikipedia's corpus of \\\"Good Articles,\\\" whose strict criteria of verifiability and neutrality (among others) ensure that WIKIWHY does not evaluate models on misinformation or opinionated views. From these articles, we extract passages containing causal relations using causal connectives. We selected a list of causal keywords (Appendix, \u00a7subsection A.1) from a more extensive set of causal connectives as their presence in a passage guarantees the existence of a cause and effect relation\u2014some excluded connectives such as \\\"since\\\" or \\\"as\\\" are highly prevalent but are not necessarily causal. The presence of a causal word pattern on its own is a very simple heuristic\u2014in the subsequent collection steps, we hired crowdworkers to ensure the quality of each sample.\\n\\nQA Synthesis (Stage 1). Randomly sampled preprocessed Wikipedia passages containing potential causal statements were shown to qualified Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) workers (see ethics statement for details), who were tasked with extracting the highlighted causal relation from the passage and re-framing it as a \\\"why\\\" question when possible. While automatic cause-effect relation extraction has seen recent progress (Yang et al., 2022), this human intelligence task (HIT) remains vital for two reasons. First, we find that quality in cause-effect is crucial for meaningful and valid explanations in the following stage. More importantly, we depend on human annotators to add sufficient context to the text of the cause, effect, and question to disambiguate them. This enables the question and cause-effect relation to be presented to models without the context we prepared (e.g., \\\"Why was the river diverted?\\\" is unanswerable without additional context). This feature is key to enabling WIKIWHY to assess the information and ideas within LLMs as opposed to whatever may be present in the context.\\n\\nExplanation Synthesis (Stage 2). After verifying the quality of the examples, we prompt crowdworkers to explain cause-effect pairs from stage 1. To encourage structured explanation, we supply an interface that allows sentences or ideas to be entered one at a time in separate fields. Though the input pairs should be context-independent, we provide the original passage as an aid for understanding the topic. Furthermore, we provide the link to the source article to encourage explanations leveraging topic-specific information in addition to commonsense knowledge.\\n\\n4.2 DATASET DESCRIPTION\\n\\nEntry Contents. In addition to the main fields of the question, answer, and explanation, each dataset entry contains the underlying relation's cause and effect, the passage the question was extracted from, the article the passage is from, and Wikipedia's topic categorization for that article.\\n\\nTopic Diversity. WIKIWHY improves upon other datasets due to its ability to examine reasoning proficiency across a broader range of concepts (Table 9 in Appendix contains examples from the six most frequent topics).\\n\\nRationale. The statistics for the reasoning component are shown in Appendix Table 11. On average, each rationale contains 1.5137 elements. Figure 4 (Appendix) shows a histogram of rationale length by sentence count. WIKIWHY includes a range of rationale lengths, with more than one-third of examples (36%) containing two or more reasoning steps.\"}"}

For Stage 1, workers are prohibited from submitting more than 20 entries until their annotations have been manually validated. The annotation result passes through another phase of manual validation to ensure that the quality is kept up after workers' initial submissions are accepted by quality control. For Stage 2, we track a separate list of qualified workers for explanation quality. Similar to Stage 1, Stage 2's initial submit limit (the \u201cspeed bump\u201d) is 10. Undergraduate students manually reviewed the examples from stage-2-qualified workers. These panelists were instructed and shown demonstrations of marking explanations as satisfying or not and correcting minor errors for slight quality improvements. While manually approved workers write each Wiki explanation, these hand-reviewed samples ultimately comprise the test and development sets. The continuous flow between stages is enabled by a backend system we implemented to maintain a database of submissions. This system serves inputs to both MTurk interfaces, as well as the front-end validation interfaces provided to the undergraduate panelists.\\n\\nWe include additional evaluations of our generated explanations using simple metrics.

Rainey was fired by the University of Texas in 1944.\\n\\nExplanation: If the University of Texas is conservative, they wouldn\u2019t want people working there who have liberal views.\\n\\nCause: the large size and reddish tint of red maple buds\\n\\nEffect: Red maple buds which form in fall and winter are often visible from a distance.\\n\\nExplanation: The color red stands out from a distance, so if the buds are red in the fall and winter, you\u2019d be able to see them from a distance.\\n\\nCause: There were advances in technology, lower energy prices, a favorable exchange rate of the United States dollar, and lower alumina prices.\\n\\nEffect: Productions costs of aluminum changed in the late 20th century.\\n\\nExplanation: With advances in technology, prices of manufacturing change usually because they are now easier and cheaper to make. In this case it is aluminum that the price changed on because the technology improved the process.\\n\\nFigure 5: Dataset Collection and Validation Pipeline\\n\\nFigure 6: GPT-3 Few-shot Exemplars\"}"}
