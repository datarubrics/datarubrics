However, evaluating LLM reasoning is challenging because system capabilities continue to grow while benchmark datasets for tasks like logical deduction have remained static. We introduce MuSR, a dataset for evaluating language models on multistep soft reasoning tasks specified in a natural language narrative. This dataset has two crucial features. First, it is created through a novel neurosymbolic synthetic-to-natural generation algorithm, enabling the construction of complex reasoning instances that challenge GPT-4 (e.g., murder mysteries roughly 1000 words in length) and which can be scaled further as more capable LLMs are released. Second, our dataset instances are free text narratives corresponding to real-world domains of reasoning; this makes it simultaneously much more challenging than other synthetically-crafted benchmarks while remaining realistic and tractable for human annotators to solve with high accuracy. We evaluate a range of LLMs and prompting techniques on this dataset and characterize the gaps that remain for techniques like chain-of-thought to perform robust reasoning.\\n\\n1 INTRODUCTION\\nA great remaining challenge for large language models (LLMs) is the ability to do reasoning and planning (Valmeekam et al., 2023; Tang et al., 2023; Dziri et al., 2023). Numerous methods have been proposed to augment models' capabilities on this front, including prompting strategies like chain-of-thought (Wei et al., 2022), integration with tools (Schick et al., 2023; Lyu et al., 2023; Ye et al., 2023), and embedding models in search loops (Bostrom et al., 2022; Creswell et al., 2023).\\n\\nDo these approaches suitably address the shortcomings of LLMs? This is difficult to measure. Math reasoning tasks can be approached in a two-stage fashion (Gao et al., 2022; Ye et al., 2023): the LLM translates the problem into a formal specification which is then solved with conventional tools. Other datasets like RuleTakers (Clark et al., 2020) and CLUTRR (Sinha et al., 2019) are solvable with rule-based systems (Kazemi et al., 2023a; Ye et al., 2023; Poesia et al., 2023). Finally, datasets like SocialIQA (Sap et al., 2019) or StrategyQA (Geva et al., 2021) that involve more nuanced commonsense are often structurally simple (i.e., only involve 1-2 steps of reasoning). What is lacking is a benchmark involving both sophisticated natural language and sophisticated reasoning.\\n\\nIn this work, we present MuSR: Multistep Soft Reasoning, a dataset focused on tasks involving reasoning based on text narratives. The narratives in our dataset are hundreds of words long and present evidence in ways that require commonsense knowledge to unpack. Then, when all of the evidence is assessed, coming to a final answer requires \u201cSystem 2\u201d-style deliberation, which takes a different form for each domain of interest. The domains we address here, murder mysteries, object placement, and team assignment, involve commonsense reasoning about physical (Bisk et al., 2020) and social situations (Sap et al., 2019), theory-of-mind, and more. Crucially, these types of reasoning arise naturally from text descriptions of each problem.\\n\\n1 Project website can be found at https://github.com/Zayne-Sprague/MuSR\"}"}

We then populate the set $F$ with the three facts proving a means, motive, and opportunity. For the innocent suspect, we randomly chose two of the facts used to prove guilt, then add these and one additional \\\"suspicious fact\\\" to the set $F$, creating a set that does not establish guilt. A suspicious fact has no impact on $\\\\Phi(F, q^i)$ and should not add any additional information relevant to the murder; for example, \\\"x is affiliated with a gang, and this is suspicious\\\".\\n\\nIn total, $F$ is composed of three facts per suspect that are passed to the reasoning tree creation stage. The reasoning tree will expand upon the descriptions for these facts, $G$, such as the fact that someone could have had an opportunity to murder a victim in their study by having a key to the study, which can be recursively expanded to describe why they had a key to the study. More details about the construction can be found in Appendix G.2.\\n\\n4.2 OBJECT PLACEMENTS: OBSERVATIONAL AND THEORY OF REASONING\\n\\nInspired by theory-of-mind datasets (Le et al., 2019; Gandhi et al., 2023) we chose a domain that focuses on a group of people moving items around to different locations. Other people in the story either see each item move or not for various reasons. The reader is then asked where a person would look for an item if asked to search for it, where the last move they saw is the most likely place they'd begin to search. Because of this, Object Placements requires spatial and physical reasoning as well as reasoning about people's awareness in $S(T)$ and $C(T)$. The reader is tested further by having to determine the observations of a specific person, modeling their belief state of where an item is. Notably, our dataset features longer narratives and more sophisticated scenarios than past theory-of-mind datasets.\\n\\nIn this domain, $q^i$ asks where a person believes an item to be in the story. The answer, $a^i$, is then the last location the person saw the item move in the story, or where the item was originally if they never saw the item move.\\n\\n$\\\\Phi(F, q^i)$ is backed by a set of sequential moves $F$, where each move is a collection of observations denoting whether each person in the story saw the move or not. A move is denoted as a fact \\\"$P$ moves $I$ to $L$\\\" where $P$ is a person, $I$ is an item, and $L$ is a location, respectively. For every move, each person other than the one moving the item is given a chance $c$ (set to 0.33 for our experiments) to see the move, which will add either \\\"$P'$ saw $I$ move to $L$.\\\" or \\\"$P'$ did not see $I$ move to $L$.\\\" to $F$.\\n\\nThe reasoning trees then focus on explaining why someone may or may not have observed a move. This integrates commonsense reasoning: for example, a barista was busy doing latte art for a customer and didn't observe the manager moving an item from the fridge to the storage room. More details can be found in Appendix G.3.\\n\\n4.3 TEAM ALLOCATION: SOCIAL AND CONSTRAINT REASONING\\n\\nTeam Allocation takes inspiration from assignment and MAX-SAT problems (Pan et al., 2023). In this domain, the reader must determine the most optimal assignment of people to tasks where each person can be assigned to one task. Because there are three people and two tasks, two people must work together, adding a social dynamic to the assignment. $S(T)$ and $C(T)$ often involve inferring about past experiences and personal preferences of an individual as to why they do or do not perform a skill well. They also include reasoning over the strength of a relationship between two people in a workplace setting, which requires social reasoning.\\n\\n$F$ represents these relations through numeric scores corresponding to each person's skill for a task and numerical teamwork score. Specifically, three people are each assigned score values for task capabilities (0, 1, or 2) and for their pairwise relationships. To solve a Team Allocation question, $\\\\Phi(F, q^i)$ can enumerate the assignments adding the skill level and teamwork scores as a score for the overall assignment and then take the assignment that maximizes this score, $a^i = \\\\Phi(F, q^i) = \\\\max_{a^i \\\\in A} \\\\text{skill}(a^i) + \\\\text{teamwork}(a^i)$. We found that using a small number of values for skills translated well into soft natural language statements where the decision of human annotators respects the hard underlying reasoning process. We further enforce that the optimal assignment outperforms all other assignments by a score of at least 2.\\n\\nThe reasoning tree then describes factors that contribute to these skills and relationships. More details can be found in Appendix G.4.\"}"}

See Appendix C for a discussion of using models other than GPT-4. Table 2 describes the statistics of our generated datasets. We provide examples from each dataset in Appendix F.\\n\\n| Size # | # Steps | # CS | Rule-based |\\n|--------|---------|------|------------|\\n| Murder Mystery | 250 | 10 | 9 | 50.0 |\\n| Object Placements | 256 | 11 | 6 | 35.9 |\\n| Team Allocations | 250 | 10 | 9 | - |\\n\\nWe do not aim to formally evaluate fluency or coherence of our generated stories. GPT-4 generates stories that are, based on our inspection, very strong according to these attributes. We also do not evaluate intrinsic \\\"sensibility\\\" of commonsense, which we also found to be very high; we opt instead to evaluate this in an end-to-end fashion based on whether humans can correctly reason about the right answer.\\n\\nRule-based Performance\\n\\nTable 2 also shows the performance of two rule-based systems we developed to sanity-check our datasets. The Murder Mystery rule baseline looks for which suspect has the longest chapter in the context. Object Placements looks for the location that is mentioned the most. We find that each of these is near random chance (reported in Table 5).\\n\\nHuman performance\\n\\nTo validate that the answers derived from actually match what can be derived from our narratives, we conducted a human evaluation of dataset quality. A total of 7 annotators were used, 4 of whom were authors of the paper and 3 of whom were hired undergraduate students not familiar with the datasets. Annotators were given the exact \\\"chain-of-thought+\\\" prompt that we evaluated the LLMs with, described in the next section.\\n\\nTable 3: A granular view of the human annotation scores for each domain including the lowest score, highest score, average score, and the majority vote score. No model or prompt variant scores higher than any of our annotators.\\n\\n| Domain          | Lowest | Highest | Average | Majority |\\n|-----------------|--------|---------|---------|----------|\\n| Murder Mystery  | 88.2   | 94.1    | 92.1    | 94.1     |\\n| Object Placements | 85.0  | 95.0    | 90.0    | 95.0     |\\n| Team Allocations | 91.1  | 100.0   | 95.1    | 100.0    |\\n\\nWe triply-annotated between 34 instances for Murder Mystery and Team Allocation and 40 instances for Object Placements. Table 3 displays the annotators' scores broken down by the lowest, highest, and average scores for each annotator; the average is based on all (instance, annotator) pairs, over 100 for each domain. Our best annotator across all domains was one of the undergraduate students not familiar with the dataset construction procedure. We also display the majority annotation. Crucially, the majority is higher than the average annotator, showing that many annotator errors are simply due to inattentiveness and our panel of three annotators is able to collectively arrive at the right answer via voting. Overall, we believe this majority is reflective of the ceiling for human performance on these datasets, demonstrating that it is very high.\\n\\nAblating our creation process\\n\\nFinally, we aim to establish that the procedure we have presented so far in this paper is in fact necessary to produce high-quality data. Table 4 shows a set of ablations on our construction procedure on 25 examples per domain, measured with several metrics. First, we track the length (\\\\( \\\\text{Len} \\\\)) and diversity (\\\\( \\\\text{Div} \\\\)) of the context, measured by self-BLEU of a sentence from one narrative compared with all other narratives. We also compute Fact Recall (R), which is a percentage of the number of facts entailed in the context from the gold reasoning trees leaf nodes, using GPT-4 to check for entailment of each fact. Finally, we evaluate GPT-4's performance. Although our goal is to make a challenging dataset, in the context of this table, low GPT-4 performance usually means that the examples are ambiguous or unsolvable.\\n\\nBasic prompting for any domain yields extremely short stories (often ten sentences in length). They are also usually very similar. The GPT-4 performance is quite low; anecdotally, we found these stories to have spurious solutions. Using diversity sampling to improve the reasoning gives a better.\"}"}

Llama2 and Vicuna-based language models are able to get above chance for each domain but only slightly. Although these models are often compared to GPT variants, they are unable to surpass GPT-3.5 on two out of the three domains, with Team Allocation being the only one where the Vicuna models outperform slightly. GPT-4 performs the best out of all the models we tested, but still underperforms compared to humans. Although GPT-4 was instrumental in creating this dataset, it does not have the reasoning capabilities to solve it end-to-end. A small qualitative analysis of some of the error classes exhibited by the GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4 are discussed in Appendix D.\\n\\nResults on Prompt Variants\\n\\nTable 7 shows GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, the two models that did best on MuSR, evaluated with different prompting strategies. Overall, the best performance is seen when the model is given a single-shot example with the \u201c1-shot CoT+\u201d or \u201cFew-shot CoT+\u201d prompt variants. However, adding more examples is not always better. Despite significant jumps in performance on some domains, the models still underperform compared to the human majority.\"}"}

Besides basic chain-of-thought, we are not aware of a single approach that naturally handles all the reasoning types in our dataset and scales to examples of the difficulty we present. As a result, we present three different methods in Table 6 each tailored to one domain and evaluated in that domain. We describe these approaches here and in Appendix E.\\n\\nIn the Murder Mystery domain, we implement a variation of Decomposed Prompting (Khot et al., 2023) by manually imposing the breakdown of motive, means, and opportunity and prompt GPT-4 to decide on each suspect for each fact. We then decide the murderer based on who has the most facts proving guilt, with random selection in case of ties. Despite aligning well with the reasoning strategy, the accuracy is lower than prompting GPT-4 end-to-end.\\n\\nNext we used SymbolicTOM (Sclar et al., 2023) on the Object Placements domain with minor adjustments. Specifically, we use GPT-3.5 to produce the resulting state of a sentence that is then used in the graph creation algorithm. The low accuracy of SymbolicTOM is mostly attributed to selecting key entities from sentences that are not as templated as the original dataset (Le et al., 2019). Because the contexts are more natural, entities' actions and observations can span multiple paragraphs rather than be isolated in one sentence. This introduces a new level of complexity for these neurosymbolic methods, and past approaches on ToM cannot generalize here.\\n\\nFinally, we run a variant of Program-Aided Language Models (Gao et al., 2022) on the Team Allocation domain. From the story, PAL must deduce numerical values for the skill and teamwork levels of each person and pair. Once this is done, we give it a description of the reasoning strategy for Team Allocation, which it implements in a program and solves returning the assignment with the highest score. We find that this solution pairs quite well with the domain, outperforming the end-to-end models on both zero and single-shot settings, but falling short of aggregate human performance.\\n\\n**Conclusion**\\n\\nIn this paper, we introduced Multistep Soft Reasoning (MuSR) a reasoning dataset written with natural narratives presenting complex reasoning scenarios involving various reasoning strategies. We presented a neurosymbolic dataset generation method for constructing instances of our dataset, which can be scaled in complexity as more powerful models emerge. Human evaluation and other intrinsic validations shows that the construction method is sound for sufficiently large models. Our results show that LLMs are currently unable to match human performance on specific types of reasoning like multi-step and commonsense in our three domains. This dataset presents a challenge for both the largest and smaller language models: we believe it can serve as (1) a benchmark for LLMs; (2) a benchmark for general neurosymbolic approaches over language; (3) a general construction procedure for generating challenging datasets as models improve.\"}"}

GPT-4 often failed to create complex enough facts that could be broken down recursively to a larger depth. We believe that prompting and better LLMs may increase the depth of acceptable deductions and is an important area of future work for our method.\\n\\nWe experimented with validation on Amazon Mechanical Turk, but found that many workers performed very badly in qualification rounds. When we collected justifications to try to improve the quality of their judgments, we found many justifications which we suspected were written by ChatGPT.\\n\\nIn this section, we elaborate on the features employed to evaluate the datasets as illustrated in Table 1.\\n\\nThis denotes datasets containing organically constructed text, not created by templates. For instance, bAbI generates text by filling in predefined templates. True Detective is human-authored. Datasets like EntailmentBank and ENWN, while incorporating natural text, present them in specialized \u201cpremises\u201d rather than contexts, hence the notation \u223c. SocialIQA uses ATOMIC to create templates for the questions, and while it aims to test commonsense reasoning in social situations, the questions and answers might not always reflect natural English. MuSR produces natural contexts with language prompted from an LLM without any templating.\\n\\nRefers to datasets that require commonsense knowledge to answer questions. EntailmentBank and RuleTakers supply all the necessary facts to answer a question in the input, requiring no commonsense. BigTOM is harder to classify as nearly all the facts required to answer the question are given, but understanding what it means for someone to have a \u201cbelief\u201d could require non-trivial commonsense from the reader. MuSR intentionally omits certain commonsense facts during its construction, compelling users to draw on their inherent knowledge for problem-solving.\\n\\nDenotes datasets requiring a layered reasoning approach to deduce answers. Each reasoning layer involves merging multiple premises to generate interim conclusions, which then contribute to the final inference. SocialIQA is not designed to require such intermediate conclusions. In contrast, MuSR, through its design, compels users to recreate the reasoning tree used in the questions creation (or something similar to it) for comprehensive understanding.\\n\\nThis captures datasets with underlying structure (chains of facts, etc.) that can potentially assist in deducing answers. True Detective was written by humans and thus lacks an intermediate structure. MuSR has the reasoning trees used to create each example given for every question.\\n\\nThis category represents datasets resilient to systematic, rule-based solutions without the need for a language model. Datasets like Babi and ToMi, given their textual templates, may reveal patterns that can be reverse-engineered to facilitate solutions. Contrarily, datasets such as MuSR, True Detective, and SocialIQA lack easily identifiable patterns, safeguarding them against oversimplified, template-based resolutions.\"}"}

The results of the CoT+ and 1-Shot CoT+ systems running on these are shown in Table 8. The overall performance of LLMs on them is similar to our main MuSR dataset.\\n\\nDespite being able to use the same workflow as GPT-4 and producing some examples of high quality, many still include major flaws in the reasoning tree that do not stand up to our inspection. For example, some exhibit common reasoning errors seen in smaller language models like hallucination.

We use the model as implemented by the authors with two changes. First, the resulting states that are used in creating the graph are not precomputed and are instead queried on-the-fly using GPT-3.5. Second, if the model abstains from answering, we randomly sample one of the answer choices. The data format originally intended for SymbolicTOM was the format for ToMI (Le et al., 2019); however, our data is easily translated into the format for SymbolicTOM through simple manipulation.\\n\\nWe test program-aided language models (Gao et al., 2022) on the Team Allocation domain. Given a question, we first prompt LLMs to generate a Python program, and then execute the program using the Python interpreter to obtain the final answer. We test PAL in both zero-shot setting and one-shot settings.\\n\\nFor the zero-shot setting, we provide detailed instructions on how the program should be organized for solving a question. As shown in Listing 32, the prompt asks for a program containing three steps: (1) assign a value to the variables representing each person\u2019s skill level on one of the two tasks; (2) assign a value to the variables representing how well two people work together, and (3) compute the scores for each of the options by adding up the scores for each person\u2019s skill level and the teamwork score. For the one-shot setting, we provide one demonstration of the question-program pair in addition to the detailed instructions, which leads to better performance compared to the zero-shot setting.\\n\\nListing 3: Murder Mystery Example 1\\n\\nIn an adrenaline inducing bungee jumping site, Mack\u2019s thrill-seeking adventure came to a gruesome end by a nunchaku; now, it\u2019s up to Detective Winston to unravel the deadly secrets between Mackenzie and Ana.\\n\\nWinston took a gulp of his black coffee, staring at the notes sprawled across his desk. A murder case at a bungee jumping site was definitely out of the ordinary. Today\u2019s victim was a young man named Mack, loud mouthed and cocky by all accounts.\\n\\nMack was bungee jumping the day he was killed. Oddly enough, according to the records, no one else was documented at the bungee jumping site that day, making this case even more peculiar. The first stop for the day was to visit one of Mack\u2019s housemates, a woman named Ana. They were seen leaving in the same vehicle from their shared housing complex the morning of the murder, and it was time for Winston to dig deeper.\\n\\nAs he pulled into the shared housing driveway, a nondescript car came into sight. He learned from neighbours that it was frequently used by multiple residents, but Ana had a peculiar interest in it. She would insist on driving whenever with a group of friends, later meticulously cleaning the car after each use. An idiosyncrasy of hers maybe, but a part of the puzzle nonetheless.\\n\\nWinston knocked on the door, Ana opened it warily, twiddling a cleaning cloth and spray in her hands and greeted him with a nervous nod. Ana gets nervous and fidgets with the cleaner and cloth when questioned. Winston could sense palpable unease as he started asking her questions.\\n\\n\u201cAna, did you not join Mack and the others for bungee jumping today?\u201d Winston questioned, to which she responded, \u201cI signed up to jump. But I didn\u2019t end up going through with it.\u201d\\n\\n\u201cAny particular reason you didn\u2019t join the others, Ana?\u201d Winston proceeded.\\n\\nAna took a deep breath, \u201cWell sir, my faith doesn\u2019t really permit bungee jumping. Truth be told, I was persuaded strongly by Mack. I had even signed up out of peer pressure but couldn\u2019t push myself.\u201d\"}"}

Mack had reportedly also been vocal about ridiculing Ana's faith, even encouraging others to join him in doing so. It was a significant factor in their relationship.\\n\\n\\\"Ana, did you and Mack leave in the same car for the bungee jumping event this morning?\\\" Winston gently pushed further.\\n\\n\\\"Yes. Yes, we did. We always carpool. \\\" She responded while anxiously using the cleaner and cloth on her car's dashboard. Her eyes flickered nervously back to Winston, expecting the next question.\\n\\nWinston took a deep breath, standing up to leave, \\\"Alright Ana, that should cover everything for now. We'll be in touch.\\\"\\n\\nAna nervously nodded without looking up from her cleaning, wringing the cloth repeatedly as Winston walked away, left again with another piece to the enigmatic puzzle of Mack's murder.\\n\\nThe day was getting older and Winston was getting more tired, but the case was fresh, and he wasn't one to back down. He tugged on his coat as he approached the bashful teen waiting for him by the police station.\\n\\n\\\"Mackenzie, it is?\\\" he asked, extending his hand.\\n\\n\\\"Yeah, that's right. \\\" The slight lisp, overlaid with blanket anxiety, confirmed what the school reports suggested.\\n\\n\\\"You were at the site when Mack... erm... you know, \\\" Winston's voice was methodical, calm \u2212\u2212 almost robotic. The suspicion on Mackenzie was not unfounded \u2212 the security cameras showed him buying nunchaku a week before.\\n\\nMackenzie shifted on his feet, looking away before answering, \\\"Yeah, I was there.\\\"\\n\\nWinston pulled out a small notebook, \\\"What were you doing there, Mackenzie?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Bungee jumping, like Mack... Then I left. I didn't... I didn't do anything... \\\" Mackenzie replied.\\n\\nInternally, Winston sighed at the never-ending waterfall of teenage angst this case was turning into.\\n\\n\\\"Martial arts, huh?\\\" Winston segued, gesturing to a bruise on Mackenzie's knuckles. \\\"Nunchaku particularly, I see? Training does include the use of those, correct?\\\"\\n\\nThe change in Mackenzie's demeanor mirrored the bitterness in the last month's weather \u2212 dark eyes replaced with ice-cold ones. \\\"Yeah, \\\" he admitted, shrinking slightly.\\n\\nMackenzie always took pride in being the best at everything. So when Mack got everything he wanted \u2212 the promotion to team captain, the respect, the attention \u2212 it was a hard pill for Mackenzie to swallow. Winston remembered the team talk, Mackenzie was indeed the top candidate but it had gone to Mack instead. What clinched it was Mackenzie's remarks about Mack, echoing whispers of dispute and bickering, lost in the crowded lunchroom. There were also multiple witness reports of the two seen arguing at the bungee jumping site previously. Mackenzie had indeed said disparaging, almost emotional things about Mack \u2212 all stemming from a potent brew of jealousy, Winston inferred.\\n\\nShifting later through the detritus of Mackenzie's life, Winston discovered the nunchaku that matched the forensics report. They were tucked away, but the layer of dust suggested they weren't a favored possession anymore. It wasn't hidden, it was misplaced \u2212 discarded in the throes of developing maturity.\\n\\nAs the sun started to set, Winston could see witnesses, scattered across the park, repeatedly pointing to the bungee jumping scaffolding. It occurred to him, then, the narrative of the past days. Mackenzie, jealous and wronged, over and over, at the same sight. It was quite a sight.\\n\\nWinston, shuffling back to the station, was left with one thought \u2212 Looks like Mackenzie had quite an eventful week.\\n\\nWho is the most likely murderer?\"}"}

Then, using an LLM, we create a reasoning tree leading to those deductions from facts in a story combined with commonsense. Finally, we iteratively generate a narrative one chunk at a time using the facts generated in step 2, validating the generations for fact consistency and recall.\\n\\nThe congruence between the reasoning and the text itself allows us to generate these datasets automatically with the aid of LLMs, using supporting logic to elicit examples that the LLMs themselves cannot reliably solve. Our novel neurosymbolic dataset generation procedure is shown in Figure 1.\\n\\nRecovering the reasoning from the final narrative itself is a hard problem, solvable by humans but not by GPT-4 using any of a number of prompting strategies and neurosymbolic approaches we tried. Notably, these properties do not hold when creating narratives with more basic prompting strategies: asking GPT-4 to define and write a murder mystery in a single shot leads to unnatural, homogeneous stories that may include inconsistencies, as we show later.\\n\\nOur contributions are as follows:\\n\\n1. We introduce a new reasoning benchmark, MuSR, consisting of 756 total examples across three domains that challenge state-of-the-art models such as GPT-4, Llama 2, and Vicuna.\\n2. We propose an algorithm for generating natural language narratives grounded in reasoning trees.\\n3. We analyze the performance of LLMs on our dataset, focusing on variants of chain-of-thought prompting and existing neurosymbolic approaches for these problems.\\n\\n### Background and Motivation\\n\\nWe survey past dataset efforts in Table 1, using our analysis to establish the need for a new textual reasoning benchmark. First, a number of prior benchmarks do not have natural text. Others do not blend commonsense and multistep reasoning. Finally, we want a dataset that contains ground-truth intermediate structure and which is not solvable with rules.\\n\\nMany past datasets are simply too artificial, including bAbI (Weston et al., 2016), BigTOM (Gandhi et al., 2023), ToMi (Le et al., 2019), RuleTakers (Clark et al., 2020), ProntoQA (Saparov & He, 2023; Saparov et al., 2023), and CLUTRR (Sinha et al., 2019). These datasets are generally designed to test some aspect of language model reasoning, but they are only challenging for \\\"pure\\\" LLM approaches; many are solvable with rule-based methods. Furthermore, many of these do not involve any commonsense reasoning, a key feature of reasoning from text.\\n\\nEntailmentBank (Dalvi et al., 2021), Everyday Norms: Why Not (Sprague et al., 2022), and BoardgameQA (Kazemi et al., 2023b) present somewhat more challenging multistep settings, but consist of isolated collections of facts, not grounded in complex narratives. LLMs can solve the former two datasets quite easily even without consulting ground truth facts. As these datasets are\"}"}

Several past systems employ an LLM in a search loop that enumerates a list of facts, generating conclusions deductively or abductively until a goal is reached (Bostrom et al., 2022; Creswell et al., 2023; Kazemi et al., 2023a; Sprague et al., 2022; Hong et al., 2022). However, these systems do not handle natural contexts where facts can be distributed among sentences across a long narrative. Other systems involve tools or neurosymbolic algorithms to help solve reasoning problems (Sclar et al., 2023; Gao et al., 2022; Ye et al., 2023); however, these are often run on artificial datasets that can be easily translated into formal specifications, and have limited ability to handle soft reasoning types like commonsense.\\n\\nOne versatile technique is prompting, including various chain-of-thought strategies (Wei et al., 2022; Yao et al., 2023) and techniques to measure consistency (Wang et al., 2023; Jung et al., 2022). Using these approaches to solve reasoning problems end-to-end has shown to be challenging (Ye & Durrett, 2022; Zhang et al., 2023; Xue et al., 2023; Valmeekam et al., 2023). Our dataset is ideally suited to test the limits of these approaches: a system must extract facts from our stories, apply appropriate commonsense to interpret those facts, and finally use multistep reasoning to arrive at an answer.\\n\\nOne alternative to the approach we describe could be to use human authoring. Our murder mystery domain is represented in the recent True Detective (Del & Fishel, 2022) dataset, which collects human-authored murder mysteries from 5minutemystery.com. We argue that a synthetic benchmark is preferable for two reasons. First, it is scalable and can be renewed as more capable LLMs are produced. For example, if the mysteries on the aforementioned website are solved by future LLMs, it will be costly and challenging to collect a new dataset, whereas a synthetic benchmark can be refreshed with more complex reasoning and longer narratives. The disentangling of logical reasoning and text generation gives us a reusable lever for producing instances more complex than what systems themselves can solve. Second, because our dataset can be regenerated, issues with dataset leakage and exposure to test data become less of a concern. Finally, note that while our benchmark involves GPT-4 generated narratives, the scaffolding of the construction process and the hidden facts involved mean that the final generated outputs are not trivially solvable with GPT-4. As long as the underlying information is faithfully preserved in the narrative, we believe our data instances are valid test cases for any well-behaved reasoning system, which we verify by measuring human performance.\"}"}

To generate these problems, we have a construction method with three stages:\\n\\nTree Template Construction, responsible for the reasoning strategy and initial gold fact set \\\\( F \\\\);\\n\\nReasoning Tree Completion, which generates a tree \\\\( T \\\\) of intermediate reasoning steps expanding upon \\\\( F \\\\);\\n\\nStory Generation, which embeds the facts generated from the trees into a natural narrative \\\\( x \\\\). This process is described here and is represented in Figure 1.\\n\\nThe construction algorithm finally yields tuples \\\\((F, T, x, \\\\{q_1, \\\\ldots, q_n\\\\}, \\\\{a_1, \\\\ldots, a_n\\\\})\\\\). Formally, the reasoning task is to predict answers \\\\( a_i \\\\) given the narrative \\\\( x \\\\) and the question to answer \\\\( q_i \\\\). The gold fact set \\\\( F \\\\) and reasoning tree \\\\( T \\\\) are used as part of the generation process but are generally not provided to an LLM at test time. Throughout the process, we use Prompt to denote using a prompted LLM to sample an output conditioned on another variable.\\n\\n3.1 TREE TEMPLATE CONSTRUCTION\\n\\nEach of our domains starts with a high-level fact set \\\\( F \\\\), and a set of question-answer pairs \\\\((\\\\left((q_1, a_1), \\\\ldots, (q_n, a_n)\\\\right))\\\\). For example, in our murder mysteries, the only question is \\\"who is the murderer?\\\" and \\\\( F \\\\) contains ground-truth information about each suspect (John is the murderer, John has an opportunity). Information for each domain is in Section 4, with facts shown in Figure 2.\\n\\nMore formally, \\\\( F \\\\) is a structured object with the requirement that there exists some program \\\\( \\\\Phi \\\\) such that \\\\( \\\\Phi(F, q_i) = a_i \\\\) for all \\\\( i \\\\).\\n\\n\\\\( F \\\\) can also be represented in natural language through templated expansion. Our questions \\\\( q \\\\) and answers \\\\( a \\\\) are templated. At this stage, we also generate additional facts \\\\( G \\\\) to increase diversity and help expand the story later. This is done by sampling from curated lists or by sampling from LLMs (e.g., when a coherent set of objects needs to be generated for object placement). These facts differ from those in \\\\( F \\\\) in that they are not templated but instead actual facts that must be included in the narrative. The output of this stage is a tuple \\\\((F, G)\\\\) which contains the core facts used to answer the question and a set of diversity facts used to give each question unique storylines.\\n\\n4\"}"}

We include the facts from $G$ while prompting the language model so that the generated facts include diverse information and ultimately help create interesting stories in the later stages.\\n\\nThese trees are automatically produced from root facts $f_i$ via recursively sampling from an LLM, in our case GPT-4. This process is shown in Algorithm 1 in Appendix G.1. We repeat this process to a specified depth, ultimately producing a set of leaf facts that deductively yield the original fact $f_i$ but require multi-step reasoning to do so. These facts are divided into two types: scenario-specific facts, which must be included in the ultimate narrative, and commonsense facts, which will not be stated but should be facts that most people would agree are true. We denote these sets of scenario facts and commonsense facts by $S(T)$ and $C(T)$, respectively, as shown in Figure 2.\\n\\nOur generation process involves controlling the depth and shape of trees generated. We also want to ensure that there are no vacuous transitions in our trees (e.g., the fact $f_i$ being explicitly stated in a leaf node) or reasoning \u201cshortcuts.\u201d To ensure this, we use a collection of tree validators $V = (v_1, \\\\ldots, v_k)$, per domain. These are often simple keyword lookups that prevent the keywords from appearing in the deduction, for example, preventing \u201cmotive\u201d from appearing in a lower-level deduction in the murder mystery domain so that the reader is forced to deduce a motive. For more details on validators for each domain, see Appendix G.\\n\\nAt each step in the tree, for a node with text $s$ we sample $T_1, \\\\ldots, T_m \\\\sim \\\\text{PromptLM}(T_1, \\\\ldots, T_m|s)$. We then filter this output against the validators $V$. We retry this prompt up to three times, and if we are not able to draw a valid sample, prune the branch of the reasoning tree, making the current deduction a leaf node. We repeat this process until the tree is at the target depth. Figure 2 shows an example of the resulting trees.\\n\\nIn the last stage, we use the scenario-specific leaf facts $S(T)$ from the reasoning tree. Our goal is to generate a narrative by sampling $\\\\hat{x} \\\\sim \\\\text{Prompt}(x|S(T))$ from an LLM with an appropriate prompt. However, for a long and complex narrative, $S(T)$ is not always reflected accurately in $x$; some facts may be dropped as the model produces more of a summary of the situation, for example.\\n\\nTo address this, we instead divide $S(T)$ into chunks relating to a specific answer choice (e.g., the information related to a specific possible murderer). We can then use this subset to prompt GPT4 for a \u201cchapter\u201d with a smaller list of facts. Once every chapter has been created, we concatenate all the chapters together into one narrative. Some domains use additional prompts to \u201csmooth\u201d the final narrative when necessary. Because our narratives do not need to be produced by one LLM call, they can scale to be over 1000 words (in this dataset) and theoretically to be even longer. We refer this process as chaptering; the overall process is broadly inspired by Yang et al. (2022).\\n\\n4 MURDER DOMAINS\\n\\n4.1 MURDER MYSTERIES: SOCIAL AND PHYSICAL DEDUCTIVE REASONING\\n\\nMurder mysteries are a classic domain requiring a variety of reasoning types. They have been explored in the context of LLM reasoning before (Frermann et al., 2018; Del & Fishel, 2022); however, ours is the first work to approach the scale of human-written murder mysteries with synthetic challenge data. Murder mysteries elicit physical and social reasoning in the fact sets $S(T)$ and $C(T)$.\\n\\nSpecifically, unique and complex social scenarios arise naturally in murder mysteries that lead to motives for murder and can require understanding social norms. Solving a murder mystery also requires temporal reasoning about a person having an opportunity to commit the crime.\\n\\nIn this domain, $\\\\Phi(F, q_i)$ is defined as an algorithm that can find the suspect with three facts in $F$. Specifically, the murderer and answer $a_i$ is the suspect with the facts \u201c$x$ has a means\u201d, \u201c$x$ has a motive\u201d, and \u201c$x$ has an opportunity\u201d.

Otis, the victim, would most definitely be missed. His usual vibrant energy that filled the hockey rink was replaced by cold, solemn silence.\\n\\nSome contradictions needed to be resolved. The crime scene at the hockey rink was empty, both at the time of the murder and throughout the investigation. Winston's only lead was Andrew, who was an old military pal of Otis. Winston heard that Andrew had recently switched his career to become a solo hiking guide. Indeed, a remarkable part of his solo hikes was his ability to help hikers they came across on the way overcome environmental dangers\u2014a way of applying his skills acquired from his military service. It was an unusual practice in the industry but allowed due to his military expertise in bomb disposal\u2014an odd career choice for a man of such skills.\\n\\nWinston drove to the outskirts of the town, where Andrew lived in a remote cabin. Andrew's solo job didn't always welcome company, but that didn't seem to bother him. Rumor had it that he uses his military skills to help strangers on the trails overcome environmental dangers\u2014detonating falling rocks, perhaps?\\n\\nOnce in the cabin, Winston noticed several hiking supplies meticulously arranged. He inspected them and found, hidden strategically among the normal hiking necessities\u2014food, water, emergency kit\u2014were several small explosives. Chills ran down his spine as he remembered a recent break-in at a military base.\\n\\n\\\"I see you have explosives mixed with your hiking guide supplies, \\\" Winston said, trying to evoke a reaction.\\n\\nAndrew replied calmly, \\\"Those are just for emergencies.\\\"\\n\\nListening to Andrew, Winston remembered that Otis had been friendly with him. Otis was always open with Andrew about his daily habits, even shared his calendar with him. Andrew was the only person who knew Otis would be alone at the hockey rink that evening.\\n\\nOn his way out, Winston remembered Andrew's frank words, \\\"I don't like to hang out after work.\\\"\\n\\nIt seemed somewhat true, living far from town, working alone, and being prone to avoid after-work hangouts. Winston thought to himself: Andrew did like to be alone. It all seemed so strange, the grenade murder, the empty hockey rink, Andrew's distant demeanor. However, he couldn't draw any obvious conclusions just yet. He needed more.\\n\\nDetective Winston sat on the chilly bleachers of the local hockey rink, a place as familiar to him as it was to Ervin, the mild-mannered Rabbi who had never missed a game. The rink was still splattered with telltale signs of the merciless violence that had taken place there. Otis had been killed during a game, a seemingly jovial event turned nightmarish by the unexpected detonation of a grenade.\\n\\nTaking his eyes off the crime scene momentarily, he scanned his surroundings and spotted his next person of interest: Ervin, a massive hockey fan, and a staunch supporter of their local team. His presence at the game had been expected, as his dedicated attendance was part of the everyday routine. Some of the spectators had mentioned Ervin stepping out of the stadium briefly, interestingly around the same time Otis was killed.\\n\\nNot missing his beat, Winston approached Rabbi Ervin, who was still in deep shock at the loss of a fellow spectator and friend, \\\"Rabbi Ervin?\\\"\\n\\nThe Rabbi looked up to meet the detective's prying eyes, \\\"I am Ervin, indeed. And you are?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I am Detective Winston, investigating the recent unfortunate event.\\\"\\n\\nObserving Ervin's face closely, Winston began: \\\"The strangest thing happened a few days ago.

He saw, Detective, he saw me committing the crime which I've regretted every day since, \\\" Ervin confessed.\\n\\nWinston let the confession sink in before shifting the subject subtly. \\\"I heard you were in the military?\\\"\\n\\nErvin smiled, just barely, nodding with a touch of pride. \\\"Yes, I am a former military officer. Had a special training in demolitions you see, before I found my calling in religion.\\\"\\n\\nWinston returned his smile, \\\"I suppose it's a bit of a leap from demolitions to the pulpit.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Just a tad, \\\" Ervin's laughter is soft. \\\"But the old life stays with you in ways you wouldn't expect. I've got a collection of war memorabilia back home. host some of my friends over sometimes, they marvel at these artifacts. I even got grenades in there. Nothing active, of course. They tend to catch the eye.\\\"\\n\\nWinston excused himself, leaving Ervin to mourn at the crash of their sanctuary of play turned battleground.\\n\\nWho is the most likely murderer?\\n\\nPick one of the following choices: 1 \u2212 Ervin 2 \u2212 Andrew\\n\\nYou must pick one option. Before selecting a choice, explain your reasoning step by step. The murderer needs to have a means (access to weapon), motive (reason to kill the victim), and opportunity (access to crime scene) in order to have killed the victim. Innocent suspects may have two of these proven, but not all three. An innocent suspect may be suspicious for some other reason, but they will not have all of motive, means, and opportunity established.\\n\\nIf you believe that both suspects have motive, means, and opportunity, you should make an educated guess pick the one for whom these are best established. If you believe that neither suspect has all three established, then choose the suspect where these are most clearly established. Explain your reasoning step by step before you answer. Finally, the last thing you generate should be \\\"ANSWER: (your answer here, including the choice number)\\\"\\n\\nLooking at Detective Winston's investigation into the characters of Ervin and Andrew, we can examine the means, motive, and opportunity for each.\\n\\nFirst, Andrew, an ex\u2212military guy and Otis's old friend, has a motive. His recent change to a hiking guide involves using his expertise in bomb disposal which demonstrates the means. Interestingly, the explosives noticed with the hiking supplies could very well be utilized for a crime like this. Additionally, his opportunity is clear, as he knew Otis' schedule, including his solitude in the hockey rink.\\n\\nErvin, the Rabbi and hockey fan, also has a motive, as his secret funds\u2212moving activity was found out by Otis. Like Andrew, Ervin also has a military background and knowledge of demolitions, hinting at the means. His opportunity lies in the fact that he was present at the hockey rink during the game, where Otis was killed, and reportedly stepped out of the stadium briefly around the same timeframe.\\n\\nHowever, Ervin's collection of war memorabilia including grenades were described as \\\"nothing active. \\\" Unless this is a misdirection and he does possess live grenades, this could imply that his grenades wouldn't be functional for the act. Andrew, on the other hand, has been found with actual explosives that are implied to be active. We can also note that Andrew's solitary activity and lifestyle further suggest his ability to commit such a crime without leaving apparent witnesses.\\n\\nTherefore, while both candidates present motive, means, and opportunity, it seems that Andrew's capacity to commit this crime is better substantiated. He has a clear opportunity knowing Otis's schedule, an explicit motive with his recent career change contrasted with his military prowess, and useful means evidenced by the explosives found among his hiking supplies.\\n\\nANSWER: 2 \u2212 Andrew\"}"}

As the manager, the responsibility of allocating Olivia, Alex, and Mia to the positions of Animal Caretaker and Exhibit Cleaner presented an intriguing conundrum. Each individual, with their distinct personalities and skill sets, added a layer of complexity to this assignment puzzle.\\n\\nLet's begin with Alex, the tall lad with bright eyes, whose history with the mighty beast of the animal kingdom, lacked a certain comfort. The lad, known to express an almost innate unease around animals larger than him, fell short of the prerequisites for an Animal Caretaker. His comfort zone extended to the four-legged companions in our homes, a sentiment I withheld from the petting zoo section of our park. Yet, his association and collaboration with Mia had seen quite the successes in their high school club's fundraising initiatives. However, his relationship with the gentle Olivia was not as seamless. Alex often mentioned feeling ostracized due to Olivia's tendency to maintain her distance. This seemingly innocent avoidance stirred disquiet within our hushed ranks. And all this, stemming from a disagreement rooted in their previous shared workplaces. Unresolved perhaps, but a factor nonetheless.\\n\\nThen, there was Mia, the determined bright spark, whose affinity for cleanliness would often bemuse us. She would spend her spare time in her immaculate home cleaning and reorganizing, while her enthusiasm for a spotless Exhibit could not be underestimated. However, her overly thorough methods would invariably result in clashes with Olivia, who criticized her for crossing some form of unspoken boundary. Mia too had her phobias, the gravelly roars of the zoo's majestic lion had once left her shaken and worried. Loud noises had a similar effect leaving her in a state of nervous terror, much like that of the petite animals held within our barriers. Yet, she was all smiles and peasant conversation around Alex during lunch breaks, sharing a sense of humor that lightened the mood of our everyday grind.\\n\\nFinally, subdued Olivia, a soul strangled with allergies, and a deep-seated fear for wild animals. An incident with a chimp in her past wove tales of nightmarish betrayal, enough to send her away from the animal exhibits during her zoo visits. Potent elements of dust and pollen resulted in uncontrolled sneezing fits, a remainder from her days at the school as a custodian, responsible for the cleanliness and maintenance.\\n\\nThree souls; Animals to be cared for, Exhibits to be cleaned. Assigning them was always going to be an enigma for anyone navigating the zoological labyrinth. Love for animals, discomfort, alliances, conflicts; each factor extraordinarily crucial in shaping not just the overall productivity but also the personal growth of each of these individuals at the Redwood Zoo.\\n\\nGiven the story, how would you uniquely allocate each person to make sure both tasks are accomplished efficiently?\\n\\nPick one of the following choices:\\n\\n1. Animal Caretaker: Alex, Exhibit Cleaner: Mia and Olivia\\n2. Animal Caretaker: Olivia, Exhibit Cleaner: Alex and Mia\\n3. Animal Caretaker: Mia, Exhibit Cleaner: Alex and Olivia\\n\\nYou must pick one option. The story should allow you to determine how good each person is at a skill. Roughly, each person is either great, acceptable, or bad at a task. We want to find an optimal assignment of people to tasks that uses their skills as well as possible. In addition, one task will have to have two people assigned to it. The effectiveness of their teamwork (great team, acceptable team, or bad team) also impacts the overall quality of the assignment.\\n\\nWhen two people need to work on a task and one is bad at it, they don't necessarily benefit from the other person being good, unless they work well together.\\n\\nWith different strengths, weaknesses, and interpersonal dynamics at play, you should allocate your team to find the single assignment to ensure that the tasks overall are completed as effectively as possible.\"}"}

However, Alex has a good working relationship with Mia from their previous fundraising activities. However, his relationship with Olivia is strained.\\n\\nNext, we have Mia. She loves cleanliness and would likely be ideal for an Exhibit Cleaner role. Nonetheless, she doesn't get along well with Olivia and has a deep fear of large, loud animals. Her bond with Alex is strong, as they share humorous exchanges during their breaks.\\n\\nFinally, Olivia is mentioned. Her allergies and fear of wild animals make her a poor fit for the Animal Caretaker role. She also seems to clash with Mia over cleaning methods. While her relationship with Alex is not explicitly described as negative, Alex has stated that he feels left out by Olivia, suggesting a strained relationship.\\n\\nGiven these insights, let's look at the options:\\n\\nOption 1 \u2212 Wouldn't work well because Olivia and Mia do not have a good relationship, so them working together on cleaning could be problematic. Also, Alex is not comfortable around large animals, making him a poor fit for the Animal Caretaker role.\\n\\nOption 2 \u2212 May not work as efficiently because Olivia has problems with allergies, which could be triggered by cleaning dust and pollen. Her fear of wild animals also makes her a poor choice for the Animal Caretaker. Again, Alex and Mia have a good relationship, but both are not comfortable with large animals.\\n\\nOption 3 \u2212 appears to be the best choice here. Mia, with her love for cleanliness, would be excellent as an Exhibit Cleaner, while the strained relationship between Olivia and Mia might not be too much of an issue if they work on different exhibits. Alex could bring his excellent teamwork and communication with Mia to the Exhibit Cleaning team, helping to mitigate Olivia's involvement. Mia's fear of animals and Alex's discomfort around them won't be an issue as they would not have to interact closely with the animals in their roles as Exhibit Cleaners.\\n\\nSo, after considering everyone's skills, comfort levels, and interpersonal dynamics, the answer would be:\\n\\nANSWER: 3 \u2212 Animal Caretaker: Mia, Exhibit Cleaner: Alex and Olivia.\\n\\nListing 35: Object Placements Reasoning Error\\n\\nIn the heart of the bustling studio, Ricky, Emma, and Danny readied themselves for a day of creating magic.

An air of creativity and anticipation lingers in the room, everyone aware that this was the first instrumental step in the creation of their masterpiece. In sync with the palpable creative energy, Ricky was engrossed in perfecting the rhythm of his song, preparing himself for an intense day ahead. Not too far away, Emma was sincerely engrossed in her role of musically steering the session. She was focussed on Ricky's progress, her eyes constantly monitoring him and her mind alive with ideas to enhance the music.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Danny was diligently covering every corner of the studio. He was making his rounds, ensuring that the studio was prim and proper for Ricky's crucial session. As part of his tasks, he passed by Ricky several times, always careful not to interrupt the artist's flow.\\n\\nEmma, engrossed in her thoughts, deftly moves the earphones to the producer's desk. She is preparing to tweak the sound settings, pre-empting Ricky's need for perfect audio in his performance. Diverting from his rounds, Danny found himself in the midst of a stirring conversation with a visiting sound engineer. Knowledge flowed between them, illuminating the studio's atmosphere, the engineer's insight bringing a new perspective into Danny's role. Ricky, ensconced in his own world, was in deep discussion with the blank page before him. The daunting silence of the empty studio buzzed with his focus, as he honed his lyrics to perfection in a space separate from the producer's. The visitor, oblivious to the careful choreography of the studio session, stood blocking Danny's general overview of the studio space.\\n\\nDelicately lifting Ricky's notebook, Danny orchestrates its move to the producer's desk. At the desk, he glimpses a pair of earphones indirectly drawing his attention amidst his routine of tidying up. Emma, from the isolated interior of a sound-proofed booth, lent her ears diligently to already recorded tracks, pouring over them for any room for improvement. Being lost in the music was her way of paying homage to her craft \u2212 an unspoken ritual she followed each time she embarked on a music production journey. The entirety of her focus was consumed by the musical notes and rhythm filtering through the studio speakers.\\n\\nConcurrently, Ricky was absorbed in the act of playing his guitar. His fingers navigated deftly over the strings, lost in an intimate dance with the instrument. As he played, the melodic strums reverberated throughout the studio, filling it with an infectious pulse that hinted at the birth of yet another musical masterpiece. Despite the flurry of activity around him, Ricky was lost in a world of his own, operating on a singular vision of delivering his best performance.\\n\\nIn the meantime, Danny was continuing his cautious management of the studio, ensuring that everything fell into place for the optimum recording session. His watchful eyes were scanning every corner, taking stock of the minor details that could impact the session. However, the design of the studio didn't allow for an unrestricted view into all the corners. The sound booth, where Emma was engrossed in her work, was out of his visual range. The seclusion provided by the booth, although crucial for immersive work, also acted as a barrier for Danny's comprehensive vigilance.\\n\\nAs the day progressed, the studio was entwined in a concerted symphony of dedication and workmanship, the trio, each engrossed in their pursuit, working together to create the best version of Ricky's impending album. As the final note of the day rang through the studio, each person revelled in the satisfaction of another day done right, another step closer towards the realization of Ricky's artistic vision.\\n\\nWithin the dynamic dance of the day's events, the relationships of the trio sang a compelling tune. Each individual played their crucial part in the creation of the impending masterpiece \u2212 Ricky with his raw talent, Emma with her passion for perfection, and Danny with his meticulous eye for detail. And as the lights faded on another day of creation, they could sense the beginning of an important chapter in their artistry, a silence collecting the scattered notes of the day, signing off on another critical step in the journey of Ricky's upcoming album.\\n\\nBased on this story, we want to identify where someone believes that a certain object is at the end of the story.

He boasted a deep understanding and appreciation for a wide spectrum of poetry styles, which revealed itself when he shared comprehensive and incisive feedback with poets.

His monotone delivery and self-conscious fear of boring people made him shy away from recitations.\\n\\nLastly, there was Lily.

At home, she had a routine of reading and analyzing poems, propelling her understanding of poetry.

Not too far away, Emma was sincerely engrossed in her role of musically steering the session. She was focussed on Ricky's progress, her eyes constantly monitoring him and her mind alive with ideas to enhance the music. Meanwhile, Danny was diligently covering every corner of the studio. He was making his rounds, ensuring that the studio was prim and proper for Ricky's crucial session. As part of his tasks, he passed by Ricky several times, always careful not to interrupt the artist's flow.\\n\\nEmma, engrossed in her thoughts, deftly moves the earphones to the producer's desk. She is preparing to tweak the sound settings, pre-empting Ricky's need for perfect audio in his performance. Diverting from his rounds, Danny found himself in the midst of a stirring conversation with a visiting sound engineer. Knowledge flowed between them, illuminating the studio's atmosphere, the engineer's insight bringing a new perspective into Danny's role. Ricky, ensconced in his own world, was in deep discussion with the blank page before him.
