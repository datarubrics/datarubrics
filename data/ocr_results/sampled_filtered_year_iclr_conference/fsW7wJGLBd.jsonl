To help researchers study this problem, we present a dataset of over 563,000 prompt injection attacks and 118,000 prompt-based \u201cdefenses\u201d against prompt injection, all created by players of an online game called Tensor Trust. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first dataset that includes both human-generated attacks and defenses for instruction-following LLMs. The attacks in our dataset have easily interpretable structure, and shed light on the weaknesses of LLMs. We also use the dataset to create a benchmark for resistance to two types of prompt injection, which we refer to as prompt extraction and prompt hijacking. Our benchmark results show that many models are vulnerable to the attack strategies in the Tensor Trust dataset. Furthermore, we show that some attack strategies from the dataset generalize to deployed LLM-based applications, even though they have a very different set of constraints to the game. We release data and code at tensortrust.ai/paper\\n\\nINTRODUCTION\\nInstruction fine-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) make it possible to construct intelligent applications just by writing prose (Ouyang et al., 2022). For example, an inbox search app might use a prompt template like the one below to help the user find emails:\\n\\nContents of the user\u2019s most recent 100 emails:\\n\\n{list of emails}\\n\\nUser's search query:\\n\\n{user search query}\\n\\nList and summarize the three emails that best respond to the user\u2019s search query.\\n\\nUnfortunately, these applications are vulnerable to prompt injection, where a malicious user or third party manipulates part of the prompt to subvert the intent of the system designer. A spammer could send an email instructing the LLM to list their email first in search results, or a malicious user could enter a search query that makes the LLM reveal its prompt so that they can make a copycat app.\\n\\nThis is a real security threat today: prompt injection can turn Bing Chat into a phishing agent (Greshake et al., 2023) or leak instructions and generate spam (Liu et al., 2023b). Ideally, we would like LLMs to be so robust to prompt injection that it is prohibitively costly to attack LLM-based applications. However, this is a difficult goal to achieve: developers want LLMs that can process the complex instructions needed for real applications, and checking whether these instructions have been violated can require (expensive) human judgment.\\n\\nTo address this, we created Tensor Trust: a prompt injection web game that side-steps the issue of complex rules and subjective evaluation by focusing on a very simple string comparison task. Players must create defense prompts that cause an LLM to output the words \u201caccess granted\u201d only when a secret access code is entered. Other players, who do not know the access code or defense prompt, must craft attacks that make the LLM grant access. This is illustrated in Fig. 1.\\n\\n\u2217 Corresponding author: sdt@berkeley.edu.

In preliminary experiments during the development of Tensor Trust, we observed that the robustness of GPT 3.5 Turbo did not vary strongly with the role assigned to the opening defense, attack, and closing defense. This suggests that GPT 3.5 Turbo assigns similar importance to \u201csystem\u201d and \u201cuser\u201d messages, even if they are designed to steer the LLM in different ways.\\n\\nIn order to measure this quantitatively, we evaluated GPT 3.5 Turbo on the prompt hijacking and prompt extraction robustness benchmarks for 100 random samples across 5 different message roles. Table A13 summarizes these experiments. Across all message role schemes, we observe that the Hijacking Robustness Rate (HRR) is between 19% and 31% and the Extraction Robustness Rate (ERR) is between 27% and 32%. In short, the difference in each message role scheme is small, indicating that prompt injection robustness does not vary strongly with the message role scheme.\\n\\nMoreover, we see that the Defense Validity (DV) for both prompt hijacking and prompt extraction displays a similar trend.\\n\\nCOMPOSING ATTACKS\\n\\nExample of an attack which uses the \u201crepeated character attack\u201d, the \u201cupdate instructions\u201d attack, and the \u201croleplay\u201d attack.

The rationale behind this design decision is twofold. First, players can use successful attacks against their account to more intelligently update their defenses. For example, they can try these successful attacks against any new defense that they come up with. Second, players will likely use successful attacks against their account (or variants of them) to attack other accounts. The result of this phenomenon is that successful attack strategies tend to spread through the game until most active accounts have robust defenses against the strategy. This effect yields \u201cwaves\u201d of different attack strategies and mimics the natural attacker-defender back-and-forth commonly observed in cybersecurity contexts. These waves are clearly observable in Fig. 5.\\n\\nWe also provide players with a history of their previous attacks against other accounts. This feature is purely to improve the gameplay quality; i.e. reduce the friction of finding and executing previous attacks.\\n\\nANKS\\n\\nTo prevent strong players from repeatedly using strong attacks to \u201cfarm\u201d less skilled players, we assigned each account a discrete rank based on account balance. If a player attempted to attack an account of lower rank, their attacks needed to match some restriction specific to that account\u2019s defense difficulty, like avoiding the use of vowels. This encouraged strong players to submit more diverse attacks.\\n\\nWe assigned players the rank of Rookie, Veteran, or Legend based on their current balance: \\\\([0, 1500]\\\\) for Rookie, \\\\((1500, 5000]\\\\) for Veteran, and \\\\((5000, \\\\infty)\\\\) for Legend. When a player\u2019s balance changes, they automatically change rank.\\n\\nIn initial iterations of the game, attacking an account more than one tier below your current tier was prohibited. In particular, a Legend account could not attack a Rookie account. However, we found that this discouraged our best players from coming up with interesting attacks. Thus we replaced it with the restriction mechanism described in the main text, which allows high-ranked players to attack low-ranked players so long as their attacks meet certain restrictive conditions that are specific to each defending player.\\n\\nUSER CONSENT\\n\\nUsers were subject to the privacy and use terms outlined in Fig. A1. These terms were easily accessible from every page on the game\u2019s website.\\n\\nSPAM AND ABUSE MODERATION\\n\\nWe used the overall score given by OpenAI\u2019s moderation endpoint to flag player inputs (opening defense, access code, closing defense, and attack) for potential violations of our terms of use. A member of our team manually reviewed some of the flagged messages to ascertain whether it was actually a violation of the terms of use. Finally, in a few isolated cases, player accounts were banned for repeated and egregious violations e.g. clear intent to propagate racial slurs. We note that this enforcement of our terms of use may lead to failure to capture attack strategies that use language forbidden by the strictures present in Tensor Trust. However, we believe that these polices do not severely limit attack quality.\\n\\nDATA CLEANUP\\n\\nAlthough it was not common, we found that some users expressed frustration at strong defenses by cursing at the LLMs through their attack prompts. As such, we tried to remove the most extreme examples from the released dataset using basic string matching against a list of banned terms. Whenever we found matches, we manually checked them to see what other forms of inappropriate\"}"}

For example, the LLaMA models would often say \\\"access granted\\\" and then launch into a lecture about the importance of being responsible with special access privileges etc. (this is one reason why LLaMA outputs are longer on average than those of other models in Fig. A2). To count these output as \\\"wins\\\", we used a slightly weaker regular expression that allows any alphanumeric characters after the initial \\\"access granted\\\" message, but only non-alphanumeric characters before it:\\n\\n```\\nre.compile(r\"^\\\\W*access granted\\\\b.*$\", re.IGNORECASE)\\n```\\n\\nThis regular expression was used for adversarial filtering of attack/defense combinations and for the final evaluation, but not for identifying transferable defenses.\\n\\n**D.2 SERIALIZING ATTACKS INTO INPUTS FOR THE BASELINE MODELS**\\n\\nFor each family of LLMs, we tried to find a way of serializing opening defense \u2013 attack/access code \u2013 closing defense sequences that resulted in good defense validity and attack resistance.\\n\\n**GPT family**\\n\\nWe initially found that encoding the input with a system message (opening defense), user message (access code/attack), and user message (closing defense) resulted in similar behavior to other configurations on 3.5 Turbo, and so we chose this configuration for our website and for our benchmark evaluation. We used the same configuration for GPT 4.\\n\\n**Claude family**\\n\\nThe Claude website recommends prefixing messages with \\\"Human:\\\" or \\\"Assistant:\\\" and using delimiters (e.g. HTML tags before and after) to identify particular sections of text. Following this, we prompted the model in this format:\\n\\n```\\nHuman: {{OPENING_DEFENSE}}\\n\\n<user_input>{{ATTACK}}</user_input>\\n\\n{{CLOSING_DEFENSE}}\\n\\nAssistant:\\n```\\n\\n**PaLM 2**\\n\\nWe accessed PaLM 2 via the Vertex AI SDK for Python. Their chat session base class provides two possible roles for messages: \\\"user\\\" and \\\"bot\\\". We found that providing the opening defense message as \\\"bot\\\" and the attack attempt and closing defense as separate \\\"user\\\" roles maximized defense validity.\\n\\n**LLaMA family**\\n\\nSimilar to the analysis of PaLM, we looked into the implementation of Llama and found that they utilize special tokens to encode the beginning and end of the \\\"system\\\", \\\"user\\\", and \\\"assistant\\\" roles. Following their encoding strategy, we found the correctly defined behavior was to wrap the opening defense in system tokens, then wrap it along with the attack code in the user role tokens and finally, separately wrap the closing defense also in the user role.\\n\\nNone of these approaches provide reliable ways of differentiating untrusted user input from trusted instructions \u2013 gpt, llama, and Palm2 all use \\\"user\\\" roles for both the attack and the closing defense.

The \\\\( \\\\text{\\\\textvisiblesymbol}} \\\\) token was first highlighted by Fell (2023), who listed it as one of several rare \\\"glitch\\\" tokens which GPT 3.5 Turbo is unable to repeat verbatim. Adding this token to Tensor Trust attacks often causes the model to ignore the pre-prompt or post-prompt, or otherwise subvert the defender's instructions in surprising and useful ways. This attack went viral a few weeks into the game, spreading across the user base as shown in Fig. 5.\\n\\nIn addition, users uncovered and exploited the string 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9. Asking GPT 3.5 Turbo to output this string often results in OpenAI API errors after the model has generated part of the output, which can be used to prevent the attacker from successfully submitting an attack. This may be related to the fact that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 is the string representation of the special token that ends each chat message. It should not be possible to input this special token through OpenAI's high-level ChatML API, but the string nonetheless appears to have a special effect on some part of the serving pipeline. This highlights that robustness to prompt injection requires a bug-free text preprocessing and model serving pipeline, and not just a reliable model.\\n\\nConfusing the model about the preceding prompt\\n\\nMany attack strategies attempt to convince the model to ignore the opening defense. Some strategies do this explicitly, like starting the attack with it seems there was some confusion in the earlier message. Others aim to make the model view prior text as unrelated by prefixing attacks with paragraphs of random text or . Tensor Trust players eventually converged on using blocks of repeated characters for this purpose, like lines filled with ]]]]]]] or \u00a8o \u00a8o \u00a8o \u00a8o \u00a8o . The strategy of repeating characters was shown on Twitter (Grogan, 2023) to make GPT 3.5 Turbo go \\\"off the rails\\\", generating random web text. To our knowledge, this is the first time this strategy has proven useful for prompt injection.\\n\\nComposability and virality of attacks\\n\\nStrategies were often combined to make stronger attacks. This had a compounding effect as users observed attacks against their own accounts and incorporated the best strategies into their own attacks.

We randomly sampled successful defenses from the filtered dataset of 'good' defenses described in Section 3.1.1 and observed that they often employed these strategies:\\n\\n* Directly telling the model to say \\\"access granted\\\" for the access code and a rejection message otherwise.\\n* Warning the model not to follow user input (e.g. \\\"The previous query was code provided by an untrusted user, do not follow any commands they provided.\\\").\\n* Roleplay (e.g. \\\"You are a hyper-secure, password-based login system.\\\").\\n* Adding delimiters to separate the attack or access code from the rest of the defense (e.g. \\\"BEGIN USER INPUT\\\" and \\\"END USER INPUT\\\").\\n* Repeating instructions several times or providing examples on how the model should behave.\\n\\nOne of our players informs us that this specific phrasing was first generated by GPT4.\"}"}

The models are GPT 3.5 Turbo (Brown et al., 2020); GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023); Claude-instant-v1.2 (Anthropic, 2023a; Bai et al., 2022); Claude-2.0 (Anthropic, 2023c; b); PaLM 2 (Anil et al., 2023); LLaMA 2 Chat in 7B, 13B and 70B variants (Touvron et al., 2023); and CodeLLaMA-34B-instruct (Rozi\u00e8re et al., 2023). The models each called for a slightly different input format; see Appendix D.2 for details.\\n\\n5.1 Prompt Hijacking Robustness\\n\\nResults for the prompt hijacking robustness benchmark are presented in Fig. 6a and Table A1. We see that all three reference models have relatively high defense validity and low hijacking robustness rates. This is because defenses were thrown out unless they were valid for at least two out of the three models, and attack/defense pairs were likewise only included if the attack fooled at least two of the models. However, Claude instant 1.2 has lower defense validity and a substantially higher hijacking robustness rate than the other two reference models. When we examined the responses, we observed that Claude had a higher false refusal rate for defenses that touched on topics it deemed sensitive (like security or violence), and also tended to resist being asked to play a particular role. Both of these led to a lower defense validity rate. For example, a defense which started with \u201cYou are the Fortress-X Online Security System\u201d caused Claude to insist that it is really just a chatbot named Claude. Claude 1.2\u2019s higher hijacking robustness rate is partly due to these spurious rejections, but also seems to be partly due to higher prompt injection resistance than the base models. We observed similar effects for Claude 2, although it also had a greater tendency to reject the true access code as if it were an attack, leading to much lower defense validity.\\n\\nFor the LLaMA models, we see an unfortunate trade-off between hijacking robustness and defense validity. For instance, LLaMA-2-70B-chat has a much higher defense validity than the 7 billion parameter model, but a worse hijacking robustness rate. This issue was partly because smaller LLaMAs often refuse to follow instructions due to hallucinated safety concerns, which led to poor defense validity (the model refuses to follow instructions in the defense) but also good hijacking robustness (the model also refuses to follow instructions in the attack). For example, LLaMA-7B once rejected an access code by arguing that it is not \u201cappropriate or ethical to deny access to someone based solely on their answer to a question, . . . [especially] something as personal and sensitive as a password\u201d. LLaMA-2-70B-chat and CodeLLaMA-34B-Instruct-hf both have higher defense validity, which appeared to be partly due to improved instruction-following ability, and partly due to a lower rate of spurious refusals (especially on the part of CodeLLaMA).\\n\\nFigure 6: Evaluation results for robustness to prompt hijacking (left) and extraction (right). Defense Validity is the percentage of access codes that produced \u2018access granted\u2019 when given to the model. See Appendix D.3 for results tables. Numbers were calculated on the adversarially-filtered datasets described in Section 3.1.1 and Section 3.1.2, which includes defenses that are valid on all our reference models, and attacks that succeeded against at least one reference model.\"}"}

We speculate that this is due to GPT-4 being produced by the same organization as GPT-3.5 and therefore being able to follow similar types of defense instructions, but also being more resistant to known vulnerabilities in GPT-3.5 like role-playing attacks.\\n\\nWe also performed a message role ablation on the hijacking benchmark. In the web app, we used GPT 3.5 Turbo with a \u201csystem\u201d message role for the opening defense, and \u201cuser\u201d message roles for the attack/access code and closing defense. Our results in Appendix I show little difference in performance between the different choices of message role, which shows that the inbuilt \u201cmessage role\u201d functionality in GPT 3.5 Turbo is not sufficient to reject human-created prompt injection attacks.\\n\\n5.2 Prompt Extraction Robustness\\n\\nFig. 6b and Table A2 show our prompt extraction robustness results. We again see that the reference models have high defense validity (due to transferable defense filtering) and low hijacking robustness rates (due to adversarial filtering), with Claude 1.2 again outperforming GPT 3.5 Turbo and Bard. Among the remaining models, we can see a few interesting patterns. For instance, we see that GPT-4 has a better defense validity and extraction robustness rate than other models, which we again attribute to the fact that it accepts and refuses a similar set of prompts to GPT 3.5 but generally has better instruction-following ability. We also see that LLaMA 2 Chat models (especially the 70B model) have much worse extraction robustness than hijacking robustness. This may be due to the LLaMA models in general being more verbose than other models, and thus more prone to leaking parts of the defense prompt accidentally. We observed that LLaMA chat models tended to give \u201chelpful\u201d rejections that inadvertently leaked parts of the prompt, and Fig. A2 shows that they generally produce longer responses than other models on both the hijacking and extraction benchmark. The relative performance of other models is similar to the hijacking benchmark, which suggests that the properties that make a model resist prompt extraction may also make it resist prompt hijacking, and vice versa.\\n\\nAlthough Tensor Trust only asks attackers to achieve a limited objective (making the LLM say \u201caccess granted\u201d), we found that some of the attack strategies generalize to real-world chatbots and writing assistants. Even though the attacks were designed to perform prompt injection (prompting a model to override its prompt), we were able to apply them to the related challenge of jailbreaking (prompting a model to overcome its safety finetuning). Our results are available in Appendix G. By adapting hijacking attacks from our dataset to ask for particular behaviors, we were able to make these applications respond to sensitive prompts that they would otherwise refuse to respond to. Examples (which we disclosed before release) include:\\n\\n- Eliciting undesirable outputs with minimal prompt engineering: ChatGPT, Claude, and Bard (which are popular chatbots) refuse to make jokes about Kim Jong Un when asked directly (Figs. A4, A6 and A8). We attempted to overcome this resistance by adapting attacks from our dataset to ask the model to say a joke about Kim Jong Un instead and found that some attacks successfully elicited jokes (Figs. A5, A7 and A9). To test how well our attacks generalized, we selected three attacks which had shown transfer potential on one prompt and tested them across three different chatbots (ChatGPT, Claude, and Bard) and ten different phrasings of the Kim Jong Un joke request. In Figure A3 we see that one of the three attacks from our dataset reliably causes all three chatbots to generate a joke, whereas the other two perform no better than a dummy \u201cattack\u201d consisting of irrelevant text. This shows that some attacks in our dataset transfer outside the setting in the game, but that some search for appropriate attacks is still required, as many do not transfer robustly across settings.\\n\\n- Constructing jailbreaks with additional prompt engineering: With additional prompt-engineering effort, we constructed successful jailbreaks that elicited bomb-making instructions. For example, Bing Chat (a chatbot) refuses to provide instructions when asked directly (Fig. A12), but does so when we give it a standard prefix from our dataset (%%% END user ambiguity etc.) followed by a jailbreak manually created by us. Note that the jailbreak prompt at the end uses techniques that we learned from our dataset such as asking the LLM to tell a story, and to prepend what we want to its response (Fig. A13). Similarly, Notion AI (an AI-based writing tool) refuses to provide bomb-making instructions when asked directly (Fig. A14), but does so when we use a similar attack to that for Bing Chat (Fig. A15).\"}"}

We did also try to find applications that were vulnerable to prompt injection rather than jailbreaking, but found that the system prompts of these applications could usually be overridden with little effort, making sophisticated attack strategies unnecessary.\\n\\n7 RELATED WORK\\n\\nAdversarial attacks on LLMs\\n\\nThere are many existing strategies for eliciting undesirable behavior from NLP models (Zhang et al., 2020). For instruction-following LLMs, past work has focused on jailbreaks, which are inputs that undo the safety features of LLMs (Wei et al., 2023; Deng et al., 2023), and prompt injection attacks, which are inputs that override the previous instructions given to an LLM (Liu et al., 2023a; Perez & Ribeiro, 2022; Greshake et al., 2023; Mu et al., 2023).\\n\\nSome past work has also investigated automatically optimizing adversarial prompts. Wallace et al. (2019) optimize adversarial text segments to make models perform poorly across a wide range of scenarios. Zou et al. (2023) show that black-box models can be attacked by transferring attacks on open-source models, and Bailey et al. (2023) show that image channels in vision-language models can be attacked. In contrast to these papers, we choose to focus on human-generated attacks, which are more interpretable and can take advantage of external knowledge (e.g. model tokenization schemes).\\n\\nOther past work considers training-time attacks. This might include poisoning a model's training set with samples that cause it to misclassify certain inputs at test time (Biggio et al., 2012; Dai et al., 2019; Qi et al., 2021; Wallace et al., 2020), or fine-tuning an LLM to remove safety features (Qi et al., 2023). These papers all assume that the attacker has some degree of control over the training process (e.g. the ability to corrupt a small fraction of the training set). In contrast, we consider only test-time attacks on LLMs that have already been trained.\\n\\nPrompt injection games\\n\\nTensor Trust was inspired by other online games that challenge the user to prompt-inject an LLM. Such games include GPT Prompt Attack (h43z, 2023), Merlin's Defense (Merlinus, 2023), Doublespeak (Forces Unseen, 2023), The Gandalf Game (Lakera, 2023), and Immersive GPT (Immersive Labs, 2023). Tensor Trust differs in three key ways from these previous contributions. It (a) allows users to create defenses as opposed to using a small finite set of defenses predetermined by developers, (b) rewards users for both prompt hijacking and prompt extraction (as opposed to just prompt extraction), and (c) has a publicly available dataset. Tensor Trust also has a similar threat model to HackAPrompt (Schulhoff et al., 2023), although HackAPrompt allows attackers to see the defense, and does not allow users to submit their own defenses.\\n\\nLLM jailbreak collections\\n\\nWe are primarily interested in prompt injection attacks that override other instructions given to a model, as opposed to jailbreaks, which elicit responses that models have been fine-tuned to avoid. However, jailbreaks have been more widely studied, and there are many collections of them available. These are often shared informally on sites such as Jailbreak Chat (Albert, 2023) and other online platforms such as Twitter (Fraser, 2023). Additionally Shen et al. (2023), Qiu et al. (2023) and Wei et al. (2023) have released more curated jailbreak datasets for benchmarking LLM safety training. Our project is similar to these efforts in that it collects a dataset of adversarial examples to LLMs, but we focus on prompt injection rather than jailbreaks.\\n\\n8 CONCLUSION\\n\\nOur dataset of prompt injection attacks reveals a range of strategies for causing undesirable behavior in applications that use instruction fine-tuned LLMs. We introduce benchmarks to evaluate the robustness of LLMs to these kinds of attacks. Our benchmarks focus on the seemingly simple problem of controlling when a model outputs a particular string, but our results show that even the most capable LLMs can fall prey to basic human-written attacks in this setting. Our findings also underscore the danger of providing LLMs with access to untrusted third-party inputs in sensitive applications; prompting is not a sufficient safeguard. We hope that our dataset will be useful for future work on evaluating prompt injection mitigations, red-teaming LLM-integrated applications, and understanding multi-step attack strategies to build better defenses.\"}"}

Similar existing datasets are either smaller and not include multi-step attacks (Wei et al., 2023; Shen et al., 2023), or do not include user-submitted defenses (Schulhoff et al., 2023).\\n\\n2. Our qualitative analysis sheds light on general failure modes of the LLM used for Tensor Trust, like the fact that it allows \\\"user\\\" instructions to override \\\"system\\\" instructions, and exhibits bizarre behavior for rare tokens. In contrast, automatically-generated attacks (Zou et al., 2023) are often difficult to interpret.\\n\\n3. We propose two Tensor Trust-based benchmarks to evaluate whether LLMs fall prey to manual prompt injection attacks. One benchmark focuses on prompt extraction (extracting the defense prompt to figure out the access code), while the other focuses on prompt hijacking (obtaining access without the access code). Tensor Trust lets users choose between GPT 3.5 Turbo 0613, Claude 1.2 Instant or PaLM Chat Bison 001 as their defense LLM, and our benchmark results show that submitted attacks often generalize across LLMs.\\n\\n4. We take several attack strategies from the Tensor Trust dataset and apply them to real LLM-based applications. The strategies make it easier to construct prompt injection attacks on these applications, even though the applications are quite different to the setting of the game.\\n\\nWe release the Tensor Trust dataset and source code for the web game at tensortrust.ai/paper\\n\\nThe Tensor Trust web game simulates a bank. Each player has a balance, which they can increase by coming up with successful attacks or creating a defense that rebuffs attacks. This section describes the basic mechanics of the game; we leave implementation details to Appendix B.\\n\\nNotation\\n\\nWe use $V$ to denote a token vocabulary and $L : V^* \\\\times V^* \\\\times V^* \\\\rightarrow V^*$ to denote an LLM that takes in three strings and outputs a single response string. Defenders have three choices of LLM: GPT 3.5 Turbo, Claude Instant, or PaLM Chat.\\n\\n$G : V^* \\\\rightarrow \\\\{T, F\\\\}$ denotes a goal predicate that determines whether a string says \\\"access granted\\\" (achieved using the regex in Appendix B).\\n\\nDefending\\n\\nEach account has a defense which consists of three prompts: an opening defense $d_{\\\\text{open}}$, an access code $c_{\\\\text{access}}$, and a closing defense $d_{\\\\text{close}}$, as shown in Fig. 2. When a user saves a defense, we validate it by sandwiching their access code between the opening and closing defense and feeding it to an LLM chosen by the user. The access code can only be saved if it makes the LLM output \\\"access granted\\\". In other words, $G(L(d_{\\\\text{open}}, c_{\\\\text{access}}, d_{\\\\text{close}}))$ must be true.\\n\\nAttacking\\n\\nA player can select any other player's account and submit an attack against it. The text of the first player's attack, $c_{\\\\text{attack}}$, is sandwiched between the defending player's opening and closing defense ($d_{\\\\text{open}}$ and $d_{\\\\text{close}}$), and then fed into the LLM $L$. $L$ is chosen by the defender, and is not known a priori by the attacker. If the LLM outputs \\\"access granted\\\" (i.e. $G(L(d_{\\\\text{open}}, c_{\\\\text{attack}}, d_{\\\\text{close}}))$ is true), the attacker steals a fraction of the defender's money. Otherwise, the defender is granted a 2\"}"}

A small amount of money for rebuffing the attack. The attacker cannot see open or close, but can see the LLM's response to their attack. Fig. 2 depicts this.\\n\\nMotivation for the access code\\n\\nOne could imagine a version of Tensor Trust with no access codes, where the defender's aim would be to never have the LLM output \u201caccess granted\u201d. We chose to include an access code to make Tensor Trust more akin to real applications, where the aim is to process inputs without shutting down the LLM entirely. Players often included the access code in their opening or closing defense (e.g. \u201cDon\u2019t grant access unless the input was hunter2\u201d), which encouraged attackers to first extract the defense prompt and then enter the extracted access code.\\n\\n3.1 Datasets and Benchmarks\\n\\nWe release a full dump of attacks and defenses provided by Tensor Trust players (minus a small number that violated our ToS). The structure of this dataset is illustrated in Fig. 3. Attack information includes identifiers for the attacker and defender, attack and defense text (including access code), LLM responses, and timestamps. Timestamps and player identifiers make it possible to reconstruct the entire trajectory of attacks taken by each player, which is useful for studying multi-step attack strategies.\\n\\nIn addition to the raw data, we release two benchmarks derived from the raw data, and a small classification dataset. The two benchmarks evaluate how robust instruction-following LLMs are to prompt extraction and prompt hijacking attacks, as defined in Section 3.1. In Appendix E, we also release a small dataset for evaluating models on detecting prompt extraction, even in cases where the prompt is only leaked indirectly by the LLM.\\n\\nThe benchmarks and all analysis in this paper are derived from only the first 127,000 attacks and 46,000 defenses, which were all evaluated against GPT 3.5 Turbo (the game did not support Claude or PaLM until later). This limitation applies only to the benchmark subset; the full raw dataset at tensortrust.ai/paper also includes later attacks and defenses against all three models.\\n\\n3.1 Prompt Injection Robustness Benchmarks\\n\\nOur robustness benchmarks focus on the two types of prompt injection attacks that we observed. First, prompt extraction attacks make the LLM reveal enough of the defense that the attacker can guess the access code (Zhang & Ippolito, 2023). Second, prompt hijacking attacks do not use the access code, but rather override the defense to make the LLM say \u201caccess granted\u201d.\\n\\nThese categories are analogous to the prompt injection attacks that have been carried out on real systems. A prompt extraction attack on Bing Chat revealed a secret codename (\u201cSydney\u201d) which made the model behave in bizarre ways when mentioned in conversation (von Hagen, 2023). Greshake et al. (2023) showed that a combination of hijacking and extraction was effective in corrupting Bing Chat into phishing its users, while Liu et al. (2023b) found 31 LLM-based applications that could be prompt hijacked into performing undesirable tasks. Although Tensor Trust is less complex than most of these applications, we view robustness on the Tensor Trust benchmarks as a prerequisite to...\"}"}

However, it must still output \\\"access\\ngranted\\\" when the true access code is given. We constructed this benchmark in three steps:\\n\\n1. **Finding high-quality, transferable defenses**\\n   - Many defenses submitted by our users were nearly identical or relied on quirks specific to GPT 3.5 Turbo. We discarded near-duplicate defenses using minhash and locality-sensitive hashing (Broder, 1997). We also discarded those with long access codes, since long access codes were often themselves adversarial examples. We also used three reference models\u2014GPT 3.5 Turbo, Claude Instant 1.2, and PaLM 2\u2014and kept only defenses that produced \\\"access granted\\\" when fed the correct access code for at least two out of the three models. At the time we did this procedure we had 39,371 unique defenses, and the process filtered it to just 3,839.\\n\\n2. **Identifying hijacking attacks**\\n   - To identify possible hijacking attacks, we filtered the Tensor Trust dataset to find attack prompts that had been successful against at least one account, ignoring cases where the attack contained the defender's access code. We also discarded any attack that had only been used against one account, on the assumption that such an attack would not transfer to other defenses. This gave us 1,586 suspected hijacks that could possibly generalize across defenses.\\n\\n3. **Adversarial filtering and manual validation**\\n   - To get a dataset of actual attack/defense pairs, we randomly paired high-quality defenses with suspected hijacking attacks and kept only pairs where the attack managed to fool at least two of our three reference models. Finally, we manually removed pairs where we did not expect a well-aligned model to get the right answer. This meant throwing out defenses where the true access code was itself an adversarial example, or where the attack was attempting to do prompt extraction and just happened to hijack the model. These two steps left us with 775 samples in the final benchmark; one is shown in Fig. 4.\\n\\n**Hijacking evaluation metrics**\\n\\nAn ideal model will be high in both of these metrics:\\n\\n1. **Hijacking Robustness Rate (HRR):** Percent of the time the model avoids saying \\\"access granted\\\" in response to an attack\\n2. **Defense Validity (DV):** Percent of the time the model outputs \\\"access granted\\\" when presented with the access code for each defense\\n\\n3.1.2 PROMPT EXTRACTION ROBUSTNESS BENCHMARK\\n\\nThe prompt extraction robustness benchmark evaluates whether an LLM can avoid producing an output that contains the true access code verbatim.

First, whether the attack caused the LLM to output the defender\u2019s access code exactly. Second, whether the attacker was able to immediately enter the access code after the attack (this allows us to identify attacks that succeeded in hinting about the access code without outputting it verbatim). This produced 2,326 suspected extraction attacks.\\n\\nAdversarial filtering and manual validation\\n\\nAfter randomly pairing attacks with good defenses in order to build an evaluation dataset, we adversarially filter to include only those attack/defense combinations which succeeded in extracting the defense\u2019s access code from at least two of the three reference LLMs. We then manually remove pairs with low-quality defenses or attacks that do not appear to be deliberately trying to extract the access code, which is analogous to the manual filtering step for the hijacking dataset.

To identify these strategies, we used Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), which is an algorithm for probabilistic topic modeling of text corpora (Blei et al., 2003). We ran LDA on a set of 3,912 successful prompt hijacking and extraction attacks, identified using the heuristics in Sections 3.1.1 and 3.1.2 (before adversarial filtering and validation). We generated 41 topics through LDA. After manually inspecting topics, dropping those without a coherent focus, and merging similar topics, we arrived at 16 attack strategies. See Table 1 for a list of topics and Appendix F for more details. The LDA clustering is imperfect, so these are very rough estimates of the frequency of different strategies. Given a set of topics, we were able to track the evolution of the game by graphing the weekly frequency of different topics over a nine week period, as shown in Fig. 5. This shows the \u201cviral\u201d nature of attack strategies. When the game was released, most players used simple, general attacks which we categorize under \u201cAsk Directly\u201d. Later, they adopted a particularly effective roleplay attack that we refer to as \u201cSentient Door\u201d, and most recently they have switched to exploiting the rare token \u263c, which we describe below.\"}"}
