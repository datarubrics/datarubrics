Beyond these domain-specific datasets and benchmarks, physics-informed machine learning has received considerable attention (Hao et al., 2022; Cuomo et al., 2022) since the advent of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) (Raissi et al., 2019). These methods successfully incorporate physical laws into model training, demonstrating immense potential across a variety of scientific and engineering domains. Various papers have compared different components within the PINN framework; for instance, (Das & Tesfamariam, 2022) and (Wu et al., 2023) investigate the sampling methods of collocation points in PINNs, and (Bischof & Kraus, 2021) compare reweighting techniques for different loss components. PDEBench (Takamoto et al., 2022) and PDEArena (Gupta & Brandstetter, 2022) design multiple tasks to compare different methods in scientific machine learning such as PINNs, FNO, and U-Net. Nevertheless, a comprehensive comparison of various PINN approaches remains absent in the literature.\\n\\n2.2 SOFTWARE AND TOOLBOXES\\n\\nA plethora of software solutions have been developed for solving PDEs with neural networks. These include SimNet (Hennigh et al., 2021), NeuralPDE (Rackauckas & Nie, 2017), TorchDiffEq (Chen et al., 2020), and PyDEns (Khudorozhkov et al., 2019). More recently, DeepXDE (Lu et al., 2021) has been introduced as a fundamental library for implementing PINNs across different backends. However, there remains a void for a toolbox that provides a unified implementation for advanced PINN variants. Our PINNacle fills this gap by offering a flexible interface that facilitates the implementation and evaluation of diverse PINN variants. We furnish clear and concise code for researchers to execute benchmarks across all problems and methods.\\n\\n2.3 VARIANTS OF PHYSICS-INFORMED NEURAL NETWORKS\\n\\nThe PINNs have received much attention due to their remarkable performance in solving both forward and inverse PDE problems.

Broadly speaking, these variants can be categorized into: loss reweighting/resampling (Wang et al., 2021a;b; Tang et al., 2021; Wu et al., 2023; Nabian et al., 2021), innovative optimizers (Yao et al., 2023), novel loss functions such as variational formulations (Yu et al., 2018; Kharazmi et al., 2019; 2021; Khodayi-Mehr & Zavlanos, 2020) or regularization terms (Yu et al., 2022; Son et al., 2021), and novel architectures like domain decomposition (Jagtap & Karniadakis, 2021; Li et al., 2019; Moseley et al., 2021; Jagtap et al., 2020c) and adaptive activations (Jagtap et al., 2020b;a).

The last term is data loss, which is optional when there is data available. However, PINNs have several inherent drawbacks. First, PINNs optimize a mixture of imbalance loss terms which might hinder its convergence as illustrated in (Wang et al., 2021a). Second, nonlinear or stiff PDEs might lead to unstable optimization (Wang et al., 2021b). Third, the vanilla MLPs might have difficulty in representing multi-scale or high-dimensional functions. For example, (Krishnapriyan et al., 2021) shows that vanilla PINNs only work for a small parameter range, even in a simple convection problem. To resolve these challenges, numerous variants of PINNs are proposed. However, a comprehensive comparison of these methods is lacking, and thus it is imperative to develop a benchmark.\\n\\n3.2 DATASETS\\n\\nTo effectively compare PINN variants, we've curated a set of PDE problems (datasets) representing a wide range of challenges. We chose PDEs from diverse domains, reflecting their importance in science and engineering. Our dataset includes 22 unique cases, with further details in Appendix B.\\n\\n\u2022 The Burgers\u2019 Equation, fundamental to fluid mechanics, considering both one and two-dimensional problems.\\n\u2022 The Poisson\u2019s Equation, widely used in math and physics, with four different cases.\\n\u2022 The Heat Equation, a time-dependent PDE that describes diffusion or heat conduction, demonstrated in four unique cases.\\n\u2022 The Navier-Stokes Equation, describing the motion of viscous fluid substances, showcased in three scenarios: a lid-driven flow (NS2d-C), a geometrically complex backward step flow (NS2d-CG), and a time-dependent problem (NS2d-LT).\\n\u2022 The Wave Equation, modeling wave behavior, exhibited in three cases.\\n\u2022 Chaotic PDEs, featuring two popular examples: the Gray-Scott (GS) and Kuramoto-Sivashinsky (KS) equations.\\n\u2022 High Dimensional PDEs, including the high-dimensional Poisson equation (PNd) and the high-dimensional diffusion or heat equation (HNd).\\n\u2022 Inverse Problems, focusing on the reconstruction of the coefficient field from noisy data for the Poisson equation (PInv) and the diffusion equation (HInv).\\n\\nIt is important to note that we have chosen PDEs encompassing a wide range of mathematical properties. This ensures that the benchmarks do not favor a specific type of PDE. The selected PDE problems introduce several core challenges, which include:\\n\\n\u2022 Complex Geometry: Many PDE problems involve complex or irregular geometry, such as heat conduction or wave propagation around obstacles. These complexities pose significant challenges for PINNs in terms of accurate boundary behavior representation.\\n\u2022 Multi-Scale Phenomena: Multi-scale phenomena, where the solution varies significantly over different scales, are prevalent in situations such as turbulent fluid flow. Achieving a balanced representation across all scales is a challenge for PINNs in multi-scale scenarios.\\n\u2022 Nonlinear Behavior: Many PDEs exhibit nonlinear or even chaotic behavior, where minor variations in initial conditions can lead to substantial divergence in outcomes. The optimization of PINNs becomes intriguing on nonlinear PDEs.\\n\u2022 High Dimensionality: High-dimensional PDE problems, frequently encountered in quantum mechanics, present significant challenges for PINNs due to the \u201ccurse of dimensionality\u201d. This term refers to the increase in computational complexity with the addition of each dimension, accompanied by statistical issues like data sparsity in high-dimensional space.\"}"}

Then we present the high-level structure of our PINNacle.\\n\\n#### 3.3 METHODS\\n\\nAs mentioned above, variants of PINNs are mainly based on loss functions, architecture, and optimizer (Hao et al., 2022). The modifications to loss functions can be divided into reweighting existing losses and developing novel loss functions like regularization and variational formulation. Variants of architectures include using domain decomposition and adaptive activations.\\n\\nThe methods discussed are directly correlated with the challenges highlighted in Table 1. For example, domain decomposition methods are particularly effective for problems involving complex geometries and multi-scale phenomena. Meanwhile, loss reweighting strategies are adept at addressing imbalances in problems with multiple losses. We have chosen variants from these categories based on their significant contributions to the field. Here, we list the primary categories and representative methods as summarized in Table 2:\\n\\n- **Loss reweighting/Resampling (2\u223c4)**: PINNs are trained with a mixed loss of PDE residuals, boundary conditions, and available data losses shown in Eq 3. Various methods (Wang et al., 2021a; 2022b; Bischof & Kraus, 2021; Maddu et al., 2022; Rohrhofer et al., 2021) propose different strategies to adjust these weights $w_c$, $w_b$ and $w_d$ at different epochs or resample collocation points $\\\\{x_i^c\\\\}$ and $\\\\{x_i^b\\\\}$ in Eq 3, which indirectly adjust the weights (Wu et al., 2023; Nabian et al., 2021). We choose three famous examples, i.e., reweighting using gradient norms (PINN-LRA) (Wang et al., 2021a), using neural tangent kernel (PINN-NTK) (Wang et al., 2022b), and residual-based resampling (RAR)(Lu et al., 2021; Wu et al., 2023).\\n\\n- **Novel optimizer (5)**: To handle the problem of multi-scale objectives, some new optimizers (Liu et al., 2022; Yao et al., 2023) are proposed. We chose MultiAdam, which is resistant to domain scale changes.\\n\\n- **Novel loss functions (6\u223c7)**: Some works introduce novel loss functions like variational formulation (Sirignano & Spiliopoulos, 2018; Khodayi-Mehr & Zavlanos, 2020; Kharazmi et al., 2021) and regularization terms to improve training. We choose hp-VPINN (Kharazmi et al., 2021) and gPINN (Yu et al., 2022; Son et al., 2021), which are representative examples from these two categories.\\n\\n- **Novel activation architectures (8\u223c10)**: Some works propose various network architectures, such as using CNN and LSTM (Zhang et al., 2020; Gao et al., 2021; Ren et al., 2022),\"}"}

It is helpful for solving multi-scale problems, but multiple subnetworks increase the difficulty of training. XPINNs, cPINNs, and FBPINNs (Jagtap & Karniadakis, 2021; Jagtap et al., 2020c; Moseley et al., 2021) are three representative examples. We choose FBPINNs which is the state-of-the-art domain decomposition that applies domain-specific normalization to stabilize training.\\n\\n3.3.2 STRUCTURE OF TOOLBOX\\n\\nWe provide a user-friendly and concise toolbox for implementing, training, and evaluating diverse PINN variants. Specifically, our codebase is based on DeepXDE and provides a series of encapsulated classes and functions to facilitate high-level training and custom PDEs. These utilities allow for a standardized and streamlined approach to the implementation of various PINN variants and PDEs. Moreover, we provided many auxiliary functions, including computing different metrics, visualizing predictions, and recording results.\\n\\nDespite the unified implementation of diverse PINNs, we also design an adaptive multi-GPU parallel training framework to enhance the efficiency of systematic evaluations of PINN methods. It addresses the parallelization phase of training on multiple tasks, effectively balancing the computational loads of multiple GPUs. It allows for the execution of larger and more complex tasks. In a nutshell, we provide an example code for training and evaluating PINNs on two Poisson equations using our PINNacle framework in Appendix D.\\n\\n3.4 EVALUATION\\n\\nTo comprehensively analyze the discrepancy between the PINN solutions and the true solutions, we adopt multiple metrics to evaluate the performance of the PINN variants. Generally, we choose several metrics that are commonly used in literature that apply to all methods and problems. We suppose that $y = (y_i)_{i=1}^n$ is the prediction and $y' = (y'_i)_{i=1}^n$ is the ground truth, where $n$ is the number of testing examples. Specifically, we use $\\\\ell_2^2$ relative error ($L_2RE$), and $\\\\ell_1$ relative error ($L_1RE$) which are two most commonly used metrics to measure the global quality of the solution,\\n\\n$$L_2RE = \\\\frac{\\\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - y'_i)^2}{\\\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y'_i)^2}$$\\n$$L_1RE = \\\\frac{\\\\sum_{i=1}^{n} |y_i - y'_i|}{\\\\sum_{i=1}^{n} |y'_i|}.$$  \\\\hspace{1cm} (4)\\n\\nWe also compute max error (mERR in short), mean square error (MSE), and Fourier error (fMSE) for a detailed analysis of the prediction. These three metrics are computed as follows:\\n\\n$$MSE = \\\\frac{1}{n} \\\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - y'_i)^2,$$\\n$$mERR = \\\\max_{i} |y_i - y'_i|,$$\\n$$fMSE = \\\\frac{1}{k_{max} - k_{min} + 1} \\\\sqrt{\\\\sum_{k=k_{min}}^{k_{max}} |F(y) - F(y')|^2},$$  \\\\hspace{1cm} (5)\\n\\nwhere $F$ denotes Fourier transform of $y$ and $k_{min}, k_{max}$ are chosen similar to PDEBench (Takamoto et al., 2022). Besides, for time-dependent problems, investigating the quality of the solution with time is important. Therefore we compute the $L_2RE$ error varying with time in Appendix E.2.\\n\\nWe assess the performance of PINNs against the reference from numerical solvers. Experimental results utilizing the $\\\\ell_2$ relative error ($L_2RE$) metric are incorporated within the main text, while a more exhaustive set of results, based on the aforementioned metrics, is available in the Appendix E.1.\"}"}

Except for the ablation study in Sec 4.3 and Appendix E.2, we use a learning rate of 0.001 and train all models with 20,000 epochs. We repeat all experiments three times and record the mean and std. Table 3 presents the main results for all methods on our tasks and shows their average $\\\\ell_2$ relative errors (with standard deviation results available in Appendix E.1).\\n\\nPINN. We use PINN-w to denote training PINNs with larger boundary weights. The vanilla PINNs struggle to accurately solve complex physics systems, indicating substantial room for improvement. Using an $\\\\ell_2$ relative error (L2RE) of 10% as a threshold for a successful solution, we find that vanilla PINN only solves 10 out of 22 tasks, most of which involve simpler equations (e.g., 1.45% on Burgers-1d-C). They encounter significant difficulties when faced with physics systems characterized by complex geometries, multi-scale phenomena, nonlinearity, and longer time spans. This shows that directly optimizing an average of the PDE losses and initial/boundary condition losses leads to critical issues such as loss imbalance, suboptimal convergence, and limited expressiveness.\\n\\nPINN variants. PINN variants offer approaches to addressing some of these challenges to varying degrees. Methods involving loss reweighting and resampling have shown improved performance in some cases involving complex geometries and multi-scale phenomena (e.g., 1.43% on Poisson-2d-CG). This is due to the configuration of loss weights and sampled collocation points, which adaptively place more weight on more challenging domains during the training process. However, these methods still struggle with Wave equations, Navier-Stokes equations, and other cases with higher dimensions or longer time spans. MultiAdam, a representative of novel optimizers, solves several simple cases and the chaotic GS equation (9.37%), but does not significantly outperform other methods. The new loss term of variational form demonstrates significant superiority in solving inverse problems (e.g., 1.19% on HInv for vPINN), but no clear improvement in fitting error over standard PINN in forward cases. Changes in architecture can enhance expressiveness and flexibility for cases with complex geometries and multi-scale systems. For example, FBPINN achieves the smallest error on the chaotic GS equation (7.99%), while LAAF delivers the best fitting result on Heat-2d-CG (2.39%).\"}"}

We **bold** the best results across all methods.\\n\\n**Discussion.** For challenges related to complex geometries and multi-scale phenomena, some methods can mitigate these issues by implementing mechanisms like loss reweighting, novel optimizers, and better capacity through adaptive activation. This holds true for the 2D cases of Heat and Poisson equations, which are classic linear equations. However, when systems have higher dimensions (Poisson3d-CG) or longer time spans (Heat2d-LT), all methods fail to solve, highlighting the difficulties associated with complex geometries and multi-scale systems.\\n\\nIn contrast, nonlinear, long-time PDEs like 2D Burgers, NS, and KS pose challenges for most methods. These equations are sensitive to initial conditions, resulting in complicated solution spaces and more local minima for PINNs (Steger et al., 2022). The Wave equation, featuring a second-order time derivative and periodic behavior, is particularly hard for PINNs, which often become unstable and may violate conservation laws (Jagtap et al., 2020c; Wang et al., 2022a). Although all methods perform well on Poisson-Nd, only PINN with LBFGS solves Heat-Nd, indicating the potential of a second-order optimizer for solving high dimensional PDEs (Tang et al., 2021).\\n\\n**4.2 Parameterized PDE Experiments**\\n\\nThe performance of PINNs is also highly influenced by parameters in PDEs (Krishnapriyan et al., 2021). To investigate whether PINNs could handle a class of PDEs, we design this experiment to solve the same PDEs with different parameters. We choose 6 PDEs, i.e., Burgers2d-C, Poisson2d-C, Heat2d-MS, NS-C, Wave1d-C, and Heat-Nd (HNd), with each case containing five parameterized examples. Details of the parametrized PDEs are shown in Appendix B. Here we report the average L2RE metric on these parameterized PDEs for every case, and results are shown in the following Table 4. First, we see that compared with the corresponding cases in Table E.1, the mean L2RE of parameterized PDEs is usually higher. We suggest that this is because there are some difficult cases under certain parameters for these PDEs with very high errors. Secondly, we find that PINN-NTK works well on parameterized PDE tasks which achieve three best results among all six experiments. We speculate that solving PDEs with different parameters requires different weights for loss terms, and PINN-NTK is a powerful method for automatically balancing these weights.\\n\\n**4.3 Hyperparameter Analysis**\\n\\nThe performance of PINNs is strongly affected by hyperparameters, with each variant potentially introducing its own unique set. Here we aim to investigate the impact of several shared and method-specific hyperparameters via ablation studies. We consider the batch size and the number of training epochs. The corresponding results are shown in Figure 2. We focus on a set of problems, i.e., Burgers1d, GS, Heat2d-CG, and Poisson2d-C. Detailed numerical results and additional findings are in Appendix E.2.\\n\\n**Batch Size.** The left figure of Figure 18 shows the testing L2RE of PINNs for varying batch sizes. It suggests that larger batch sizes provide superior results, possibly due to improved gradient estimation accuracy. Despite the GS and Poisson2d-C witnessing saturation beyond a batch size of 2048, amplifying the batch sizes generally enhances results for the remaining problems.\\n\\n**Training Epochs.** The right figure of Figure 18 illustrates the L2RE of PINNs across varying training epochs. Mirroring the trend observed with batch size, we find that an increase in epochs leads to a decrease in overall error. However, the impact of the number of epochs also has a saturation point. Notably, beyond 20k or 80k epochs, the error does not decrease significantly, suggesting convergence of PINNs around 20\\n\\n\\\\[ \\\\sim 80 \\\\] epochs.\"}"}

The performance of standard PINNs under various learning rates and learning rate schedules is shown in Figure 3. We observe that the influence of the learning rate on performance is intricate, with optimal learning rates varying across problems. Furthermore, PINN training tends to be unstable. High learning rates, such as $10^{-2}$, often lead to error spikes, while low learning rates, like $10^{-5}$, result in slow convergence. Our findings suggest that a moderate learning rate, such as $10^{-3}$ or $10^{-4}$, or a step decay learning rate schedule, tends to yield more stable performance.\\n\\nCONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION\\n\\nIn this work, we introduced PINNacle, a comprehensive benchmark offering a user-friendly toolbox that encompasses over 10 PINN methods. We evaluated these methods against more than 20 challenging PDE problems, conducting extensive experiments and ablation studies for hyperparameters. Looking forward, we plan to expand the benchmark by integrating additional state-of-the-art methods and incorporating more practical problem scenarios.\\n\\nOur analysis of the experimental results yields several key insights. First, domain decomposition is beneficial for addressing problems characterized by complex geometries, and PINN-NTK is a strong method for balancing loss weights as experiments show. Second, the choice of hyperparameters is crucial to the performance of PINNs. Selecting a larger batch size and appropriately weighting losses or betas in Adam may significantly reduce the error. However, the best hyperparameters usually vary with PDEs. Third, we identify high-dimensional and nonlinear problems as a pressing challenge. The overall performance of PINNs is not yet on par with traditional numerical methods (Grossmann et al., 2023). Fourth, from a theoretical standpoint, the exploration of PINNs\u2019 loss landscape during the training of high-dimensional or nonlinear problems remains largely unexplored. Finally, from an algorithmic perspective, integrating the strengths of neural networks with numerical methods like preconditioning, weak formulation, and multigrid may present a promising avenue toward overcoming the challenges identified herein (Markidis, 2021).\"}"}
