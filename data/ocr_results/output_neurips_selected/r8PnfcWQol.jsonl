Therefore, an appropriate dataset is fundamental to both obtaining and evaluating such methods under this paradigm. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive framework for data generation, model training, and method evaluation that covers the combinatorial space of Existential First-order Queries with multiple variables (EFO\\\\textsubscript{k}). The combinatorial query space in our framework significantly extends those defined by set operations in the existing literature. Additionally, we construct a dataset, EFO\\\\textsubscript{k}-CQA, with 741 query types for empirical evaluation, and our benchmark results provide new insights into how query hardness affects the results. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the existing dataset construction process is systematically biased and hinders the appropriate development of query-answering methods, highlighting the importance of our work.

This task ambitiously aims to answer database-level complex queries described by logical complex connectives (conjunction $\\\\land$, disjunction $\\\\lor$, and negation $\\\\neg$) and quantifiers\\\\(^1\\\\) (existential $\\\\exists$) \\\\[37, 27, 18\\\\]. Currently, learning-based methods dominate the CQA tasks because they can empirically generalize to unseen knowledge as well as prevent the resource-demanding symbolic search.\\n\\nThe thriving of learning-based methods also puts an urgent request on high-quality benchmarks, including datasets with comprehensive coverage of queries and sound answers, and fair evaluation protocol for learning-based approaches. In the previous study, datasets are developed by progressively expanding the syntactical expressiveness, where conjunction \\\\[13\\\\], union \\\\[26\\\\], negation \\\\[28\\\\], and other operators \\\\[20\\\\] are taken into account sequentially.

This practical technique has been used in many previous research [22, 27]. Therefore, we only discuss conjunctive formulas in the rest of this paper.\\n\\n### 2.2 Constraint satisfaction problem for EFO queries\\n\\nFormally, a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) $\\\\mathcal{P}$ can be represented by a triple $\\\\mathcal{P} = (X, D, C)$ where $X = (v_1, \\\\cdots, v_n)$ is an $n$-tuple of variables, $D = (D_1, \\\\cdots, D_n)$ is the corresponding $n$-tuple of domains, $C = (C_1, \\\\cdots, C_t)$ is $t$-tuple constraint, each constraint $C_i$ is a pair of $(S_i, R_{S_i})$ where $S_i$ is a set of variables $S_i = \\\\{v_{i_j}\\\\}$ and $R_{S_i}$ is the constraint over those variables [29].\\n\\nHistorically, there are strong parallels between CSP and conjunctive queries in knowledge bases [10, 17]. The terms correspond to the variable set $X$. The domain $D_i$ of a constant entity contains only itself, while it is the whole entity set $\\\\mathcal{E}$ for other variables. Each constraint $C_i$ is binary that is induced by an atomic formula or its negation, for example, for an atomic formula $r(h, t)$, we have $S_i = \\\\{h, t\\\\}$, $R_{S_i} = \\\\{(h, t)|h, t \\\\in \\\\mathcal{E}, (h, r, t) \\\\in \\\\mathcal{KG}\\\\}$. Finally, by the definition of existential quantifier, we only consider the answer of free variables, rather than tracking all terms within the existential formulas.\\n\\n**Definition 9** (CSP answer of conjunctive formula). For a conjunctive formula $\\\\gamma$ in Equation 2 with $k$ free variables and $n$ existential variables, the answer set, $\\\\overline{A}$, of it formulated as CSP instance is:\\n\\n$$\\\\overline{A}[\\\\gamma(y_1, \\\\cdots, y_k)] = \\\\mathcal{A}[\\\\gamma^*(y_1, \\\\cdots, y_{n+k})],$$\\n\\nwhere $\\\\gamma^* = \\\\rho_{i1} \\\\land \\\\cdots \\\\land \\\\rho_{it}$.\\n\\nThis shows that the inference of existential formulas is easier than solving CSP instances since the existential variables do not need to be kept track of.\"}"]}

This method allows for the recursive computation from constant entity to the final answer set in a bottom-up manner [28]. We also provide full details of the operator tree and tree-form query in Appendix C. However, this representation method is inherently directed, acyclic, and simple, therefore more recent research breaks these constraints by being bidirectional [21, 37] or being cyclic or multi graph [39]. To meet these new requirements, they propose to represent the formula by the query graph [39], which inherits the convention of constraint network in representing CSP instance. We utilize this design and further extend it to represent EFO\\\\(_k\\\\) formula that contains multiple free variables. We provide the illustration and comparison of the operator tree and the query graph in Figure 1 where we show the strong expressiveness of the query graph. We also provide the formal definition of query graph as follows:\\n\\n**Definition 10 (Query graph).** Let \\\\( \\\\gamma \\\\) be a conjunctive formula in equation 2, its query graph is defined by \\\\( G(\\\\gamma) = \\\\{(h, r, t, \\\\{T/F\\\\})\\\\} \\\\), where an atomic formula \\\\( r(h, t) \\\\) in \\\\( \\\\gamma \\\\) corresponds to \\\\( (h, r, t, T) \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\neg r(h, t) \\\\) corresponds to \\\\( (h, r, t, F) \\\\).\\n\\nTherefore, any conjunctive formulas can be represented by a query graph, in the rest of the paper, we use query graphs and conjunctive formulas interchangeably.\\n\\n3 The combinatorial space of EFO\\\\(_k\\\\) queries\\n\\nAlthough previous research has given a systematic investigation in the combinatorial space of operator trees [36], the combinatorial space of the query graph is much more challenging due to the extremely large search space and the lack of explicit recursive formulation. To tackle this issue on a strong theoretical background, we put forward additional assumptions to exclude trivial query graphs. Such assumptions or restrictions also exist in the previous dataset and benchmark [28, 36]. Specifically, we propose to split the task of generating data into two levels, the abstract level, and the grounded level. At the abstract level, we create abstract query graph, at the grounded level, we provide the abstract query graph with the relation and constant and instantiate it as a query graph. In this section, we elaborate on how we investigate the scope of the nontrivial EFO\\\\(_k\\\\) query of interest step by step.\\n\\n3.1 Nontrivial abstract query graph of EFO\\\\(_k\\\\)\\n\\nThe abstract query graph is the ungrounded query graph without information of certain knowledge graphs, and we give an example in Figure 3\\n\\n**Definition 11 (Abstract query graph).** The abstract query graph \\\\( G = (V, E, f, g) \\\\) is a directed graph with three node types, \\\\{Constant Entity, Existential Variable, Free Variable\\\\}, and two edge types, \\\\{positive, negative\\\\}.

However, to the best of our knowledge, there has not been a systematic evaluation protocol for EFO$_k$ queries, thus we leverage this idea and propose three types of different metrics to fill the research gap in the area of evaluation of queries with multiple free variables, and thus have combinatorial answers.\\n\\n**Marginal.** For any free variable $y_i$, its full answer is $A^{y_i} = \\\\{a_i \\\\in E | (a_1, \\\\cdots, a_i, \\\\cdots, a_k) \\\\in A\\\\}$, the observed answer of it $A^{y_i}_o$ is defined similarly. This is termed \u201csolution projection\u201d in CSP theory [12] to evaluate whether the locally retrieved answer can be extended to an answer for the whole problem. Then, we rank the hard answer $A^{y_i}_h = A^{y_i} - A^{y_i}_o$ against those non-answers $E - A^{y_i} - A^{y_i}_o$ and use the ranking to compute standard metrics like MRR, HIT@K for every free variable. Finally, the metric on the whole query graph is taken as the average of the metric on all free variables. We note that this metric is an extension of the previous design [20]. However, this metric has the inherent drawback that it fails to evaluate the combinatorial answer by the $k$-length tuple and thus fails to find the correspondence among free variables.\\n\\n**Multiply.** Because of the limitation of the marginal metric discussed above, we propose to evaluate the combinatorial answer by each $k$-length tuple $(a_1, \\\\cdots, a_k)$ in the hard answer set $A_h$. Specifically, we rank each $a_i$ in the corresponding node $y_i$ the same as the marginal metric. Then, we propose the HIT@$n^k$ metric, it is 1 if all $a_i$ is ranked in the top $n$ in the corresponding node $y_i$, and 0 otherwise.\\n\\n**Joint.** Finally, we note these metrics above are not the standard way of evaluation, which is based on a joint ranking for all the $E^k$ combinations of the entire search space. We propose to estimate the joint ranking in a closed form given certain assumptions, see Appendix E for the proof and details.\\n\\n## 5 The EFO$_k$-CQA dataset and benchmark results\\n\\n### 5.1 The EFO$_k$-CQA dataset\\n\\nWith the help of our framework developed in Section 4, we develop a new dataset called EFO$_k$-CQA, whose combinatorial space is parameterized by the number of constants, existential and free variables, and the number of edges. EFO$_k$-CQA dataset includes 741 different abstract query graphs in total.\\n\\n---\\n\\n4We note $A^{y_i}_h$ can be empty, making these marginal metrics not reliable, details in Appendix E.\"}"]}

This is an intriguing result that greatly deviates from traditional CSP theory which finds that the cyclic graph is NP-complete, while the acyclic graph is tractable \\\\cite{6}. We conjecture that the cyclic graph contains one more constraint than SDAG that serves as a source of information for CQA models, while the multigraph tightens an existing constraint and thus makes the query harder.\\n\\n**Model analysis.** For models that are built on operator tree, including BetaE, LogicE, and ConE, their relative performance is steady among all breakdowns and is consistent with their reported score in the original dataset \\\\cite{28}.

We expect future CQA models may use our framework to address this issue and gain better generalization.\\n\\nMoreover, by the detailed observation in Figure 4, we plot two boxes. In the red box, we find that even the worst model and the best model have pretty similar performance in these easiest queries despite that they may differ greatly in other queries. In the black box, we note that CQD [2], though designed in a rather general form, is pretty unstable when comes to empirical evaluation, as it has a clear downward curve and deviates from other model\u2019s performance enormously in most difficult query types. Therefore, though its performance is better than LMPNN on average as reported in Table 1, its unsteady performance suggests its inherent weakness, especially when the users are risk-sensitive and desire a trustworthy machine-learning model that does not crash in extreme cases [33].\\n\\nWe note FIT is designed to infer all EFO$_1$ queries and is indeed able to outperform other models in almost all breakdowns, however, its performance comes with the price of computational cost, and face challenges in cyclic graph where it degenerates to enumeration: we further explain in Appendix F.\\n\\n5.3 Benchmark results for $k = 2$\\n\\nAs we have explained in Section 4.5, we propose three kinds of metrics, marginal ones, multiply ones, and joint ones, from easy to hard, to evaluate the performance of a model in the scenario of multiple variables. The evaluation result is shown in Table 2. As the effect of the number of constant variables is quite clear, we remove it and add the metrics based on HIT@10 as the new factor.\\n\\nFor the impact regarding the number of existential variables and the topology property of the query graph, we find the result is similar to Table 1 which may be explained by the fact that those models are all initially designed to infer queries with one free variable. For the three metrics we have proposed, we have identified a clear difficulty difference among them though they generally show similar trends. The scores of joint HIT@10 are pretty low, indicating the great hardness of answering queries with multiple variables. Moreover, we have found that FIT falls behind other models in some breakdowns which are mostly cyclic graphs, corroborating our discussion in Section 5.2. We offer more experiment results and further discussion in Appendix H.\\n\\n6 Conclusion\\n\\nIn this paper, we make a thorough investigation of the family of EFO$_k$ formulas based on a strong theoretical background. We then present a new powerful framework that supports several functionalities essential to CQA task, and build the EFO$_k$-CQA dataset that greatly extends the previous datasets. Our evaluation result brings new empirical findings and reflects the biased selection in the previous dataset impairs the performance of CQA models, emphasizing the contribution of our work.\"}"]}

Meanwhile, learning-based methods enable faster neural approximate solutions of symbolic query answering problems [27].\\n\\nThe prevailing way is query embedding, where the computational results are embedded and computed in the low-dimensional embedding space. Specifically, the query embedding over the set operator trees is the earliest proposed [13]. The supported set operators include projection [13], intersection [26], union and negation [28], and later on be improved by various designs [40, 3]. Such methods assume queries can be converted into the recursive execution of set operations, which imposes additional assumptions on the solvable class of queries [36]. These assumptions introduce additional limitations of such query embeddings.\\n\\nRecent advancements in query embedding methods adapt query graph representation and graph neural networks, supporting atomics [21] and negated atomics [35]. Query embedding on graphs bypasses the assumptions for queries [36]. Meanwhile, other search-based inference methods [2, 39] are rooted in fuzzy calculus and not subject to the query assumptions [36].\\n\\nThough many efforts have been made, the datasets of complex query answering are usually subject to the assumptions by set operator query embeddings [36]. Many other datasets are proposed to enable queries with additional features, see [27] for a comprehensive survey of datasets. However, only one small dataset proposed by [39] introduced queries and answers beyond such assumptions [36]. It is questionable that this small dataset is fair enough to justify the advantages claimed in advancement methods [35, 39] that aim at complex query answering.

Then, $C = (C_1, \\\\cdots, C_t)$ is $t$-tuple constraint, each constraint $C_i$ is a pair of $(S_i, R_{S_i})$ where $S_i$ is called the scope of the constraint, meaning it is a set of variables $S_i = \\\\{x_{i,j}\\\\}$ and $R_{S_i}$ is the constraint over those variables [29], meaning that $R_{S_i}$ is a subset of the cartesian product of variables in $S_i$.\\n\\nThen the formulation of existential conjunctive formulas as CSP has already been discussed in Section 2.2. Additionally, for the negation of atomic formula $\\\\neg r(h, t)$, we note the constraint $C$ is also binary with $S_i = \\\\{h, t\\\\}$, $R_{S_i} = \\\\{(h, t)|h, t \\\\in \\\\mathcal{E}, (h, r, t) \\\\notin \\\\mathcal{KG}\\\\}$, this means that $R_{S_i}$ is a very large set, thus the constraint is less \u201cstrict\u201d than the positive ones.\\n\\nC Preliminary of tree form query\\n\\nWe explain the operator tree method, as well as the tree-form queries in this section, which is firstly introduced in [39]. The tree-form queries are defined to be the syntax closure of the operator tree method and are the prevailing query types in the existing datasets [28, 36], see the definition below:\\n\\n**Definition 17** (Tree-Form Query). The set of the Tree-Form queries is the smallest set $\\\\Phi$ such that:\\n\\n(i) If $\\\\phi(y) = r(a, y)$, where $a \\\\in \\\\mathcal{E}$, then $\\\\phi(y) \\\\in \\\\Phi$;\\n\\n(ii) If $\\\\phi(y) \\\\in \\\\Phi$, $\\\\neg \\\\phi(y) \\\\in \\\\Phi$;\\n\\n(iii) If $\\\\phi(y), \\\\psi(y) \\\\in \\\\Phi$, then $(\\\\phi \\\\land \\\\psi)(y) \\\\in \\\\Phi$ and $(\\\\phi \\\\lor \\\\psi)(y) \\\\in \\\\Phi$;\\n\\n(iv) If $\\\\phi(y) \\\\in \\\\Phi$ and $y'$ is any variable, then $\\\\psi(y') = \\\\exists y.r(y, y') \\\\land \\\\phi(y) \\\\in \\\\Phi$.\\n\\nWe note that the family of tree-form queries deviates from the targeted EFO$_1$ query family [39]. The rationale of the definition is that the previous model relied on the representation of \u201coperator tree\u201d which addresses logical queries to simulate logical reasoning as the execution of set operators [28, 40, 38], where each node represents a set of entities corresponding to the answer set of a sub-query [39]. Then, logical connectives are transformed into operator nodes for set projections (Definition 17 i, iv), complement (Definition 17 ii), intersection, and union (Definition 17 iii) [36]. Particularly, the set projections are derived from the Skolemization of predicates [24]. Therefore, the operator tree method that has been adopted in lines of research [28, 40, 38] is just a model that neuralizes these set operations: projection, complement, intersection, and union. These different models basically only differ from each other by their parameterization while having the same expressiveness as characterized by the tree form query.\\n\\nSpecifically, the left side of the Figure 1 shows an example of the operator tree, where \u201cHeld\u201d and \u201cLocated\u201d are treated as two projections, \u201cN\u201d represents set complement, and \u201cI\u201d represents set intersection. Therefore, the embedding of the root representing the answer set can be computed based on these set operations in a bottom-up manner [28].\\n\\nFinally, it has been noticed that tree-form query is subject to structural traceability and only has polynomial time combined complexity for inference while the general EFO$_k$, or even EFO$_1$ queries, is NP-complete, with detailed proof in [39]. Therefore, this result highlights the importance of investigating the EFO$_k$ queries as it greatly extends the previous tree-form queries.\\n\\nD Construction of the whole EFO$_k$-CQA datset\\n\\nIn this section, we provide details for the construction of the EFO$_k$-CQA dataset.\\n\\nD.1 Enumeration of the abstract query graphs\\n\\nWe first give a proposition of the property of abstract query graph:\\n\\n**Proposition 18.** For an abstract query graph $G$, if it conforms Assumption 13 and Assumption 14 then removing all constant entities in $G$ will lead to only one connected component and no edge is connected between two constant entities.\"}"]}

If there is an edge (whether positive or negative) between constant entities, then this edge is redundant, violating Assumption 13. Then, if there is more than one connected component after removing all constant entities in $G$. Suppose one connected component has no free variable, then this part is a sentence and thus has a certain truth value, whether 0 or 1, which is redundant, violating Assumption 13. Then, we assume every connected component has at least one free variable, we assume there is $m$ connected component and we have:\\n\\n$$\\\\text{Node}(G) = (\\\\cup_{i=1}^{m} \\\\text{Node}(G_i)) \\\\cup \\\\text{Node}(G_c)$$\\n\\nwhere $m > 1$, the $G_c$ is the set of constant entities and each $G_i$ is the connected component, we use $\\\\text{Node}(G)$ to denote the node set for a graph $G$. Then this equation describes the partition of the node set of the original $G$.\\n\\nThen, we construct $G_a = G[\\\\text{Node}(G_1) \\\\cup G_c]$ and $G_b = G[(\\\\cup_{i=1}^{m} \\\\text{Node}(G_i)) \\\\cup \\\\text{Node}(G_c)]$, where $G$ represents the induced graph. Then we naturally have that $\\\\mathcal{A}[I(G)] = \\\\mathcal{A}[I(G_a)] \\\\times \\\\mathcal{A}[I(G_b)]$, where the $\\\\times$ represents the Cartesian product, violating Assumption 14.\\n\\nAdditionally, as mentioned in Appendix B, the negative constraint is less \u201cstrict\u201d, we formally put an additional assumption of the real knowledge graph as the following:\\n\\n**Assumption 19.** For any knowledge graph $KG$, with its entity set $E$ and relations set $R$, we assume it is somewhat sparse with regard to each relation, meaning: for any $r \\\\in R$, $|\\\\{a \\\\in E | \\\\exists b. (a, r, b) \\\\in KG \\\\text{ or } (b, r, a) \\\\in KG\\\\}| \\\\ll |E|$.\\n\\nThen we develop another proposition for the abstract query graph:\\n\\n**Proposition 20.** With the knowledge graph conforming Assumption 19, for any node $u$ in the abstract query graph $G$, if $u$ is an existential variable or free variable, then it can not only connect with negative edges.\\n\\nProof. Suppose $u$ only connects to $m$ negative edge $e_1, \\\\cdots, e_m$. For any grounding $I$, we assume $I(e_i) = r_i \\\\in R$. For each $r_i$, we construct its endpoint set\\n\\n$$\\\\text{Endpoint}(r_i) = \\\\{a \\\\in E | \\\\exists b. (a, r, b) \\\\in KG \\\\text{ or } (b, r, a) \\\\in KG\\\\}$$\\n\\nby the assumption 19 we have $|\\\\text{Endpoint}(r_i)| \\\\ll |E|$, then we have:\\n\\n$$|\\\\cup_{i=1}^{m} \\\\text{Endpoint}(r_i)| \\\\ll \\\\sum_{i=1}^{m} |\\\\text{Endpoint}(r_i)| \\\\ll |E|$$\\n\\nsince $m$ is small due to the size of the abstract query graph. Then we have two situations about the type of node $u$:\\n\\n1. **If node $u$ is an existential variable.**\\n\\nThen we construct a subgraph $G_s$ be the induced subgraph of $\\\\text{Node}(G) - u$, then for any possible grounding $I$, we prove that $\\\\mathcal{A}[I(G_s)] = \\\\mathcal{A}[I(G)]$, the right is clearly a subset of the left due to it\"}"]}

Obviously, the abstract query graph that conforms to \u201cbounded negation\u201d will also conform to the requirement in Proposition 20. A vivid example is offered in Figure 2.\\n\\nFinally, we make the assumption of the distance to the free variable of the query graph:\\n\\n**Assumption 21.** There is a constant \\\\( d \\\\), such that for every node \\\\( u \\\\) in the abstract query graph \\\\( \\\\mathcal{G} \\\\), it can find a free variable in its \\\\( d \\\\)-hop neighbor.\\n\\nWe have this assumption to exclude the extremely long-path queries.\\n\\nEquipped with the propositions and assumptions above, we explore the combinatorial space of the abstract query graph given certain hyperparameters, including: the max number of free variables, max number of existential variables, max number of constant entities, max number of all nodes, max number of all edges, max number of edges surpassing the number of nodes, max number of negative edge, max distance to the free variable. In practice, these numbers are set to be: 2, 2, 3, 6, 6, 0, 1, 3. We note that the max number of edges surpassing the number of nodes is set to 0, which means that the query graph can at most have one more edge than a simple tree, thus, we exclude those query graphs that are both cyclic graphs and multigraphs, making our categorization and discussion in the experiments in Section 5.2 and Section 5.3 much more straightforward and clear.\\n\\nThen, we create the abstract query graph by the following steps, which is a graph with three types of nodes and two kinds of edges:\\n\\n1. First, create a simple connected graph \\\\( \\\\mathcal{G}_1 \\\\) with two types of nodes, the existential variable and the free variable, and one type of edge, the positive edge.\\n2. We add additional edges to the simple graph \\\\( \\\\mathcal{G}_1 \\\\) and make it a multigraph \\\\( \\\\mathcal{G}_2 \\\\).\\n3. Then, the constant variable is added to the graph \\\\( \\\\mathcal{G}_2 \\\\), In this step, we make sure not too long existential leaves. The result is graph \\\\( \\\\mathcal{G}_3 \\\\).\\n4. Finally, random edges in \\\\( \\\\mathcal{G}_3 \\\\) are replaced by the negation edge, and we get the final abstract query graph \\\\( \\\\mathcal{G}_4 \\\\).\\n\\nIn this way, all possible query graphs within a certain combinatorial space are enumerated, and finally, we filter duplicated graphs with the help of the graph isomorphism algorithm. We give an example to illustrate the four-step construction of an abstract query graph in Figure 5.\\n\\n### D.2 Ground abstract query graph with meaningful negation\\n\\nTo fulfill the Assumption 15 as discussed in Section 4.2, for an abstract query graph \\\\( \\\\mathcal{G} = (V, E, f, g) \\\\), we have two steps: (1). Sample grounding for the positive subgraph \\\\( \\\\mathcal{G}_p \\\\) and compute its answer (2). Ground the \\\\( \\\\mathcal{G}_n \\\\) to decrease the answer got in the first step. Then we define positive subgraph \\\\( \\\\mathcal{G}_p \\\\) to be defined as such, its edge set \\\\( E' = \\\\{ e \\\\in E | g(e) = \\\\text{positive} \\\\} \\\\), its node set \\\\( V' = \\\\{ u | u \\\\in V, \\\\exists e \\\\in \\\\)\"}"]}

Then, in Algorithm 1 we implement each set operation in the operator tree, including intersection, negation, and set projection.

In our implementation, we further restrict FIT to at most enumerate 10 possible candidates for each node in the query graph, this practice has allowed FIT to be implemented in the dataset FB15k-237 [32]. However, it cost 20 hours to evaluate FIT on our EFO_k-CQA dataset while other models only need no more than two hours. Moreover, for larger knowledge graph, including NELL [7] and FB15k [5], we have also encountered an out-of-memory error in a Tesla V100 GPU with 32G memory when implementing FIT, thus, we omit its result in these two knowledge graphs.\\n\\nG Extension to more complex query answering\\n\\nIn this section, we discuss possible further development in the task of complex query answering and how our work, especially our framework proposed in Section 4 can help with future development. We list some new features that may be of interest and show the maximum versatility our framework can reach. Our analysis and characterization of future queries inherit the outlook in [37] and also is based on the current development.\\n\\n**Inductive Reasoning** Inductive reasoning is a new trend in the field of complex query answering. Some entities [9] or even relations [15] are not seen in the training period, namely they can not be found by the observed knowledge graph $G_o$ therefore, the inductive generalization is essential for the model to infer answers. We note that our framework is powerful enough to sample inductive queries with the observed knowledge graph $G_o$ given. Therefore, the functionality of sampling inductive query is easily contained and implemented in our framework, see [https://github.com/HKUST-KnowComp/EFOk-CQA](https://github.com/HKUST-KnowComp/EFOk-CQA). We note there we have already provided our EFO_k-CQA dataset in this setting as discussed in Appendix D.4.\\n\\n**N-ary relation** N-ary relation is a relation that has $n > 2$ corresponding entities, therefore, the factual information in the knowledge graph is not a triple but a $(n + 1)$-tuple. Moreover, the query graph is also a hypergraph, making the corresponding CSP problem even harder. This is a newly introduced topic [23, 1] in complex query answering, which our framework has limitations in representing.\\n\\n**Knowledge graph with attribute** Currently, there has been some research that has taken the additional attribute of the knowledge graph into account. Typical attributes include entity types [14], numerical literals [4], triple timestamps [16, 30], and triple probabilities [7]. We note that attributes expand the entity set $E$ from all entities to entities with attribute values, it is also possible that the relation set $R$ is also extended to contain corresponding relations, like \u201cgreater\u201d, \u201cless\u201d when dealing with numerical literals. Then, our framework can represent queries on such extended knowledge graphs like in [4], where no function like \u201cplus\u201d, or \u201cminus\u201d is considered and the predicates are also binary.\\n\\nOverall, our framework can be applied to some avant-garde problem settings given certain properties, thus those functionalities proposed in Section 4 can be useful. We hope our discussion helps with the future development of complex query answering.\"}"]}

For the purpose of supplementation, we select some representative experiment result as the experiment result is extremely complex to be categorized and be shown. We present the further benchmark result of the following: the analysis of benchmark result in detail, more than just the averaged score in Table 1 and Table 2, which is provided in Appendix H.1; result of different knowledge graphs, including NELL and FB15k, which is provided in Appendix H.2 and H.3; the situation of more constant entities since we only discuss when there are two constant entities in Table 2, the result is provided in Appendix H.4; and finally, all queries (including the queries without marginal hard answers), in Appendix H.5.\\n\\nWe note that we have explained in Section 4.5 and Appendix E that for a query with multiple free variables, some or all of the free variables may not have their marginal hard answer and thus the marginal metric can not be computed. Therefore, in the result shown in Table 2 in Section 5.3 we only conduct evaluation on those queries that both of their free variables have marginal hard answers, and we offer the benchmark result of all queries in Appendix H.5 where only two kinds of metrics are available.\\n\\nH.1 Further result and analysis of the experiment in main paper\\n\\nTo supplement the experiment result already shown in Section 5.2 and Section 5.3, we have included more benchmark results in this section. Though the averaged score is a broadly-used statistic to benchmark the model performance on our EFO_k queries, this is not enough and we have offered much more detail in this section.\\n\\nWhole combinatorial space helps to develop trustworthy machine learning models. Firstly, we show more detailed benchmark results of the relative performance between our selected six CQA models, the result is shown in Table 4. Specifically, we plot two boxes, the black one, including the most difficult query types, and the red box, including the easiest query types. In the easiest part, we find that even the worst model and the best model have pretty similar performance despite that they\"}"]}

The performance in the most difficult query types is more important when the users are risk-sensitive and desire a trustworthy machine-learning model that does not crash in extreme cases [33] and we highlight it in the black box. In the black box, we note that CQD [2], though designed in a rather general form, is pretty unstable when comes to empirical evaluation, as it has a clear downward curve and deviates from other model\u2019s performance enormously in the most difficult query types. Therefore, though its performance is better than LMPNN and comparable to BetaE on average as reported in Table 1, its unsteady performance suggests its inherent weakness. On the other hand, ConE [40] is much more steady and outperforms BetaE and LogicE consistently. We also show the result when there are two free variables in Figure 7, where the model performance is much less steady but the trend is similar to the EFO1 case in general.\\n\\n**Empirical hardness of query types and incomplete discussion of the previous dataset.** Moreover, we also discuss the empirical hardness of query types themselves and compare different datasets accordingly in Figure 8. We find the standard deviation of the six representative CQA models increases in the most difficult part and decreases in the easiest part, corroborating our discussion in the first paragraph. We also highlight those query types that have already been investigated in BetaE dataset [28] and FIT dataset [39]. We intuitively find that the BetaE dataset does not include very challenging query types while the FIT dataset mainly focuses on them. This can be explained by the fact that nine out of ten most challenging query types correspond to multigraph, which the BetaE dataset totally ignores while the FIT dataset highlights it as a key feature. To give a quantitative analysis of whether their hand-crafted query types are sampled from the whole combinatorial space, we have adopted the Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test to test the distribution discrepancy between their distribution and the query type distribution in EFO\\\\(_k\\\\)-CQA since EFO\\\\(_k\\\\)-CQA enumerates all possible query types in the given combinatorial space and is thus unbiased. We find that the BetaE dataset is indeed generally easier and its p-value is 0.78, meaning that it has a 78 percent possibility to be unbiased, while the FIT dataset is significantly harder and its p-value is 0.27. Therefore, there is\"}"]}

This paper mainly focuses on extending the scope of the complex query given the same knowledge graph and also presents systematic benchmarks and convenient implementation for the whole pipeline of complex query answering, which holds the potential to significantly advance the development of complex query answering models.\\n\\nThe outcomes of this work have practical applications, particularly in areas such as fraud detection, where queries involving multiple free variables and cyclic patterns are necessary. Furthermore, since this study utilizes publicly available knowledge graphs without incorporating new information sources, concerns regarding data leakage are unlikely to arise. However, it\u2019s still important to note that this work may lead to unexpected negative societal impact which we are unable to foresee in the current stages. We recognize the necessity of ongoing evaluation and responsible oversight to identify and address any unintended consequences that may arise as a result of this research.\\n\\nAdditionally, the figure of the real-world KG in Figure 3 is taken from [https://medium.com/@fakrami/re-evaluation-of-knowledge-graph-completion-methods-7dfe2e981a77](https://medium.com/@fakrami/re-evaluation-of-knowledge-graph-completion-methods-7dfe2e981a77).\"}"]}
