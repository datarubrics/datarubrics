Yet, forecasting beyond the weather timescale is challenging because it deals with problems other than initial condition, including boundary interaction, butterfly effect, and our inherent lack of physical understanding. At present, existing benchmarks tend to have shorter forecasting range of up-to 15 days, do not include a wide range of operational baselines, and lack physics-based constraints for explainability. Thus, we propose ChaosBench, a challenging benchmark to extend the predictability range of data-driven weather emulators to S2S timescale. First, ChaosBench is comprised of variables beyond the typical surface-atmospheric ERA5 to also include ocean, ice, and land reanalysis products that span over 45 years to allow for full Earth system emulation that respects boundary conditions. We also propose physics-based, in addition to deterministic and probabilistic metrics, to ensure a physically-consistent ensemble that accounts for butterfly effect. Furthermore, we evaluate on a diverse set of physics-based forecasts from four national weather agencies as baselines to our data-driven counterpart such as ViT/ClimaX, PanguWeather, GraphCast, and FourCastNetV2. Overall, we find methods originally developed for weather-scale applications fail on S2S task: their performance simply collapse to an unskilled climatology. Nonetheless, we outline and demonstrate several strategies that can extend the predictability range of existing weather emulators, including the use of ensembles, robust control of error propagation, and the use of physics-informed models. Our benchmark, datasets, and instructions are available at https://leap-stc.github.io/ChaosBench.\\n\\n1 Introduction\\n\\nAlthough critical for economic planning, disaster preparedness, and policy-making, subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) prediction is lagging behind the more established field of short/medium-range weather, or long-range climate predictions. For instance, many natural hazards tend to manifest in the S2S scale, including the slow-onset of droughts that lead to wildfire \\\\cite{1,2}, heavy precipitations that lead to flooding \\\\cite{3}, and persistent weather anomalies that lead to extremes \\\\cite{4}. So far, current approaches to weather and climate prediction are heavily reliant on physics-based models in the form of Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP). Many NWPs are based on the discretization of governing equations that describe thermodynamics, fluid flows, \\\\textit{etc}. However, these models are expensive to run especially in high-resolution setting. For example, there are massive computational overheads to perform numerical integration at fine spatiotemporal resolutions that are operationally useful \\\\cite{5}. Furthermore,\"}"]}

It is framed as a high-dimensional sequential regression task that consists of 45+ years, multi-system observations for validating physics-based and data-driven models, and training the latter. Physics-based forecasts are generated from four national weather agencies with 44-day lead-time and serve as baselines to data-driven forecasts. Our benchmark is one of the first to incorporate physics-based metrics to ensure physically-consistent and explainable models. The blurred image at $\\\\Delta t = 44$ represents a challenge of long-term forecasting.\\n\\ntheir relative inaccessibility to non-experts is a major roadblock to the broader community. As a result, there is a growing interest to apply data-driven models to emulate NWPs, as they tend to have faster inference speed, are less resource-hungry, and more accessible [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]. Nevertheless, many data-driven benchmarks have so far been focused on the short (1-5 days), medium (5-15 days), and long (years-decades) forecasting ranges. In this work, we include S2S as a more challenging task that requires different emulation strategies: being in between two extremes, it is doubly sensitive to (1) initial conditions (IC) as in the case for short/medium-range weather, and (2) boundary conditions (BC) as in the case for long-range climate [13, 14, 15, 16].\\n\\nWe propose ChaosBench to bridge these gaps (Figure 1). It is comprised of variables beyond the typical surface-atmospheric ERA5 to also include ocean, ice, and land reanalysis products that span over 45 years to allow for full Earth system emulation that respects boundary processes. We also provide 44-day ahead physics-based control (deterministic) and perturbed (ensemble) forecasts from four national weather agencies over the last 8 years as baselines. In addition, we introduce physics-based and incorporate probabilistic, in addition to deterministic metrics, for a more physically-consistent ensemble that accounts for butterfly effect. As far as we know, ChaosBench is one of the first to systematically evaluate several state-of-the-art data-driven models including ViT/ClimaX [17], PanguWeather [18], GraphCast [7], and FourCastNetV2 [9] on S2S predictability.\\n\\nIn this work, we demonstrate that existing physics-based and data-driven models are indistinguishable from unskilled climatology as the forecasting range approaches the S2S timescale. The high spectral divergence observed in many state-of-the-art models suggests the lost of predictive accuracy of multi-scale structures. This leads to significant blurring and a tendency towards smoother predictions. For one, such averaging is of little use when one attempts to identify extreme events requiring high-fidelity forecasts on the S2S scale (e.g., regional droughts, hurricanes, etc). Also, performing comparably worse than climatology renders them operationally unusable. This highlights the urgent need for a robust and unified data-driven S2S intercomparison project.\\n\\n2 Related Work\\n\\nIn recent years, several benchmarks have been introduced to push the field of data-driven weather and climate prediction [19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27]. We analyze the limitations of existing works, and propose how ChaosBench fills in these gaps (see Table 1 more justifications in Appendix C).\\n\\n**Gap in forecast lead-time.** Many existing benchmarks are built for short/medium-range weather (up to 15 days) [22, 19, 20], and long-term climate (annual to decadal scale) [26]. As discussed earlier, these problems tend to be easier due to the lack of combined sensitivities to IC and BC [13, 14].\\n\\n**Limited spatiotemporal extent.** Many S2S benchmarks tend to focus on regional forecasts, such as the US [23, 24]. In addition, the temporal extent of observation with common interval is more varied,\"}"]}

A similar phenomenon of skill collapse is evident in data-driven models, as depicted in Figure 5 (+ S3). Unlike their physics-based counterparts, these forecasts exhibit significantly higher spectral divergence as evidenced in Figure 6, indicating low predictive skill for multi-scale structures over long rollouts. This leads to the blurring artifacts previously discussed. The pervasive lack of predictive skill underscores the notoriously difficult challenge of S2S forecasting and highlights huge potential for improvement.\"}"]}

Note: $n$ represents the number of ensemble members.\\n\\n**Ensemble Forecasts Account for IC Uncertainty.** Despite the underperformance of deterministic models, many studies have highlighted the potential of ensemble forecasts to account for trajectory divergences caused by IC uncertainties [44, 45, 46], also known as the butterfly effect [15]. Figure S4 shows that the performance of ensembles across physics-based models improves relative to their deterministic counterparts. For instance, when we take the metrics ratio between ensemble and deterministic forecasts as in Figure 7 (+ S5), the ratio of RMSE decreases with lead time, while the ratio of MS-SSIM improves over time with little significant changes in SpecDiv. The extent of improvement also appears to be affected by the number of ensemble members i.e., higher ensemble size $n$ appears to improve skillfulness. We also note similar insights from data-driven ensembling strategy as discussed in Section G.3. This highlights the importance of building a well-dispersed ensemble that accounts for long-range divergences for improved S2S predictability.\\n\\n**Minimizing Error Propagation Promotes Stability.** Different training and inference strategies have been proposed to improve the accuracy and stability of data-driven weather emulators. Chief among these are the autoregressive and direct approaches [47]. The former iteratively cycles through small interval to reach the target lead-time i.e., $\\\\Delta t = N \\\\delta t$ where $N \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z}^+$ is the number of such compositions, while the latter directly outputs $\\\\Delta t$. As summarized in Table 2, we find models trained directly (e.g., ViT/ClimaX) have better performance than those used autoregressively (e.g., PW, GC, FCN2). This suggests that error propagation is a significant source of error, and controlling for stability is key to extend the predictability range of weather emulators. Once stability is achieved, the remaining sources of errors including uncertainties in observation and/or modeling framework can be improved through more data, better model, or both through data assimilation for instance [48].\\n\\n**Physical Constraints Yield Improved Performance.** We find models that explicitly incorporate physical knowledge (e.g., learning spectral signals beyond pixel information) have better performance across metrics, such as FNO, as summarized in Table S8 given identical parameter budget of $10^6$. This phenomena is unsurprising and has been repeatedly demonstrated in many real-world applications of physics-informed deep learning, for instance.\"}"]}

As illustrated in Figure 8 (+ S6), we find that ECMWF high-resolution ensemble, dubbed as the gold standard, still has the best performance in terms of CRPSS (vs ERA5 climatology), with a predictability range of around 15-20 days ahead before its skill collapses to climatology (i.e., CRPSS \u2192 0). However, the resurgence of data-driven models are rapidly transforming the field as they are able to efficiently distil knowledge and automatically discover emergent patterns from large-scale, high-dimensional dataset, instead of first reducing them to physical functions with limited set of variables requiring constant calibration as is traditionally done in NWPs. The challenge, therefore, is to extend the predictability range of weather system as a representation of large-scale chaos, and we welcome the machine learning communities to take part in this open effort.\\n\\n### 6 Conclusion\\n\\nWe present ChaosBench, a challenging benchmark to extend the predictability range of weather emulators into the S2S timescale where many processes with significant socioeconomic repercussions tend to occur, including extreme events. In addition to providing diverse datasets beyond ERA5 for a full Earth system emulation, we also perform extensive benchmarking on state-of-the-art data-driven and physics-based models alike. Through various ablation, we systematically find that skillfulness can be extended by ensemble forecasting, controlling for exponential error growth, and incorporating physical knowledge in our modeling approaches.\\n\\n**Future Work.** Our input datasets have relatively coarse spatiotemporal resolution to match that of physics-based S2S forecasts. Nevertheless, we make the data processing pipeline open-source, allowing users to easily process inputs of the desired resolution (see Section B.4 for more details). We are planning for a multi-source reanalysis products (e.g., MERRA-2 [49]), leveraging diverse dataset strengths, such as the assimilation of different set of observations. As always, we welcome any contribution from the open-source community to solve this important yet understudied problem. And any comments, feedback, and/or future feature requests can be directed to the corresponding author or through the Github issue tracker at https://github.com/leap-stc/ChaosBench\\n\\n### Acknowledgments and Disclosure of Funding\\n\\nWe would like to thank Matthew Wilson, Tom Andersson, and Dale Durran for the insightful discussion during the earlier version of the manuscript.
