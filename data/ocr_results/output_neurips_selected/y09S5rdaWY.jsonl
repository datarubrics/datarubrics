These developments have ushered in a new era of end-to-end autonomous driving (E2E-AD) systems [4\u20138], which promise a scalable, data-driven approach to vehicle automation, opposed to traditional module-based perception [9\u201313],\\n\\nThis work was in part supported by by NSFC (92370201, 62222607) and Shanghai Municipal Science and Technology Major Project under Grant 2021SHZDZX0102.\"}"]}

Such systems are designed to be capable of learning from vast amounts of data, potentially transforming the landscape of vehicle intelligence.\\n\\nDespite these advancements, the evaluation methodologies for E2E-AD systems remain a critical bottleneck. One popular way is to conduct log-replay with the recorded expert trajectories in dataset like nuScenes [21], i.e., open-loop evaluation. These models [4, 22] usually predict the future locations of the ego vehicle with the raw sensor information as inputs. As for metrics, the L2 error relative to the recorded trajectories and the ratio of collision happening are used. However, as widely discussed in the community [23, 24, 19], these open-loop metrics are insufficient for showcasing proficiency in planning, due to issues including distribution shift [25], causal confusion [26, 27], etc. nuScenes is also problematic due to its small and imbalanced validation set (around 75% of the frames only require continuing to drive straight) [24]. As a result, only encoding the ego status (location, speed, etc) [23] could achieve similar L2 errors compared to complex methods with sensor inputs [4], which prompts a call for a closed-loop evaluation benchmark for E2E-AD.\\n\\nCARLA [28] is one of the most widely used simulator for closed-loop E2E-AD evaluation. Within its framework, benchmarks such as Town05Long and Longest6 have been established, featuring multiple routes that require AD systems to complete safely within specific time constraints. However, these benchmarks only assess basic skills such as lane following, making turns, collision avoidance, and traffic lights obeying [29, 30], failing to examine AD systems\u2019 driving ability under complicated and interactive traffic. The latest CARLA Leaderboard v2 introduces 39 challenging scenarios designed to evaluate the robustness of AD systems in more intricate situations. Nevertheless, the official routes for evaluation, ranging from 7 to 10 kilometers and filled with scenarios, present a formidable challenge, often too difficult to complete flawlessly, as shown in Fig. 2 (a). Consequently, with the driving score metric employing an exponential decay function, it becomes challenging to effectively compare different AD systems, as they tend to score very low. For instance, in the current Leaderboard v2\u00b9, participating methods score less than 10 points out of 100. Besides, existing methods usually collect data by themselves which makes algorithm-level fair comparison infeasible.\\n\\nTo address the aforementioned challenges in evaluating autonomous driving (AD) systems, it is essential to develop a new benchmark that fairly assesses their capabilities in a granular manner. To this end, we introduce Bench2Drive, a new benchmark designed to evaluate E2E-AD systems in a comprehensive, realistic, and fair closed-loop environment. Bench2Drive has an official training dataset collected by state-of-the-art expert model Think2Drive [31], comprising 2 million fully annotated frames, sourced from 13638 clips. It span a diverse array of 44 interactive scenarios such as cut-ins, overtakings, and detours under different weather conditions and towns, ranging from sunny days in bustling city centers to foggy conditions in quaint villages. The evaluation protocol includes 220 short routes, each only around 150 meters in length and containing a single specific scenario. In this way, the assessment of individual skills is isolated and thus allows for a detailed comparison of the AD systems\u2019 proficiency across 44 distinct skill sets. Moreover, the brevity of each route mitigates the impact of the exponential decay function on the driving score, facilitating a more accurate and meaningful comparison of performance across different systems.

We implement several classic baselines including TCP [5], ThinkTwice [30], DriveAdapter [27], UniAD [4], VAD [22], and AD-MLP [23] and evaluate them in the Bench2Drive. We confirm the fact that open-loop metrics like L2 error could not reflect the actual driving performance. For the classic closed-loop metric - Drive Score, we find that it lack details and its heavy punishment encourages over-conservative driving strategies while Bench2Drive offers a comprehensive understanding about capabilities of different methods.\\n\\n## 2 Related Work\\n\\n### 2.1 Planning Benchmarks\\n\\nBenchmarking in the field of autonomous driving has evolved from specialized datasets, such as KITTI [32] for perception and NGSIM/highD [33], BARK [34] for behavior prediction, to integrated forms like nuScenes [21], Argoverse [35], and Waymo [36], which facilitate the evaluation of various synergic system components. Recently, the assessment of planning capabilities for learning-based methods has become an area of interest [37\u201341]. In Table 1, we present a comparison of planning benchmarks. nuScenes [21], while offering open-loop metrics, has been critiqued for its inability to adequately evaluate planning proficiency due to the lack of closed-loop simulation [23, 24, 19]. Furthermore, it suffers from an imbalanced validation set, with a significant portion (75%) of scenarios only requiring straightforward driving, thus inadequately challenging the decision-making capabilities of AD systems in complex environments [24]. nuPlan [38] and Waymax [37] offer closed-loop evaluations but are limited to bounding box level assessments, excluding sensor simulation and, consequently, are not suitable for E2E-AD methods.

CARLA Leaderboard V2 [28] lacks expert demonstration data. As widely discussed in the community [42, 43], the lack of an official training set makes the comparisons of different methods in the system-level instead of the algorithm-level. Bench2Drive deal with these shortcomings by offering a large-scale, annotation-rich official training dataset alongside a multi-ability evaluation set. This enables a more granular and informative assessment of an AD system\u2019s driving capabilities, overcoming the limitations of existing benchmarks that rely on average scoring across all routes as their primary performance metric.\\n\\n### 2.2 End-to-End Autonomous Driving\\n\\nThe concept of E2E-AD could date back to 1980s [44]. Recently, the arise of neural network, especially Transformer [45], demonstrates the power of scaling laws, which rejuvenates the enthusiasm for E2E-AD [46\u201350]. However, they are either evaluated only in the open-loop way [51, 4, 22, 52] or in the relatively simple scenes like Town05Long/Longest6 [53, 54, 42, 55\u201360]. Bench2Drive offers a challenging and comprehensive arena to compare E2E-AD methods\u2019 ability.\\n\\n### 3 Bench2Drive\\n\\nBench2Drive consists of a large-scale fully annotated dataset collected in CARLA as the official training set, an evaluation toolkit for the granular driving skill assessment, and implementations of several state-of-the-art E2E-AD methods tailored for the training dataset and evaluation toolkit. All data, codes, and checkpoints are in GitHub and Huggingface under Apache License 2.0. We give details in the following section.\\n\\n#### 3.1 Data Collection Agent\\n\\nThe data collection agent (expert) is responsible for collecting the data so that student models could learn from the data. In the real world, this is usually done by human to drive around the city, like the curation of KITTI [32], nuScenes [21], Waymo [36], Argoverse [35]. However, it requires lots of human efforts. In simulation, there is a cheap substitute - teacher model. The teacher model would use information not available in the real world (termed privileged information), for example, ground-truth locations, states, and intentions of surrounding agents and ground-truth states of traffic lights, etc. As a result, people using CARLA either write rules [43, 61] or train a RL model [50, 31] to use the privileged information to drive in the simulation.\\n\\nIn this work, we use the world model based reinforcement learning teacher - Think2Drive [31] to navigate in CARLA and collect data, since **it is the only expert model which is able to solve all 44 scenarios during the construction of Bench2Drive**. Notably, after the release of Bench2Drive, the rule-based expert PDM-Lite [61]\u00b2 is open sourced and users could use it for customized demand.\\n\\n#### 3.2 Expert Dataset\\n\\nExisting E2E-AD methods evaluated in the closed-loop manner [5, 6, 56, 57] typically collect their own data using the CARLA simulator. However, as highlighted in [42, 43], the size and distributions\\n\\n\u00b2[https://github.com/autonomousvision/carla_garage/tree/leaderboard_2](https://github.com/autonomousvision/carla_garage/tree/leaderboard_2)\"}"]}

To address this, we have constructed a large-scale expert dataset with comprehensive annotations including 3D bounding boxes, depth, and semantic segmentation, sampled at 10 Hz, to serve as the official training set. As the information from expert could be an important guidance of student models [49, 27, 60], we also provide the expert model - Think2Drive\u2019s [31] value estimation and features. Fig. 3 gives an overview. To facilitate the re-implementation of existing E2E-AD methods of community, we adopt a sensor configuration similar to nuScenes [21]:\\n\\n- **1x LiDAR**: 64 channels, 85-meter range, 600,000 points per second\\n- **6x Camera**: Surround coverage, 900x1600 resolution, JPEG compression (quality-level 20)\\n- **5x Radar**: 100-meter range, 30\u00b0 horizontal and vertical FoV\\n- **1x IMU & GNSS**: Location, yaw, speed, acceleration, and angular velocity\\n- **1x BEV Camera**: Debugging, visualization, remote sensing\\n- **HD-Map**: Lanes, centerlines, topology, dynamic light states, trigger areas for lights and stop signs\\n\\nMoreover, to tackle the challenge posed by the long-tail distribution of data from both perception and behavior perspectives, a significant bottleneck in autonomous driving [62] (approximately 75% of the clips in nuScenes only involve the ego vehicle driving straight), we ensure the distribution of weather conditions, landscapes, and behaviors are as uniform as possible. We add more available locations for scenarios compared to the official routes of CARLA Leaderboard V2 as shown in Fig. 4, enhancing the data diversity. Further, we design 5 more scenarios beyond Leaderboard V2 to enhance behavior diversity as detailed in Appendix G. We give the distribution of scenarios and weathers and towns in Appendix B. As illustrated, Bench2Drive dataset is rich in both perception and behavior diversity.\\n\\nFor data partitioning, we segmented the driving process into short clips, each approximately 150 meters in length and containing a single specific scenario. This segmentation allows for the curriculum learning [63] of individual driving skills. To cater to different computational capabilities, we designed three data subsets: mini (10 clips for debugging and visualization), base (1,000 clips, comparable to nuScenes, suitable for 8xRTX3090 server), and full (10,000 clips for large-scale studies).\"}"]}

This approach offers a general overview of driving capabilities but fails to pinpoint specific strengths and weaknesses of different methods. Even worse, existing benchmarks in CARLA like Longest6 [6] and Leaderboard V2 [28] cover several kilometers, leading to high variance in the driving score metric. This variance arises because the infraction score penalizes errors through cumulative multiplication, which can significantly skew results. For instance, consider three test runs where each achieves 90% route completion, but the number of red lights run differs: 0, 1, and 2. The corresponding driving scores would be 90, 90 * 0.7 = 63, and 90 * 0.7 * 0.7 = 44.1, which causes a large standard deviation - 18.9 and thus makes comparison between methods unreliable.\\n\\nTo address these issues, we propose a more granular evaluation framework for all 44 scenarios by designing 5 distinct short routes (around 150 meters in length) per scenario, each featuring different weathers and towns, which result in a total of 220 routes. This approach allows people to assess AD systems\u2019 capabilities by isolated skills, leading to a more detailed analysis with reduced variance. Further, we summarize 5 advanced skills for urban driving: Merging, Overtaking, Give Way, Traffic Sign, Emergency Brake as in Table 2 and report the score of each skill. The decoupled design provides a clearer insight into which skills are effectively handled by the AD systems and which are not, fostering a more nuanced understanding of system performance.\\n\\nFormally, the evaluation set consists of 220 routes and each route defines a pair of source location \\\\((x_{src}, y_{src})\\\\) and destination location \\\\((x_{dst}, y_{dst})\\\\) in one specific town and weather. Given raw sensor inputs (cameras, LiDAR, IMU/GPS, etc) as well as the target waypoints, the ego vehicle should drive from source to the destination location. We design two metrics to evaluate the performance:\\n\\n- **Success Rate (SR)**: This metric measures the proportion of successfully completed routes within the allotted time and without traffic violations. A route is deemed successful if the ego vehicle reaches its destination without any rule infractions. The success rate is calculated as the ratio of successful routes to the total number of routes, as shown in Equ. 1 (left).\\n\\n- **Driving Score (DS)**: This metric follows CARLA [28] official metric as reference. It considers both route completion and penalty for infractions. Specifically, it averages the route completion\"}"]}

Please refer to Appendix F for details about infraction types and penalties scores.\\n\\nFurther, beyond the the goal achieving ability of algorithms, we propose the following two metrics to measure the efficiency and smoothness of driving trajectories:\\n\\n- **Efficiency**: The CARLA team has implemented a function to check whether the self-driving car\u2019s speed is too low. This is determined by comparing the vehicle\u2019s speed with nearby vehicle:\\n\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\text{Speed Percentage} = \\\\frac{\\\\text{Ego Vehicle\u2019s Speed}}{\\\\text{Average Speed of Nearby Vehicles}} \\\\quad (2)\\n\\\\]\\n\\nThis function calculates the speed percentage using the vehicle\u2019s speed and the average speed of nearby vehicles at current frame. CARLA Leaderboard sets four checkpoints per route and checks the ego vehicle\u2019s speed when the ego vehicle arrives a checkpoint. Specifically, if the vehicle is faster than nearby vehicles, the driving efficiency would be larger than 100\\\\%. The check results are included as a penalty in the final driving score. However, with only four checkpoints, the vehicle must cover 25\\\\% of the total route distance before reaching the next checkpoint. This leads to a high variance in the penalty values for low speeds, complicating the reflection of driving capabilities in the driving scores. To alleviate this, we increase the number of checkpoints to 20. Speed check is now performed every 5\\\\% of the total route length, and it is excluded from the driving score calculation. The final driving efficiency metric is defined as the average of the speed percentage over all checks.\\n\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\text{Driving Efficiency} = \\\\frac{\\\\sum_i \\\\text{Speed Percentage}_i}{\\\\text{Speed Check Times}} \\\\quad (3)\\n\\\\]\\n\\nIf the ego vehicle fails to pass the initial 5\\\\% checkpoint, this route is not included in the final driving efficiency metric calculation. To account for cases where abnormal speed spikes may occur (e.g., when the vehicle falls off the current map layer), speed percentage values exceeding 1000\\\\% are filtered out.\\n\\n- **Comfortness**: Comfortness is closely related to human experience and thus requires comparing autonomous driving policy with the behavior of numerous human driving experts to measure it. For this, we follow the popular benchmark nuPlan\u2019s [38] smoothness(also called comfort) protocol, which evaluates ego\u2019s minimum and maximum longitudinal accelerations, the maximum absolute values of lateral acceleration, yaw rate, yaw acceleration, the longitudinal component of jerk, and the maximum magnitude of the jerk vector. These variables are compared to thresholds with default values determined empirically from the examination of nuPlan\u2019s human expert trajectories. Comfortness is measured based on whether these values fall within the upper and lower bounds of the expert values.\\n\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\text{Frame Variable Smoothness (FVS)} = \\\\begin{cases} \\n\\\\text{True} & \\\\text{if lower bound} \\\\leq p_i \\\\leq \\\\text{upper bound}, \\\\\\\\\\n\\\\text{False} & \\\\text{otherwise}\\n\\\\end{cases} \\\\quad (4)\\n\\\\]\\n\\nwhere smoothness variables(vars) include: longitudinal acceleration - expert bound: [-4.05, 2.40], maximum absolute lateral acceleration - expert bound: [-4.89, 4.89], yaw rate - expert bound: [-0.95, 0.95], yaw acceleration - expert bound: [-1.93, 1.93], longitudinal component of jerk - expert bound: [-4.13, 4.13], maximum magnitude of jerk vector - expert bound:[-8.37, 8.37].\\n\\nA trajectory is deemed Smooth only if all smoothness variables meet the smoothness criteria.\\n\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\text{Trajectory Smoothness} = \\\\bigwedge_{i=0}^{\\\\text{total frames}} \\\\text{FVS}\\n\\\\]\"}"]}

Note that if the total frames of a trajectory are less than 20, the respective route is excluded from the smoothness assessment.\\n\\n4 Experiments\\n\\n4.1 Baselines & Datasets\\n\\nTo establish a starting point for the community, we have implemented several classic E2E-AD methods in Bench2Drive including:\\n\\n- **UniAD** [4] explicitly conducts perception and prediction and uses Transformer Query to transport information. Together with it, we also implement the commonly used BEVFormer [10] in Bench2Drive,\\n- **VAD** [22] also adopts Transformer Query yet with vectorized scene representation and thus improves efficiency.\\n- **AD-MLP** [23] simply feeds the ego vehicle\u2019s history states into an MLP to predict future trajectories, which is a simple baseline for history state interpolation planner.\\n- **TCP** [64] only uses the front cameras and the ego state as inputs to predict both trajectories and control signals. It is a simple yet effective baseline in CARLA v1.\\n- **ThinkTwice** [30] promotes the idea of coarse-to-fine by refining the planning routes in a layer-by-layer manner and distilling the expert features.\\n- **DriveAdapter** [27] proposes a new paradigm to fully unleash the power of expert model by decoupling the learning of perception and planning and connecting the two parts by adapter modules.\\n\\nRecognizing the varied computational resources available within the community, we have trained these baseline models on the base subset (1,000 clips). We use 950 clips for training while leaving 50 clips for open-loop evaluation. We ensure that the validation set contains at least one clip for each of 44 scenarios and the weather distribution is balanced. AD-MLP and TCP are trained with 1 * A6000 while ThinkTwice, DriveAdapter, UniAD, and VAD are trained with 8 * A100. For the closed-loop evaluation, we run all models in CARLA with the 220 test routes mentioned in Sec. 3.3 and calculate the metric accordingly. Note that some models\u2019 might have wrong behaviors in some certain routes (e.g., driving to some buggy location) and cause CARLA to crash without scoring. We treat these routes as 0 score. Please refer to Appendix C for more implementation details.\\n\\n4.2 Results\\n\\nIn Table 3 and Table 4, we compare baselines E2E-AD methods with both open-loop and closed-loop evaluation, which lead to the following findings:\\n\\n**Open-loop metric could indicate model convergence but it fails for advanced comparison.** AD-MLP has a high L2 error and performs extremely bad in closed-loop evaluation while VAD has a low L2 error and a decent closed-loop performance. *It shows that we could use L2 error to verify the*\"}"]}

In this case, AD-MLP does not use raw sensors, which is similar to drive blindly and thus infeasible to fit the dataset. Notably, different from findings in nuScenes [21], AD-MLP fails to achieve decent L2 error in Bench2Drive, due to the better behavior diversity as shown in Fig. 5. On the other hand, UniAD-base has a lower L2 error compared to VAD yet with worse closed-loop performance, aligning with findings in [19, 24]. Open-loop evaluation ignore the issues including distribution shift [25] and causal confusion [26, 27] and thus fails to give meaningful comparison for models with good fitting of dataset, demonstrating the importance of closed-loop evaluation. For efficiency and smoothness, we could observe that AD-MLP has the lowest efficiency due to its quick failure and stuck. UniAD has higher efficiency and smoother trajectories compared to TCP-traj, demonstrating the effectiveness of the UniAD\u2019s post optimization for the planning head.\\n\\n**Expert feature distillation offers important guidance.** As pointed out in [49, 50], due to the high-dimensional input space of AD, i.e., multiple images and point clouds, E2E-AD methods tend to overfit. The features from expert, which already possesses strong driving knowledge, could be helpful to mitigate the issue by distillation. As a result, methods (TCP/ThinkTwice/DriveAdapter) with expert feature distillation outperforms those without (VAD/UniAD) by a large margin. From the comparison between TCP-traj with and without distillation, we could observe similar trend. However, in the real world setting, it could be difficult to obtain expert features, which worths further study.\\n\\n**Interactive behaviors are difficult to learn.** All models\u2019 scores of skills regarding strong interaction (Merging, Overtaking, and Emergency Brake) are unsatisfying. It might come from two perspectives: (I) Long-tail issue. Even though we ensure that the number of clips for different scenarios are similar, there are only a few frames within one clip are about interactive behaviors. As a result, it might be challenging for the learning. (II) Imitation learning paradigm. Direct supervised training of control signals or trajectories might fail to give guidance regarding the gaming, thinking, and reasoning process of interaction. More advanced training paradigms could be a promising direction.\"}"]}

For all five abilities, we choose some representative scenarios to visualize, where some baselines success and some baselines fail for the ease of comparison and analysis. We give the corresponding failure analysis so that the users and practitioners could have a sense about the pros, cons, and future works of existing E2E-AD methods.\\n\\n### 5 Conclusion\\n\\nIn this work, we present Bench2Drive, a new benchmark tailed for closed-loop evaluation of end-to-end autonomous driving methods. We open source a fully-annotated large-scale dataset as the official training set and a multi-ability evaluation toolkit for the granular driving skill assessment. State-of-the-art E2E-AD methods are tested in Bench2Drive with their pros and cons evaluated, which provides insights for the future direction.\\n\\n**Limitations:** Since the rendering of simulation in CARLA has gaps compared to real world, utilizing real world datasets could be complementary as done in the concurrent work - NAVSIM [65]. Actually, there is a dilemma in the field for the evaluation of end-to-end autonomous driving algorithms:\\n\\n| Source of Images       | Pros       | Cons         |\\n|------------------------|------------|--------------|\\n| Real World Datasets    | Realistic  | Non-Reactive |\\n| Simulation Rendering   | Reactive   | Cartoon Style|\\n\\nGenerative models like diffusion models [66] might have the potential to provide realistic and reactive rendering, with some pioneering works in the field [67\u201369]. However, the illusion and artifact issue of diffusion requires further exploration.\\n\\n**Social Impact:** The deployment of AD systems holds immense potential to revolutionize transportation, but it also brings significant ethical and safety concerns. Bench2Drive could serve as a platform for rigorously validating the capabilities of AD systems in a controlled and simulated environment, helping to identify potential flaws before real-world deployment. One of the primary risks is the simulation-reality gap\u2014the difference between how an AD system performs in simulation versus in the real world. Simulations have the difficulties to fully replicate the complexities and unpredictability of real-world driving conditions. There is a risk that an AD system might perform well in simulation but fail in real-world scenarios due to unmodeled factors like rare edge cases, unexpected human behaviors, or varying environmental conditions. Bench2Drive is intended to complement, not replace, real-world testing, and it is crucial to emphasize that simulation is one part of a broader validation process that must include extensive on-road testing.\"}"]}

We give details below:\\n\\n**Route:** We use the expert model Think2Drive to run on the predefined route files and only keep those without infractions. We design a traversal algorithm over all maps to determine whether a scenario could be triggered, aiming to cover towns as much as possible. The balance of weather, towns, and scenarios are ensured by manually checking. The behaviors and rendering of CARLA sometimes could be buggy as shown in Fig. 7 and we manually filter those bad clips.\\n\\n**Annotations:** We utilize CARLA\u2019s official APIs to collect annotations. Notably, there are several bugs within the APIs: (I) All pedestrians\u2019 speed value are 0 from the API. We manually calculate their speed by differentiating during training of baseline methods. (II) The returned value of Speedometer and IMU could be None. We pad these values with 0 during training. (III) Some stop signs in CARLA are on the ground and thus there is no bounding box. To compensate this, We record all stop signs with rectangles to denote their trigger volume. (IV) Some static vehicles\u2019 rotation and location are wrong by API. Thus, we use the correct center and extent to obtain their 3D bounding boxes.\\n\\n**Object Class:** Considering different attributes of different objects, we categorize all objects into four main types and store them group by group: Vehicle, Traffic Sign, Traffic Light, and Pedestrian. Vehicles are further subdivided into static and dynamic vehicles. Static vehicles remain stationary throughout the entire scenario and are distinguished by a unique actor identifier obtained from \u201dstatic.prop.mesh\u201d. For Traffic Signs, they consist of speed_limit_sign, stop_sign, yield_sign, warning_sign (including warning construction, traffic warning, and warning accident), dirt_debris, and cone. Notably, signs involving trigger_volume, such as speed_limit_sign, stop_sign, and yield_sign, has trigger volume where we store the rectangle as well. The coordinates for warning signs and cones are obtained from the center and extent of their actor class, while dirt_debris requires additional conversion due to inaccurate coordinates. For Traffic Lights, the trigger volume coordinates for traffic signs and lights are relative to the actor, which requires extra transformation. Each traffic sign/light consists of two parts: the pole and the light/sign itself while the bounding boxes from API is only the lights/signs.\\n\\n**Coordinate System:** Unlike the Y-down right-hand system used by Nuscenes, CARLA employs the Unreal Engine coordinate system, which is a Z-up left-hand coordinate system. In Compass, orientation with regard to the North ([0.0, -1.0, 0.0] in Unreal Engine) means the standard yaw angle in the left-hand system is theta in the compass minus 1/2 pi. In rare cases, this may result in NaN values, which need to be manually filtered.\\n\\n**Map Information:** The HD-Map is organized into road_ids with lane_index. Each lane includes the world coordinates and orientations of points, lane type, color identifiers and adjacent road_ids-lane_ids (left, right and connected road ids and lane ids), as well as topological structures (e.g.,\"}"]}

Images are compressed using JPG with the quality= 20. To avoid train-val gap during closed-loop evaluation, we also use in-memory JPG compression and decompression during inference. Semantic segmentation and depth data are stored as PNG files. We use a specialized algorithm called laszip to compress our LiDAR point clouds. JSON files are compressed using GZIP.\\n\\n## B Distribution of Scenarios, Towns and Weathers\\n\\nAs shown in Fig. 8, the distribution of weathers are nearly uniform while the distribution of town is dominated by Town12 and Town13. The imbalance comes from two perspectives: (I) New towns, like Town12 and Town13, are designed on purpose by CARLA team to be much larger than old towns so that the community could explore applications in city-level scene. Thus, we collect more data in larger towns for more diverse landscapes. (II) Lots of new scenarios in Leaderboard v2 are designed recently and thus old towns do not support the layouts required by new scenarios. For example, parting exit requires the existence of other parked vehicles. As a result, we have to collect more data in new towns to ensure the balance of scenario types.\\n\\n## C Implementation Details of Baselines\\n\\nFor all baseline E2E-AD methods, we strictly follow their official open-sourced code, environments, and configs. There are a few modifications: (I) For methods with object detection module, we change the detection classes according to CARLA\u00b3. (II) Data collection of Bench2Drive is in 10Hz while nuScenes with bounding boxes is in 2Hz. Due to Bench2Drive\u2019s longer clips, Bench2Drive-base has approximately 10x frames compared to nuScenes yet with higher redundancy. For computationally demanding methods like UniAD/VAD/ThinkTwice/DriveAdapter, we train $\\\\frac{1}{10}$ epochs compared to the original version. We observe similar level of loss due to similar number of training steps. (III) Since ThinkTwice and DriveAdapter require expert\u2019s BEV features, we use Think2Drive expert to regenerate those expert feature. Additionally, for fair comparison with other methods, we modify both of them into 6 cameras without LiDAR.\\n\\n## D Training and Evaluation Resource Requirements\\n\\nWe report resource requirements of training and evaluating baselines. Note that the evaluation time could be linearly speed up with more GPUs to parallely evaluate on more routes.\\n\\n\u00b3[https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/catalogue_vehicles/](https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/catalogue_vehicles/)\"}"]}

Was there a specific task in mind? Was there a specific gap that needed to be filled? Please provide a description. We build the benchmark to fulfill the need of comprehensive and realistic testing environments for Full Self-Driving (FSD). The primary task is end-to-end autonomous driving. Existing benchmarks failed to provide a closed-loop granular assessment of driving skills for E2E-AD methods.\\n\\nWho created the dataset (e.g., which team, research group) and on behalf of which entity (e.g., company, institution, organization)? This dataset is curated by Xiaosong Jia, Zhenjie Yang, Qifeng Li, Zhiyuan Zhang, Junchi Yan from ReThinkLab with School of AI and Department of CSE, Shanghai Jiao Tong University.\\n\\nJ.2 Distribution\\n\\nWill the dataset be distributed to third parties outside of the entity (e.g., company, institution, organization) on behalf of which the dataset was created? Yes.\\n\\nHow will the dataset be distributed (e.g., tarball on website, API, GitHub)? All data, codes, and checkpoints are in GitHub (https://github.com/Thinklab-SJTU/Bench2Drive) and Huggingface (https://huggingface.co/datasets/rethinlab/Bench2Drive).\\n\\nJ.3 Maintenance\\n\\nWho will be supporting/hosting/maintaining the dataset? All authors and potentially new members of ReThinLab in Shanghai Jiao Tong University led by Prof. Junchi Yan.\\n\\nHow can the owner/curator/manager of the dataset be contacted (e.g., email address)?

No erratum as of submission.\\n\\nWill the dataset be updated (e.g., to correct labeling errors, add new instances, delete instances)? Yes, we will maintain the dataset.\\n\\nWill older versions of the dataset continue to be supported/hosted/maintained? Yes.\\n\\nIf others want to extend/augment/build on/contribute to the dataset, is there a mechanism for them to do so? Yes, they could follow the guide in https://github.com/Thinklab-SJTU/Bench2Drive.\\n\\nJ.4 Composition\\n\\nWhat do the instances that comprise the dataset represent? One basic instance is one clip. Each clip contains hundreds or thousands of frames in 10 Hz with raw sensor information and annotations.\\n\\nHow many instances are there in total (of each type, if appropriate)? There are 13638 clips in Bench2Drive.\\n\\nAre relationships between individual instances made explicit? Yes. Each clip is annotated with scenario types and locations. Clips could have the same scenario type or nearby location.\\n\\nAre there recommended data splits (e.g., training, development/validation, testing)? Yes. In the github repo.\\n\\nIs the dataset self-contained, or does it link to or otherwise rely on external resources? Self-contained.\\n\\nJ.5 Collection Process\\n\\nWho was involved in the data collection process (e.g., students, crowdworkers, contractors) and how were they compensated (e.g., how much were crowdworkers paid)? All data is collected in CARLA automatically The collection code is written by authors.\\n\\nJ.6 Use\\n\\nWhat (other) tasks could the dataset be used for? With existing annotations, the dataset could also be used to conduct 3D object detection, semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, point cloud segmentation, depth estimation, tracking, motion prediction.\"}"]}
