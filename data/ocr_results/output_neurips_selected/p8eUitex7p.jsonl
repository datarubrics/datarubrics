This is a challenging task, as it involves inferring 3D information from 2D signals and most importantly, generalizing to rigid objects from unseen categories. However, existing datasets with object-level 3D annotations are often limited by the number of categories or the quality of annotations. Models developed on these datasets become specialists for certain categories or domains, and fail to generalize. In this work, we present ImageNet3D, a large dataset for general-purpose object-level 3D understanding. ImageNet3D augments 200 categories from the ImageNet dataset with 2D bounding box, 3D pose, 3D location annotations, and image captions interleaved with 3D information. With the new annotations available in ImageNet3D, we could (i) analyze the object-level 3D awareness of visual foundation models, and (ii) study and develop general-purpose models that infer both 2D and 3D information for arbitrary rigid objects in natural images, and (iii) integrate unified 3D models with large language models for 3D-related reasoning. We consider two new tasks, probing of object-level 3D awareness and open vocabulary pose estimation, besides standard classification and pose estimation.

Subsequent works then focused on developing specialized models that excel at 3D tasks for the categories and domains considered in these datasets. While these specialized models are found useful for certain downstream applications, they fail easily when generalizing to novel categories.

(i) **A large number of categories and instances.** ImageNet3D presents 2D and 3D annotations for a large number of object instances from a wide range of common rigid object categories found in natural images, as opposed to previous datasets focusing on specific categories and domains (see Table 1). This allows us to train and evaluate large unified 3D models capable of inferring both 2D and 3D information for arbitrary rigid objects.

Our ImageNet3D largely extends the number of categories and instances, improves the annotation quality, and presents other crucial annotations such as cross-category 3D alignment and natural captions interleaved with 3D information. ImageNet3D allows us to develop unified 3D models for general-purpose 3D understanding and facilitates studies on new research problems, such as probing of object-level 3D awareness and open-vocabulary pose estimation.\\n\\n**Category-level pose estimation.** Our work is closely related to category-level pose estimation, where a model predicts 3D or 6D poses for arbitrary instances from certain rigid categories. Previous works have explored keypoint-based methods [31] and 3D compositional models [32, 33]. However, these approaches limited their scopes to a small number of categories, and as far as we know, there were no attempts to develop large unified models for all common rigid categories. We further consider open-vocabulary pose estimation where models generalize to similar but novel categories. This topic has also been discussed in recent parallel works [34, 35] but [35] was limited to synthetic data rendered with photorealistic CAD models.\\n\\n**3D awareness of visual foundation Models.** Recent work demonstrates the significant capabilities of large-scale pretrained vision models in 2D tasks [20, 36, 37, 38, 21], suggesting robust 2D representations. Beyond benchmarking the semantic and localization capabilities of visual backbones [39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44], Banani et al. [22] studied the 3D awareness of these 2D models using trainable probes and zero-shot inference methods. However, their exploration was limited to only two basic aspects of 3D understanding \u2013 single-view surface reconstruction and multi-view consistency \u2013 due to absence of large datasets with 3D annotations. We further analyze the 3D awareness of visual models and provide a more comprehensive understanding of their progress in learning about the 3D structure of the world, demonstrating the significance of our proposed ImageNet3D.\\n\\n## 3 ImageNet3D Dataset\\n\\nImageNet3D dataset aims to facilitate the evaluation and research of general-purpose object-level 3D understanding models. Besides 6D pose annotations for more than 86,000 objects from 200 categories, we annotate meta-classes, cross-category 3D alignment, and natural captions interleaved with 3D information as demonstrated in Figure 1. We start by presenting our dataset construction in Section 3.1. Then in Section 3.2 we introduce the necessity of cross-category 3D alignment and how it is achieved in our dataset. Lastly, we provide details on our image caption generation in Section 3.3.\\n\\n### 3.1 Dataset Construction\\n\\n**Overview.** We choose the ImageNet21k dataset [23] as our data source, as it provides a large and diverse set of images with class labels. We start by annotating 2D bounding boxes for the object instances in the images. We adopt a machine-assisted approach for 2D bounding box annotations, where a Grounding DINO model [45] is used to produce 2D bounding boxes prompted with the category label. The bounding box annotations are then filtered and improved by human evaluators. Next, we collect 3D CAD models as representative shapes for each object category from Objaverse [46].\"}"]}

Lastly we generate natural captions interleaved with 6D poses with GPT-4o. An overview of our data generation pipeline is visualized in Figure 2.\\n\\n**Object categories.** Our goal is to provide 3D annotations for all common rigid categories in real world. To achieve this, we carefully examine previous 2D and 3D datasets for image classification [23], object detection [47, 29, 28], and pose estimation [24, 27]. We choose the categories that are rigid, have well-defined shapes with certain variance, and have enough number of images available, which leads to the 200 categories in ImageNet3D. For detailed discussions on the choice of categories, please refer to Section A.1. Moreover, to leverage existing research in the field, we adopt the 100 categories and raw images from ObjectNet3D [24] and largely extend the number of categories and instances. As one of our goals is to improve the quality of 3D annotations, we only take unannotated images from ObjectNet3D, and all 3D annotations on these images are our original work. In Section D, we perform human evaluation on the annotation qualities in ObjectNet3D [24] and our ImageNet3D.\\n\\n**Annotator recruitment.** We recruit 30 annotators for data annotation. To improve the quality of the collected data, each annotator must complete an onboarding stage before starting. The onboarding stage includes training sessions where we present detailed instructions of various annotations and proper ways to handle boundary cases. Additionally, each annotator must annotate sample questions and meet the accuracy threshold to qualify for subsequent work. Please refer to Section A and Section C regarding our annotator guidelines, training sessions, and ethics statement.\\n\\n**Data collection.** We develop a web-based tool for data annotation so annotators can easily access the platform without local installation. A screenshot of our annotation tool is shown in Figure 5. For each object in ImageNet3D, the annotator needs to annotate the following. (i) **3D location and 3D viewpoint (i.e., 6D pose):** For more intuitive annotating, the 3D location is parameterized as a combination of 2D location and distance of the object. The 3D viewpoint is defined as the rotation of the object with respect to the canonical pose of the category, and represented by three rotation parameters, azimuth, elevation, and in-plane rotation (see Figure 6). (ii) **Density of the scene:** A binary label indicating if the scene is dense with many objects from the same category close to each other. (iii) **Visual quality of the object:** A categorical label with one of the four options: good, partially visible, barely visible, not visible. We refer the readers to Section C where we provide links to our annotation guidelines and instructions.\\n\\n### 3.2 Cross-Category 3D Alignment\\n\\nAs explained in Section 3.1, the 3D viewpoint of an object is defined as the rotation of the object with respect to the canonical pose of this category. However, in previous datasets such as ObjectNet3D [24], canonical poses from different categories are not necessarily \u201caligned\u201d. From the canonical poses depicted in Figure 4, the parts where the pencils \u201cwrite\u201d or the paintbrushes \u201cpaint\u201d are pointing to different directions, and the spouts of faucets and kettles are also mis-aligned.\\n\\nAs we scale up the number of categories in 3D-annotated datasets, having cross-category 3D alignment is a crucial design for the study of general-purpose object-level 3D understanding.\"}"]}

Specifically, we consider the following three rules. (i) **Semantic parts**: categories sharing similar semantic parts, such as wheels, push handles, or spouts, should be aligned. (ii) **Similar shapes**: categories sharing similar shapes, such as fans, Ferris wheels, and life buoys, should be aligned.

Previous approaches integrated segmentation or human pose modules with MLLMs [25, 26] and demonstrate strong multi-modal reasoning abilities.\\n\\nTo integrate general-purpose 3D understanding with existing MLLMs, we present image captions interleaved with 3D information.

Please refer to Section A.3 for details on caption generation as well as our GPT-4v prompts.\\n\\n4 Tasks\\n\\nWith the new data and annotations available in ImageNet3D, we hope to push forward the evaluation and research of general-purpose object-level 3D understanding. We consider two new tasks, probing of 3D object-level awareness 4.1 and open-vocabulary pose estimation 4.2, besides joint image classification and category-level pose estimation 4.3. We further other standard computer vision tasks, such as image classification and object detection, and report the full performance in our dataset page.\\n\\n4.1 Linear Probing of Object-Level 3D Awareness\\n\\nRecent developments of large-scale pretraining have yielded visual foundation models with strong capabilities. Self-supervised approaches such as MAE [49] and DINO [19] provide strong and generalizable feature representations that benefit downstream recognition and localization. When jointly trained with language supervision, CLIP features [20] demonstrate transferability to a wide range of multi-modal tasks. Moreover, foundation models for specific tasks, e.g., MiDaS [50] for depth estimation, also show impressive capabilities when applied to arbitrary images.\\n\\nAre these visual foundation models object-level 3D aware? Can these feature representations distinguish objects from different 3D viewpoints or retrieve objects from similar 3D viewpoints? A parallel work [22] found that certain foundation models have better 3D awareness despite trained without 3D supervision. However, they focused on low-level tasks such as depth estimation and part correspondence. It remains unclear if these visual foundation models are object-level 3D aware and produce 3D discriminative object representations.\\n\\nIn this task, we aim to evaluate the object-level 3D awareness of visual foundation models by linear probing the frozen feature representations on 3D viewpoint classification task. This is because models with superior object-level 3D awareness would produce 3D discriminative features that help to classify the viewpoints correctly. Compared to low-level tasks such as depth estimation and part correspondence, object-level 3D awareness is directly associated with high-level scene understanding that is crucial to downstream recognition and reasoning in robotics and visual question answering.\\n\\n**Task formulation.** We evaluate object-level 3D awareness by linear probing the frozen feature representations on 3D viewpoint classification task. Specifically, three linear classifiers are trained with respect to each of the three parameters encoding 3D viewpoint. To ensure that the neural features encode rich information about the target object with 3D annotations, we adopt a data pre-processing step where we crop and resize the image based on the 2D and 3D annotations (see Figure 7). Following the linear probing setting on ImageNet1k [51], we apply grid search to a range\"}"]}

These models fail easily when generalizing to novel categories that posses similar semantic parts with categories that the models are trained on. A recent study [34] investigated the open-vocabulary pose estimation problem from synthetic data rendered with photorealistic CAD models. However, the synthetic dataset demonstrates limited variations in both object appearances and image backgrounds, while our ImageNet3D provide 3D annotations on real images from a wide range of rigid categories to study this problem.\\n\\nHow can 3D models generalize to novel categories? Intuitively models may utilize semantic parts that are shared between novel categories and categories that are seen during training. As demonstrated in Figure 8, models may generalize 3D knowledge learned from cars (i.e., sedans and SUVs) to fire trucks based on the wheels and body of vehicles, or from hand barrows to shopping cars based on the push handles. Additionally, open-vocabulary pose estimation models may utilize large-scale 2D pre-training data or vision-language supervision and learn useful semantic information. For instance, after seeing 2D images of people riding a bicycle and a tricycle, models would learn to align the semantic parts and generalize from bicycles to tricycles. Lastly we provide detailed descriptions of object shape, part structure, and how humans interact with these objects for all categories in ImageNet3D (see Section A.1). Models may utilize such information and learn transferable features that generalize to novel rigid categories.\\n\\n**Task formulation.** We split the 200 categories in ImageNet to 63 common categories for training and 137 categories for open-vocabulary pose estimation. Models may utilize additional 2D data for pretraining but may be only trained on 3D annotations from the 63 common categories. During testing time, models have access to our annotated category-level captions besides the testing images. For complete lists of categories used for training and open-vocabulary pose estimation, please refer to Section C.\\n\\n**Evaluation.** Following standard pose estimation tasks [13, 24], we report **pose estimation accuracy** and median **pose error** (Eq. 1) on testing data from novel categories that are unseen during training.\\n\\n### 4.3 Joint Image Classification and Category-Level Pose Estimation\\n\\nFor joint image classification and category-level pose estimation, a model first classifies the object and then predicts the 3D viewpoint of the object. A prediction is only considered correct if both the predicted class label is correct and the pose error is within a given threshold.\\n\\nWhile this task has been studied in previous datasets [13, 24], ImageNet3D brings new challenges to existing models. Previous studies often focused on 12 or 20 categories [31, 32, 33] \u2013 how can we scale up these category-level 3D models to 200 categories while retaining a comparable performance? Moreover, with the meta classes and more categories available, we can better assess the limitations of current category-level pose estimation models.\\n\\n**Task formulation.** For each of the 200 categories, we split the samples into training and validation splits, each accounting for about 50% of the data. Based on the number of samples used for training, we can further evaluate models under zero-shot, few-shot, and fully supervised settings.\"}"]}

Results show that visual foundation models trained without 3D supervision demonstrates a reasonable level of object-level 3D awareness. Specifically, we find that DINO v2 largely outperforms other approaches in terms of object-level 3D awareness, followed by MAE, DINO, and MiDaS. However, the gap between these models are much smaller than the findings in [22]. Our ImageNet3D provides valuable assets to assess these visual foundation models from the perspective of object-level 3D awareness. In Section E.1 we present results on different metrics and study the scaling properties of self-supervised approaches on object-level 3D awareness.\\n\\n### 5.2 Open-Vocabulary Pose Estimation\\n\\n**Baselines.** Open-vocabulary pose estimation is a rather new topic, and there are no existing baselines designed specifically for this task.

Two types of approaches are considered: (i) **Classification-based methods** that formulate pose estimation as a classification problem.

(ii) **3D compositional models** learn neural mesh models with contrastive features and perform analysis-by-synthesis during inference.

However, generalization abilities of current 3D models are still quite limited when compared to models trained on annotations from novel categories.

However, we also note that there is a clear performance degradation as the number of categories scale up, as compared to results found in previous works [33]. We present the full results with other metrics and backbones and study the scaling properties of pose estimation models in Section E.3.\\n\\n### 6 Conclusion\\n\\nIn this paper we present ImageNet3D, a large dataset for general-purpose object-level 3D understanding. ImageNet3D largely extends the number of rigid categories and object instances, as compared to previous datasets with 3D annotations. Moreover, ImageNet3D improves the quality of 3D annotations by annotating cross-category 3D alignment, and provides new types of annotations, such as object visual qualities and image captions interleaved with 3D information that enable new research problems. We provide baseline results on standard 3D tasks, as well as novel tasks such as probing of object-level 3D awareness and open-vocabulary pose estimation. Experimental results show that with ImageNet3D, we can develop general-purpose models capable of inferring 3D information for a wide range of rigid categories. We also identify limitations of existing 3D models from our baseline experiments and discuss new problems and challenges for future studies.\\n\\n**Limitations.** As our image data are collected from ImageNet21k, most images are object-centric with only one or two instances. Thus our dataset may not be suitable for 3D object detection or tasks that require object co-occurrences. As far as we know, there are no existing 3D object detection datasets with 3D annotations for more than 20 categories. One reason is that annotating 6D poses for multiple categories is very time consuming, and category co-occurrences follow a long-tail distribution. On the other hand, previous studies [32, 33] have found that compositional models trained on object-centric data have the ability to generalize to real images with multiple objects or partial occlusion, which makes our ImageNet3D a competitive option when developing models for general-purpose object-level 3D understanding.\\n\\n### Acknowledgements\\n\\nAlan Yuille acknowledges support from the Army Research Laboratory W911NF2320008 and National Eye Institute (NEI) with Award ID: R01EY037193.

Our goal is to annotate most common rigid categories in natural images. We choose ImageNet21k as the source of our images as it includes a wide range of diverse images with object labels. Given the 21k categories in ImageNet21k, we choose the 200 categories based on the following criteria:\\n\\n1. **The category must be rigid.** Categories such as animals, clothes, or food are skipped as they are not suitable for category-level pose estimation.\\n\\n2. **The category must be a general class of objects, rather than a specific and limited subset of objects.** For instance, categories such as Gondola or speed boats are skipped as they are considered as subsets of boats.\\n\\n3. **The category must have well-defined shapes.** Categories such as chimes vary too much in shapes, making it hard to define common canonical poses for object pose estimation.\\n\\n4. **Objects from this category must vary in 3D viewpoints.** Images of oscilloscopes are often taken from the same viewpoint (i.e., front), making this category trivial for pose estimation.\\n\\nRemoving ambiguity in 3D viewpoint. Objects from certain categories have ambiguities in terms of 3D viewpoint. For instance, tables when looked from \u201cfront\u201d and \u201cback\u201d are visually indistinguishable. Certain datasets resolve this issue by annotating symmetry axes [35]. We follow [13, 24] and resolve the ambiguity by defining a \u201ccommon\u201d viewpoint. For instance, we assume tables are always looked at from the \u201cfront\u201d and bottles always have zero azimuth. Models would learn such biases from the training data and we could adopt the standard pose estimation metrics during evaluation.\\n\\nFor other information, please refer to our datasheet for dataset.\\n\\nA.2 Annotator Guidelines\\n\\nTo improve the quality of the 3D annotations, we provide detailed guidelines and tutorials to the annotators. These documents provide a detailed introduction to each parameter to be annotated, how to use the web app, and how boundary cases should be handled. We refer the readers to Section C.3 where we provide links to our annotator tutorials and guidelines.\\n\\nA.3 Caption Generation\\n\\nIn ImageNet3D we provide two types of captions, natural image captions interleaved with 3D information 3.3 and category-level captions that provide detailed descriptions of object shape, part structure, and how humans interact with these objects for all categories in ImageNet3D.\\n\\nNatural image captions interleaved with 3D information.

Specifically, we provide GPT-4v with our 3D annotations as context information and generate natural captions summarizing the objects in the images, as well\"}"]}

To generate captions interleaved with 3D information, we assign names (e.g., CAR1 and BICYCLE1) to each object in the images, which are fed into GPT-4v along with each object\u2019s bounding box. Once we obtain the captions from GPT-4v, we insert 3D annotations after the first mention of the objects names, i.e., from \u201cCAR1\u201d to \u201cCAR1 with <pose6d>\u201d.

We described potential risks to the annotators, such as being exposed to inappropriate images from the ImageNet21k dataset [23], and explained the purpose of the study and how the collected data will be used. All annotators are paid by a fair amount as required at our institution. Link to our IRB approval: drive.google.com.\\n\\n### B Implementation Details\\n\\n#### B.1 Baseline Models\\n\\n**Classification-based methods.** Classification-based methods formulate pose estimation as a classification problem. Three linear classifiers are added on top of feature backbones with respect to the three pose parameters. Continuous values from 0 to $2\\\\pi$ are projected into 40 bins, which are then learned with a cross-entropy loss by the classifier heads. All classification-based methods are trained on one A5000 GPUs for less than one day, depending on the backbone size.\\n\\n**3D compositional models.** For NOVUM [33], we simply follow the official implementation. For NMM-Sphere, we extend a neural mesh model with a unified sphere mesh shared by all categories. The NMM-Sphere model could be applied for joint classification and pose estimation with a class-contrastive loss, or be used for open-vocabulary pose estimation by learning category-agnostic features. All 3D compositional models are trained on eight A5000 GPUs for about two days.\\n\\n**LLaVA-pose.** Similar to [25, 26], we extend the LLaVA [6] model with a <pose> token, which is then decoded with a MLP (i.e., a classifier head) to predict the pose. The LLaVA-pose model is trained on eight A5000 GPUs for one day.\\n\\n#### B.2 Training Details\\n\\n**Data augmentations.** Our goal is to present baseline performance on ImageNet3D so we avoid complex data augmentations and leave it for future work to explore the benefits of data augmentation. For baseline models on all three tasks, we only adopt random horizontal flip.\\n\\n**Linear probing of object-level 3D awareness.** Following [51] we grid search learning rates, pooling strategies, and backbone blocks (where features are taken from) and report the validation accuracy achieved by the best set of parameters.\\n\\n**Open-vocabulary pose estimation.** For classification-based methods, models are trained for 120 epochs with a batch size of 64. We adopt the SGD classifier with an initial learning rate of 0.01.\\n\\n**Joint image classification and category-level pose estimation.** We adopt the same training strategy as in open-vocabulary pose estimation. Moreover, for weights balancing the classification loss and the pose estimation loss, we simply choose $w_1 = w_2 = 1.0$.\\n\\n#### B.3 Data Pre-processing for Linear Probing\\n\\nIn the linear probing of object-level 3D awareness experiments, we train linear classifiers on top of frozen feature representation from various visual foundation models. To ensure that the neural features encode rich information about the target object, we adopt a data pre-processing step where we crop and resize the image based on the 2D and 3D annotations.

Specifically, we present the annotated 6D poses from ObjectNet3D and ImageNet3D side by side to human evaluators. Then the human evaluator must choose which annotation is correct and visually better. The evaluation metrics include both the alignment of 3D viewpoint, as well as the 3D location of the object. We randomly shuffle the order the annotations presented to the annotators.\\n\\nWe collect human evaluation results from 16 categories that are both annotated in ImageNet3D and ObjectNet3D. 50 images are sampled from each category to compare the annotation quality. Results show that for all categories tested, annotations from ImageNet3D are generally favored than the annotations from ObjectNet3D, and on average, for 73.25% of the samples, annotations from ImageNet3D are favored. This demonstrate that 3D annotations from ImageNet3D tend to have a better quality than the annotations in ObjectNet3D. Detailed results are presented in Table 5.\\n\\nE Additional Experimental Results\\n\\nE.1 Linear Probing of Object-Level 3D Awareness\\n\\nWe report baseline performance using both $\\\\pi/6$ and $\\\\pi/18$ pose accuracies in Table 6. Moreover, we study the scaling properties of various baseline methods and visualize the results in Figure 10. Results show that DINO v2 and DeiT are not scaling well as model parameters increase, and MAE outperforms DINO v2 in large and huge model sizes.\"}"]}

Furthermore, we show in Figure 11 the scaling properties of ResNet and SwinTransformer on joint image classification and category-level pose estimation. Results show that SwinTransformer obtains better results when model sizes are comparable to ViT-B but ResNet outperforms Swin Transformer as the model sizes scale up.\\n\\nE.4 Ablation Study on Cross-Category 3D Alignment\\n\\nIn ImageNet3D we adopt cross-category 3D alignment by aligning the canonical poses for all object categories. This design resolves the ambiguity of canonical poses in novel object pose estimation. Moreover, we find that with cross-category 3D alignment, models can learn shared semantics between different categories, yielding a higher benchmark performance. Specifically we compare the benchmark performance before and after a random rotation (multiple of 90 degrees) is added to the canonical poses of about 1/3 of the object categories. We report the quantitative results in Table 9. The results highlight the benefits of joint training on cross-category aligned data when developing unified 3D vision models.\\n\\nNote that NMM-Sphere fails to converge well without cross-category 3D alignment. The reason is that misaligned canonical poses lead to false negative pairs and break the part contrastive learning. For instance, if \u201cshoe\u201d and \u201cslipper\u201d have misaligned canonical pose, then the shared semantic parts would form negative pairs in contrastive learning. Instead, shared semantic parts would form positive pairs and produce similar part embeddings when cross-category 3D alignment is adopted.\\n\\nE.5 Ablation Study on Training Time\\n\\nWe analyze the computational costs of training joint classification and pose estimation models on our ImageNet3D with 200 categories and on a subset of ImageNet3D with 100 categories (same categories as ObjectNet3D). We visualize the performance by wall clock time in Figure 12 of the attached PDF.\\n\\nResults show that for CNN or transformer models that formulate pose estimation as a classification problem (i.e., ResNet or SwinTransformer), they generally converge pretty fast and take a similar amount of time to converge on ImageNet3D or the 100-class subset. These methods don\u2019t require many computational resources to train.\\n\\nMeanwhile neural mesh models (i.e., NMM-sphere) take much longer to train and converge. This is because these models learn part-contrastive features with contrastive losses, which limit the training batch size and generally don\u2019t converge as fast as standard classification objectives. For future work we will explore methods to improve the training efficiency of neural mesh models, such as by involving better foreground/background feature sampling methods or by mining hard-negative pairs.\"}"]}
