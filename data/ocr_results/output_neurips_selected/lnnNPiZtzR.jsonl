The dataset originates in fungal records labeled and curated by experts. It consists of about 350k multi-modal observations that include more than 650k photographs from 5k fine-grained categories and diverse accompanying information, e.g., acquisition metadata, satellite images, and body part segmentation. FungiTastic is the only benchmark that includes a test set with partially DNA-sequenced ground truth of unprecedented label reliability. The benchmark is designed to support (i) standard close-set classification, (ii) open-set classification, (iii) multi-modal classification, (iv) few-shot learning, (v) domain shift, and many more. We provide baseline methods tailored for almost all the use-cases. We provide a multitude of ready-to-use pre-trained models on HuggingFace and a framework for model training. A comprehensive documentation describing the dataset features and the baselines are available at GitHub and Kaggle.\\n\\n1 Introduction\\n\\nBiological problems provide a natural, challenging setting for benchmarking image classification methods. Consider the following aspects inherently present in biological data. The species distribution is typically seasonal and influenced by external factors such as recent precipitation levels. Species categorization is fine-grained, with high intra-class and inter-class variance. The distribution is often long-tailed; for rare species, only a very limited number of observations is available. New species are being discovered, raising the need for the \u201cunknown\u201d class option. Commonly, the set of classes has a hierarchical structure, and different misclassifications may have very different costs. Think of mistaking a poisonous mushroom for an edible one, which is potentially lethal, and an edible mushroom for a poisonous one, which at worse means coming back with an empty basket. Similarly, needlessly administering anti-venom after making a wrong decision about a harmless snake bite may be unpleasant, but its consequences are incomparable to not acting after a venomous bite.\\n\\nThe properties of biological data listed above enable testing of, e.g., both open-set and closed-set categorization methods, robustness to prior and appearance domain shift, performance with limited training data, and dealing with non-standard losses. In contrast, most common benchmarks operate under the independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) assumption, which is made valid by shuffling data and randomly splitting it for training and evaluation. In real-world applications, i.i.d data are rare since training data are collected well before deployment and everything changes over time [37].\"}"]}

In the age of LLMs and VLMs trained on possibly the entire content of the internet at a certain point in time, it is critical to have access to new, \u201cunseen\u201d data to guarantee that the tested methods are not evaluated on data they have indirectly \u201cseen\u201d, without knowing. Conveniently, many domains in nature are of interest to experts and the general public, who both provide a continuous stream of new and annotated data. The general public\u2019s involvement introduces the problem of noisy training data; evaluating robustness to this phenomenon is also of practical importance.\\n\\nIn the paper, we introduce **FungiTastic**, a comprehensive multi-modal dataset of fungi observations which takes advantage of the favourable properties of natural data discussed above. The fungi observations include photographs, satellite images, meteorological observations, segmentation masks, and textual metadata. The metadata enrich the observations with attributes such as the timestamp, camera settings, GPS location, and information about the substrate, habitat, and biological taxonomy. By incorporating various modalities, the dataset support a robust benchmark for multi-modal classification, enabling the development and evaluation of sophisticated machine learning models under realistic and dynamic conditions.\\n\\nClassification of data originating in nature, including images of birds [3][35], plants [13][15], snakes [6][24], and fungi [25][34], has been used for benchmarking machine learning algorithms in several Fine-Grained Visual Categorization challenges; for a summary, see Table 1. Most of the commonly used datasets are small for current standards; the number of classes is also limited. The performance is often saturated, reaching total accuracy between 85-95%; see the rightmost column of Tab. 1. Typically, the datasets are solely image-based and focused on traditional image classification; few of them offer basic attributes in metadata. Moreover, many popular datasets suffer from specific problems, e.g., regional, racial and gender biases [32], errors in labels [33][4], and are saturated in accuracy.\\n\\nTable 1: **Common image classification datasets** selected according to Google Scholar citations. We list suitability for closed-set classification (C), open-set classification (OS), few-shot (FS), segmentation (S), out-of-distribution (OOD) and multi-modal (MM) evaluation and modalities, e.g., images (I), metadata (M), and masks (S), available for training. \\\\( \\\\forall = \\\\{ \\\\text{C, OS, FS, S, OOD, MM} \\\\} \\\\)\\n\\n| Dataset + citations (2022-24) | Classes | Training | Test | Modalities | Tasks | SOTA\u2020 Accuracy |\\n|-------------------------------|---------|----------|------|------------|-------|----------------|\\n| Oxford-IIIT Pets [23]         | 1,060   | 37       | 1,846| 3,669      | \u2713     | 97.1 [12]      |\\n| FGVC Aircraft [21]            | 1,190   | 102      | 6,732| 3,468      | \u2713     | 95.4 [2]       |\\n| Stanford Dogs [17]            | 680     | 120      | 12,000| 8580      | \u2713     | 97.3 [2]       |\\n| Stanford Cars [19]            | 2,060   | 196      | 8,144| 8,041      | \u2713     | 97.1 [20]      |\\n| CUB-200-2011 [35]             | 1,910   | 200      | 5,994| 5,794      | \u2713 \u2713   | 93.1 [7]       |\\n| NABirds [33]                  | 283     | 555      | 48,562| -         | \u2713     | 93.0 [10]      |\\n| PlantNet300k [14]             | 30      | 1,081    | 243,916| 31,112    | \u2713     | 92.4 [14]      |\\n| ImageNet-1k [9]               | 21,200  | 1,000    | 1,281,167| 100,000  | \u2713     | 92.4 [11]      |\\n| iNaturalist [34]              | 727     | 5,089    | 579,184| 95,986    | \u2713     | 93.8 [30]      |\\n| ImageNet-21k [27]             | 456     | 21,841   | 14,197,122| -        | \u2713 \u2713   | 88.3 [30]      |\\n| DF20 [25]                     | 42      | 1,604    | 266,344| 29,594    | \u2713 \u2713   | 80.5 [25]      |\\n| DF20\u2013Mini [25]                | 42      | 182      | 32,753| 3,640      | \u2713 \u2713   | 75.9 [25]      |\\n| FungiTastic                   | \u2014       | 2,829    | 433,701| 91,832    | \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 | 75.3           |\\n| FungiTastic\u2013Mini              | \u2014       | 215      | 46,842| 10,738     | \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 | 74.8           |\"}"]}

We propose four distinct challenges, each with its own evaluation protocol. The remainder of this section is dedicated to a detailed description of each challenge and the associated evaluation metrics:\\n\\n- Fine-grained closed-set classification with heavy long-tailed distribution \u2013 Subsection 3.1\\n- Standard closed-set classification with out-of-distribution (OOD) detection \u2013 Subsection 3.1\\n- Classification with non-standard cost functions \u2013 Subsection 3.3\\n- Classification on a time-sorted dataset for benchmarking adaptation methods \u2013 Subsection 3.2\\n- Few-shot classification of species with a small number of training observations \u2013 Subsection 3.4\\n\\n3.1 Closed and open set classification\\n\\nIn closed-set classification, the set of classes in training and evaluation are the same while open set classification addresses scenarios where the input may belong to an unknown category that was not available during training. In FungiTastic, new species are being added to the database over time, including newly discovered species. The goal of closed-set classification is to develop a model that can classify inputs into known categories while open-set classification requires a model that can also identify inputs that do not belong to any of the known categories.\\n\\nEvaluation: The main evaluation metric is $F$, the macro-averaged F1-score. For closed-set classification, the evaluation is standard, and for open-set, it is defined as\\n\\n$$F = \\\\frac{1}{C} \\\\sum_{c=1}^{C} F_c, \\\\quad F_c = \\\\frac{2P_c \\\\cdot R_c}{P_c + R_c},$$\\n\\nwhere $P_c$ and $R_c$ are the recall and precision of class $c$ and $C$ is the total number of classes, including the unknown class $u$.\\n\\nThe F1-score of the unknown-class, $F^u$, and the F-score over the known classes, $F_k$, are also of particular interest, with $F_k$ defined as\\n\\n$$F_K = \\\\frac{1}{|K|} \\\\sum_{c \\\\in K} F_c,$$\"}"]}

The $F_k$ also corresponds to the main evaluation metric for standard closed-set classification. Additional metrics reported are top-1 and top-3 accuracy, defined as\\n\\n$$\\\\text{Acc}@k = \\\\frac{1}{N} \\\\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\\\mathbf{1}(y_i \\\\in q_k(x_i)),$$\\n\\n(3)\\n\\nwhere $N$ is the total number of samples in the dataset, $x_i, y_i$ are the $i$-th sample and its label and $q_k(x)$ are the top $k$ predictions for sample $x$.\\n\\n### 3.2 Temporal Image Classification\\n\\nEach observation in the FungiTastic (FungiTastic) dataset is associated with a timestamp, enabling the study of how the distribution of different species evolves over time. The distribution of fungi species is seasonal and influenced by weather conditions, such as the amount of precipitation in previous days. Images from new locations may be included over time. This presents a unique real-world benchmark for domain adaptation methods, in particular online, continual and test-time adaptation. The challenge test dataset comprises images of fungi ordered chronologically. Consequently, a model processing an observation with a timestamp $t$ has access to all observations with timestamp $t'$ where $t' < t$.\\n\\n**Evaluation:** The evaluation metrics are the same as those for the open-set recognition problem.\\n\\n### 3.3 Classification beyond 0-1 loss function\\n\\nEvaluation of classification networks is typically based on the 0-1 loss function, such as the mean accuracy, which applies to the metrics defined for the previous challenges as well. In practice, this often falls short of the desired metric since not all errors are equal. In this challenge, we define two practical scenarios: In the first scenario, confusing a poisonous species for an edible one (false positive edible mushroom) incurs a much higher cost than that of a false positive poisonous mushroom prediction. In the second scenario, the cost of not recognizing that an image belongs to a new species should be higher.\\n\\n**Evaluation:** A metric of the following general form should be minimized\\n\\n$$\\\\mathcal{L} = \\\\frac{1}{N} \\\\sum_{i=1}^{N} W(y_i, q_1(x_i)),$$\\n\\n(4)\\n\\nwhere $N$ is the total number of samples, $(x_i, y_i)$ are the $i$-th sample and its label, $q_1(x)$ is the top prediction for sample $x$ and $W \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^{C \\\\times C}$ is the cost matrix, $C$ being the total number of classes. For the poisonous/edible species scenario, we define the cost matrix as\\n\\n$$W^{p/e}(y, q_1(x)) = \\\\begin{cases} 0 & \\\\text{if } d(y) = d(q_1(x)) \\\\\\\\ c_p & \\\\text{if } d(y) = 1 \\\\text{ and } d(q_1(x)) = 0, \\\\\\\\ c_e & \\\\text{otherwise} \\\\end{cases}$$\\n\\n(5)\\n\\nwhere $d(y), y \\\\in C$ is a binary function that indicates dangerous (poisonous) species ($d(y) = 1$), $c_p = 100$ and $c_e = 1$. For the known/unknown species scenario, we define the cost matrix as\\n\\n$$W^{k/u}(y, q_1(x)) = \\\\begin{cases} 0 & \\\\text{if } y = q_1(x) \\\\\\\\ c_u & \\\\text{if } y = u \\\\text{ and } q(x) \\\\neq u, \\\\\\\\ c_k & \\\\text{otherwise} \\\\end{cases}$$\\n\\n(6)\\n\\nwhere $c_u = 10$ and $c_k = 1$. \\n\\n7\"}"]}

A few-shot segmentation approach based on, i.e., metric learning may be preferable both in terms of computational efficiency (retraining/finetuning the classifier to incorporate new species may be expensive) and accuracy.\\n\\nFor these reasons, we exclude the species with less than k observations from the main training set and provide a dedicated sub-dataset, the FungiTastic\u2013FS.\\n\\n**Evaluation:** Since the few-shot dataset does not have a severe class imbalance like the other FungiTastic subsets, this benchmark\u2019s main metric is top-1 accuracy. The F-1 score and top-k total accuracy are also reported. This challenge does not have any \u201cunknown\u201d category.\\n\\n4 Baseline Experiments\\n\\nIn this section, we provide a variety of strong baselines based on state-of-the-art architectures and methods for three FungiTastic benchmarks. A set of pre-trained models was trained (inferred in the case of the few-shot classification) and evaluated on the relevant FungiTastic benchmarks. Below, we report results only for the closed-set and few-shot learning, but other baselines will be provided later in the supplementary materials, in the documentation, or on the dataset website.\\n\\n4.1 Closed-set image classification\\n\\nWe train a variety of state-of-the-art CNN architectures to establish strong baselines for closed-set classification on the FungiTastic and FungiTastic\u2013M. All selected architectures were optimized with Stochastic Gradient Descent, SeeSaw loss [36], momentum set to 0.9 and a mini-batch size of 64 for all architectures, and a learning rate of 0.01 (except ResNet and ResNeXt where we used LR=0.1), which was scheduled based on validation loss. While training, we used a Random Augment [8] data augmentation with a magnitude of 0.2.\\n\\nSimilarly to other fine-grained benchmarks, while the number of params, complexity of the model, and training time remain more or less the same as in convnets, the transformer-based architectures achieved considerably better performance on both FungiTastic and FungiTastic\u2013M and two different input sizes (see Table 4.1). The best performing model, BEiT-Base/p16, achieved $F_1^m$ just around 40% which show severe difficulty of proposed benchmark.\\n\\nTable 4: **Closed-set fine-grained classification FungiTastic and FungiTastic\u2013M** A set of selected state-of-the-art CNN- (top section) and Transformer-based (bottom section) architectures.

The first baseline is standard classifier training with the Cross-Entropy (CE) loss. The other two baselines are nearest-neighbour classification and centroid prototype classification based on deep image embeddings extracted from large-scale pretrained vision models, namely CLIP [26], BioCLIP [31] and Dinov2 [22].\\n\\n**Standard deep classifiers** are trained with the CE loss to output the class probabilities for each input sample. **Nearest neighbours classification** ($k$-NN) constructs a database of training image embeddings. At test time, $k$ nearest neighbours are retrieved and the classification decision is made based on the majority class of the nearest neighbours. **Nearest-centroid-prototype classification** constructs a prototype embedding for each class by aggregating the training data embeddings of the given class. The classification is performed based on the image embedding similarity to the class prototypes. These methods are inspired by prototype networks proposed in [29].\\n\\nWhile DINOv2 [22] embeddings greatly outperform CLIP [26] embeddings, BioCLIP [31] (CLIP finetuned on biological data) outperforms them both, highlighting the dominance of domain-specific models. Further, the centroid-prototype classification always outperforms the nearest-neighbour methods in terms of accuracy, while nearest-neighbour wins over centroid-prototype in F-score. Finally, the best standard classification models trained on the in-domain few-shot dataset underperform both Dinov2 and BioCLIP embeddings in F-score, which shows the power of methods tailored to the few-shot setup. For results summary, refer to Table 5.\\n\\n### 5 Conclusion\\n\\nIn this work, we introduced the FungiTastic, a comprehensive and multi-modal dataset and benchmark. The dataset includes a variety of data types, such as photographs, satellite images, meteorological observations, segmentation masks, and textual metadata. Biological data have many aspects interesting to the community such as long-tailed distribution or distribution shift over time. These aspects make the FungiTastic a rich and challenging benchmark for developing machine learning models.\\n\\nThe benchmark\u2019s challenging nature is demonstrated by classification-SOTA-based baselines. The best closed-set and few-shot classification models achieve an F-score of only 39.8 and 9.1, respectively, unlike many standard benchmarks, where state-of-the-art performance is approaching saturation.\\n\\n**Limitations.** The data distribution is influenced by the data collection process, potentially introducing biases where certain species may be overrepresented due to their prevalence in frequently sampled areas or collector preferences. Nevertheless, we do not see how these biases could influence the image classification method evaluation. Additionally, not all meteorological data are available for every observation, which can affect of multi-modal classification approaches relying on such data.\\n\\n**Future work** includes organizing ongoing challenges to monitor progress in image classification in various scenarios, regularly adding novel data and increasing the annotation coverage.\"}"]}
