Recently, many novel models are proposed for ML on such graphs intensifying the need for robust evaluation and standardized benchmark datasets. However, the availability of such resources remains scarce and evaluation faces added complexity due to reproducibility issues in experimental protocols. To address these challenges, we introduce Temporal Graph Benchmark 2.0 (TGB 2.0), a novel benchmarking framework tailored for evaluating methods for predicting future links on Temporal Knowledge Graphs and Temporal Heterogeneous Graphs with a focus on large-scale datasets, extending the Temporal Graph Benchmark. TGB 2.0 facilitates comprehensive evaluations by presenting eight novel datasets spanning five domains with up to 53 million edges. TGB 2.0 datasets are significantly larger than existing datasets in terms of number of nodes, edges, or timestamps. In addition, TGB 2.0 provides a reproducible and realistic evaluation pipeline for multi-relational temporal graphs. Through extensive experimentation, we observe that 1) leveraging edge-type information is crucial to obtain high performance, 2) simple heuristic baselines are often competitive with more complex methods, 3) most methods fail to run on our largest datasets, highlighting the need for research on more scalable methods.\\n\\n1 Introduction\\n\\nLearning from graph-structured data has become ubiquitous in many applications such as recommendation systems \\\\cite{35, 70}, knowledge base completion \\\\cite{55, 46} and molecular learning \\\\cite{58, 3}. Relational data often evolves over time and can contain multiple types of relations. These complex interactions and temporal dependencies can be captured by \\\\textit{multi-relational} temporal graphs. In recent years, various approaches have emerged to predict future links in such graphs, notably for prediction on Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKGs) \\\\cite{41, 47} and Temporal Heterogeneous Graphs (THGs) \\\\cite{38, 30}. These approaches capture the rich information from multi-relational data, forming distinct lines of research from those of single-relational temporal graphs \\\\cite{61, 50}. However, benchmarking on multi-relational temporal graphs faces two main challenges: \\\\textit{inconsistent evaluation} and \\\\textit{limited dataset size}.\\n\\n\\\\textsuperscript{*}Equal contributions\"}"]}

Circle sizes correspond to the number of timestamps. TGB 2.0 datasets are significantly larger than existing datasets in number of nodes, edges and timestamps.\\n\\n**Inconsistent Evaluation.** Evaluation for multi-relational temporal graphs faces significant challenges. Recently, it was shown that existing evaluation for TKGs has inconsistencies in a) the evaluation metrics, b) mixing multi-step and single-step prediction settings and c) using different versions of the same dataset [16]. Similar inconsistencies have been observed in related areas such as link prediction on static knowledge graphs [67, 60], node and graph classification on static graphs [64, 13], and temporal graph link prediction [28]. In addition, for link prediction on THGs, existing evaluation often includes a single random negative per positive edge [38, 72], leading to over-optimistic performances, inconsistent evaluation, and reducing performance differentiation between methods [57].\\n\\n**Limited Dataset Size.** Existing evaluations are conducted on predominantly small-scale datasets. For example, commonly used TKG and THG datasets consist of less than two million edges and one million nodes [38, 30, 41, 39]. However, real world networks typically contain tens of millions of nodes and edges thus existing datasets rarely reflect the true scale of datasets in practice. In addition, significant efforts were made to design scalable graph learning methods for real applications which requires the availability of large scale datasets [27, 26, 28]. These challenges hinder meaningful comparisons between methods and the accurate assessment of progress, and hamper advancements in the field. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a public and standardized benchmark to facilitate proper and fair comparison between methods, accelerating research for multi-relational temporal graphs.\\n\\nTo address the aforementioned challenges, we present TGB 2.0, a novel benchmark designed for future link prediction on multi-relational temporal graphs. Building upon the foundations of the Temporal Graph Benchmark (TGB) [29] where only single-relation temporal graphs are included, TGB 2.0 introduces multi-relational temporal graph datasets. TGB 2.0 adds four novel TKG datasets and four novel THG datasets of varying scale, spanning five domains. Figure 1 shows the difference in scale of the novel datasets in TGB 2.0 when compared to existing ones. Figure 1a shows that TGB 2.0 TKG datasets (marked in orange) are orders of magnitude larger than existing ones in terms of number of nodes, edges and timestamps. Figure 1b shows that TGB 2.0 THG datasets (marked in green) are significantly larger than existing datasets, with thgl-myket dataset quintupling the number of edges and timestamps, while thgl-github has the most number of nodes to date. Additionally, TGB 2.0 provides an automated evaluation pipeline for reproducible and realistic evaluation on multi-relational temporal graphs. In TGB 2.0, the dynamic link property prediction task is treated as a ranking problem where multiple negative edges are ranked against the positive edge. For large datasets, we sample negative edges based on the edge type of the query, and thus closely approximate the complete evaluation where all negative edges are used. Overall, TGB 2.0 presents a benchmark for realistic, challenging, and reproducible evaluation on multi-relational temporal graphs while providing an automated pipeline for dataset downloading, processing, evaluation as well as a public leaderboard. TGB 2.0 has the following main contributions:\\n\\n- **Large and diverse datasets for multi-relational graphs.** We present four novel TKGs that are orders of magnitude larger than existing ones and four novel THGs that are significantly larger in number of nodes, edges and timestamps when compared with current ones.\\n\\n- **Realistic and reproducible evaluation.** We provide an evaluation pipeline for multi-relational temporal graphs, which automates the dataset downloading, processing and benchmarking process.\"}"]}

TGB 2.0 evaluation uses the ranking metric MRR and samples challenging negative edges based on the edge type information, hence providing realistic evaluation.\\n\\n- **Experimental insights.** The main insight from our experiments is that for both THGs and TKGs, all methods (apart from heuristics) fail to scale to our largest datasets, highlighting the need for more research on scalable methods. Surprisingly, the heuristic baselines perform competitively with more sophisticated methods. On THG datasets, we observe that methods that leverage the edge type and node type information achieve strong performance. Finally, across TKG datasets, we observe a strong correlation between the recurrency degree of a given relation type and the performance of methods, suggesting large room for improvement on low recurrency relations.\\n\\n**Reproducibility.** TGB 2.0 code and datasets are publicly available (see Appendix C for download links) and the TGB 2.0 website provides detailed documentation.\\n\\n## 2 Preliminaries\\n\\n**Temporal Knowledge Graphs:** A *Temporal Knowledge Graph* (TKG) $G_K$ is a set of quadruples $(s, r, o, t)$ with subject and object entities $s, o \\\\in V$ (the set of entities), relation $r \\\\in R$ (the set of possible relations), and timestamp $t$. The semantic meaning of a quadruple $(s, r, o, t)$ is that $s$ is in relation $r$ to $o$ at time $t$. We also refer to quadruples as temporal triples, or simply as edges.\\n\\n**Temporal Heterogeneous Graphs:** A *Temporal Heterogeneous Graph* (THG) $G_H$ is similarly a set of quadruples, $(s, r, o, t) \\\\in E$ where $s, o \\\\in V$ are entities, $r$ is the relation and $t$ is a timestamp, along with a node type function $\\\\phi : V \\\\rightarrow A$. THG are equivalent to TKG with the addition that each node is assigned a fixed type (consistent over time) by the node type function.\\n\\n**Temporal Graph Forecasting (Extrapolation):** Given a Temporal multi-relational Graph $G_K$ or $G_H$, Temporal Graph Forecasting or Extrapolation is the task of predicting edges for future timesteps $t^+$. Akin to (static) multi-relational graph completion, temporal multi-relational graph forecasting is approached as a ranking task [21]. For a given query, e.g. $(s, r, ?, t^+)$, methods rank all entities in $V$ as possible objects using a scoring function, assigning plausibility scores to each quadruple. In TGB 2.0, we focus on the temporal graph forecasting task.\\n\\n**Time Representations.** There are two approaches for representing time in temporal graphs: (a) *discrete*, where graphs are modeled as snapshots $G_t$ containing all edges appearing at time $t$, and (b) graphs that can be conceptualized as a series of edges arriving at *continuous* timestamps. In practice, TKGs are often represented as snapshots and TKG methods are tailored for discrete time representations [41, 39, 47, 66]. This choice is driven by the discrete nature of the data sources and the suitability of snapshot-based representations for downstream tasks. Therefore, we represent TKGs as snapshots in TGB 2.0. In comparison, THG data sources are often continuous in nature (recorded in second-wise interactions), while both discrete and continuous approaches for THGs are developed [38, 10, 72]. It is often argued that continuous representations preserve more information and can be converted to discrete while the reverse is not true [33]. Therefore, the THG datasets are represented in the continuous format.\\n\\n## 3 Related Work\\n\\n**TKG Methods.**\\n\\nMost TKG forecasting methods utilize a discrete time representation, except for [24]. Some methods integrate the message-passing paradigm from static graphs [63, 53] with sequential techniques [32, 41, 22, 23, 39, 45]. Other approaches combine Reinforcement Learning with temporal reasoning for future link prediction [40, 66]. Rule-based methods [47, 34, 52, 48, 44] employ strategies to learn temporal logic rules while others [76, 71, 75] combines a blend of different methodologies. More details are in Appendix H.1. For more comprehensive discussions on methods and applications of TKG, we refer to the surveys [8, 9, 43], and [69]. For TKG forecasting, common benchmark datasets include YAGO [51], WIKI [36, 31], GDELT [37] and the Integrated Crisis Early Warning System (ICEWS) dataset [6]. However, these datasets are orders of magnitude smaller than our TKG datasets in number of nodes, edges and timestamps. In tkgl-icews, we include the full ICEWS dataset [6] spanning 28 years when comparing to prior versions containing only one or a\"}"]}

Similarly, our \\\\texttt{tkgl-wikidata} dataset is orders of magnitude larger than the existing WIKI dataset \\\\cite{15,42} in size of nodes, edges and timestamps.\\n\\n**THG Methods.** THG methods can be categorized based on their time representation: discrete-time methods and continuous-time methods. Examples of continuous time methods include HTGN-BTW \\\\cite{74} and STHN \\\\cite{38}. HTGN-BTW \\\\cite{74} enables TGN \\\\cite{61} to accommodate heterogeneous node and edge types. STHN \\\\cite{38} utilizes a link encoder and patching techniques to incorporate edge type and time information respectively. Discrete-time methods include random walk based methods \\\\cite{5,73} and message-passing based methods \\\\cite{72,10}. However, it is difficult to adapt discrete-time methods for continuous-time datasets. More details are provided in Appendix \\\\ref{sec:appendix-h}. Common THG datasets such as MathOverflow \\\\cite{56}, Netflix \\\\cite{4} and Movielens \\\\cite{25} are small and only contain a few million edges \\\\cite{38}. Large datasets such as Dataset A and B from the WSDM 2022 Challenge and the TRACE and THEIA datasets \\\\cite{59} are only evaluated with one negative sample per positive edge, which is shown to lead to over-optimistic and insufficient evaluation \\\\cite{28,57}.

Recently, the Temporal Graph Benchmark was introduced for temporal graph learning, consisting of large datasets for single-relation temporal graphs \\\\cite{28}. In this work, we introduce novel TKG and THG datasets, incorporating multi-relational temporal graphs into TGB. Recently, detailed performance comparison for deep learning methods on dynamic graphs are conducted in \\\\cite{19}, however multi-relational temporal graph datasets were not included in the comparison. While efforts like \\\\cite{16} have highlighted evaluation inconsistencies in TKG, their study focuses on existing smaller-scale datasets where no novel evaluation framework were proposed. Moreover, recent findings by \\\\cite{15} reveal that a simple heuristic baseline outperforms existing methods on some datasets, thus underscores the necessity for comparison with baselines. In this work, TGB 2.0 includes four novel TKG and four novel THG datasets as well as a standardized and reproducible evaluation pipeline.\\n\\n## 4 Datasets\\n\\nTGB 2.0 introduces eight novel datasets from five distinct domains consisting of four TKGs and four THGs. We split all datasets chronologically into training, validation, and test sets, respectively containing 70\\\\%, 15\\\\%, and 15\\\\% of all edges in line with existing studies \\\\cite{28,61,50} and ensure that edges of a timestamp can only exist in either train or validation or test set.\\\\footnote{We detail the exact number of timestamps and edges for each subset in Appendix \\\\ref{sec:appendix-g}} We present the dataset licenses and download links in Appendix \\\\ref{sec:appendix-d}.

The temporal relations either describe point in time relations (event-based) or relations with duration (fact-based). We also provide static relations from the same set of Wikidata pages which include 978,315 edges that can be used to enhance model performance.

The task is to predict the next activity of a given entity, e.g., which pull request the user will close at a given time.\\n\\n**thgl-forum.** This THG dataset is based on the user and subreddit interaction network on Reddit [54]. The node types encode users or subreddits, the edge relations are \u201cuser reply to user\u201d and \u201cuser -post\u201d in subreddits. The dataset contains interactions from January 2014. The task is to predict which user or subreddit a user will interact with at a given time.\\n\\n**thgl-myket.** This THG dataset is based on the Myket Android App market. Each edge documents the user installation or update interaction within the Myket market. The data spans six months and two weeks and when compared to an existing smaller version [49], this dataset contains the full data without downsampling. Overall, the dataset includes information on 206,939 applications and over 1.3 million anonymized users from June 2020 to January 2021.\\n\\n**thgl-github.** This THG dataset is based on Github data collected from the [GH Arxiv](https://github.com).

The nodes with two or fewer edges are filtered out. The dataset contains the network as of March 2024.

TGB 2.0 datasets vary significantly in scale for number of nodes, edges, and time steps. We observe an increase in runtime and memory requirements from tkgl-smallpedia to tkgl-polecat to tkgl-icews and tkgl-wikidata. In practice, these requirements depend on the combination of number of nodes, edges and time steps. To account for such benchmarking requirements, we categorize the datasets into small, medium and large datasets. Small datasets are suitable for prototyping methods, while medium and large datasets test method performance at increasingly large scales.\\n\\nTable 1 reports dataset statistics: the Proportion of Inductive Test Nodes (Induct.

Also, we represent a novel metric called Consecutiveness Value (Con), which quantifies if a given temporal triples repeats at consecutive timestamps by averaging the maximum number of consecutive timesteps during which a triple holds true across all triples in the dataset. Intuitively, fact-based relations which are true across multiple consecutive time steps will result in a higher Consecutiveness Value.\\n\\nDiverse Statistics. TGB 2.0 datasets exhibits diverse dataset statistics. For example, tkgl-wikidata, tkgl-smallpedia, tkgl-polecat and thgl-software all have more than 10% test nodes that are inductive (i.e. nodes unseen in the training set), thus testing the inductive capability of methods. Variations in the recurrence of relations are evident with tkgl-smallpedia and tkgl-wikidata showing higher Recurrency Degrees compared to others. The DRec highlights the disparities between THG and TKG datasets, where the finer, second-wise time granularity of THG leads to a DRec of 0 implying no repetition of facts across subsequent time steps. On TKG datasets, the high Consecutiveness Value for tkgl-smallpedia and tkgl-wikidata exhibit a prevalence of long-lasting facts, contrasting with tkgl-icews and tkgl-polecat which documents political events. In comparison, THG datasets describe one-time events, thus displaying lower Con values.\\n\\nFigure 2 shows the number of edges per timestamp for tkgl-smallpedia and thgl-software, reported over twenty bins with bars showing the min/max in each bin. Similar figures for other datasets are given in Appendix F. Figure 2 underscores distinctions between datasets, particularly in terms of time granularity and trend patterns. TKG datasets demonstrate a coarser time granularity leading to a significantly higher edge count per timestep compared to THG datasets. thgl-software exhibits relatively constant number of edges over time (with peaks at specific time points). In comparison, tkgl-smallpedia exhibit significant growth in edge count closer to the end. This is because tkgl-smallpedia starts from 1900 and ends at 2024, as time gets closer to current era, the amount of digitized and documented information increases significantly. The reduced number of edges in the final bin is due to the fact that the knowledge from 2024 remains incomplete as of this writing.\\n\\nFigure 3 illustrates the distribution of the ten most prominent relations in tkgl-smallpedia and thgl-software. More Figures are in Appendix F. There are highly frequent relation types in tkgl-smallpedia such as member of sports team which occupies 28% of all edges; the portion of edges quickly reduces for other relations. In thgl-software, there is a relatively even split in the portion of edges for the most prominent relations with the top seven relations each occupying more than 10% of edges. These figure show the diversity of relations and their distributions in TGB 2.0.\\n\\n5 Experiments\\n\\nEvaluation Protocol. In TGB 2.0, we focus on the dynamic link property prediction task where the goal is to predict the property (often existence) of a link between a pair of nodes in a future timestamp. Here, we treat the link prediction task as ranking problem similar to [27, 28, 16]. The model is required to assign the true edge with the highest probability from multiple negative edges (also referred to as corrupted triples in the TKG literature). The evaluation metric is the time-aware filtered Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) following [16, 28]. The MRR computes the average of the\"}"]}

We find that randomly sampling the negative edges, omitting the edge types, results in over-optimistic MRRs, making the prediction easy. We thus propose to incorporate the edge type information into the negative sampling process for more robust evaluation. For the large TKG dataset \\\\(tkgl\\\\text{-wikidata}\\\\), we first identify possible tails for each edge type throughout the dataset and then sample the negatives based on the edge type of the query. If there are not enough tails in a given edge type, we then randomly sample the remaining ones. For all THG datasets, we sample all destination nodes with the same node type as the true destination node, thus considering the tail node type associated with a given edge type. We conduct an ablation study to show the effectiveness of our sampling strategy in Appendix G.5 on the \\\\(tkgl\\\\text{-smallpedia}\\\\) dataset. We find that our sampling results in closer MRR to that of the \\\\(1\\\\text{-vs-all}\\\\) than random sampling.\\n\\n5.1 Temporal Knowledge Graph Experiments\\n\\nFor TKG experiments, we include RE-GCN \\\\([41]\\\\), TLogic \\\\([47]\\\\), CEN \\\\([39]\\\\) as well as two deterministic heuristic baselines: the Recurrency Baseline (RecB) \\\\([15]\\\\) and EdgeBank \\\\([57]\\\\).

The relations for each dataset are ordered by decreasing Recurrency Degrees.\\n\\nthat no single method exhibits superior performance across all four datasets. Surprisingly, the RecB heuristic performs competitively across most datasets while being among the best performing on tkgl-smallpedia and tkgl-icews, underscoring the importance of including simple baselines in comparison and suggesting potential areas for improvement in other methods. The Edgebank heuristic, originally designed for homogenous temporal graphs, exhibits low performance, highlighting the importance of utilizing the rich multi-relational information for TKG learning. On the large tkgl-wikidata dataset, however, Edgebank is the only method that can scale to such size, likely due to the fact that it omits edge type information. This highlights the need for scalable methods. On another note, methods achieve higher MRRs on datasets characterized by high Recurrency Degrees and Consecutiveness values (tkgl-smallpedia, tkgl-wikidata), despite the presence of a considerable number of inductive nodes in these datasets.\\n\\n**Per-relation Analysis.** Figure 4 illustrates the performance per relation of selected methods across three datasets. For each dataset, we show the ten most frequent relations, ordered by decreasing Recurrency Degree with the color reflecting the Recurrency Degree of each relation. Note that the y-axis scale varies across datasets. We observe distinct patterns in relation-specific performance across datasets: while results on tkgl-polecat exhibit consistent performance across relations, suggesting a relative homogeneity, results on the tkgl-smallpedia dataset shows significant variance, indicating a higher degree of variation among relations. Interestingly, there is strong correlation between the Recurrency Degree and performance, most evident within the tkgl-smallpedia dataset.\\n\\n### 5.2 Temporal Heterogenous Graph Experiments\\n\\nFor THG experiments, we include TGN [61] (with and without edge type information), STHN [38], RecB [15], and EdgeBank [57]. Table 3 reports the average performance and standard deviation across 5 runs for each method. Scalability is a significant challenge for THG methods on large datasets such as thgl-forum and thgl-myket, more details can be found in Appendix C. Most methods either are out of memory or out of time for these datasets. STHN achieves the highest performance on thgl-software dataset showing methods designed for THG can achieve significant performance gain. However, STHN is the least scalable, requiring 185 GB of memory for thgl-software to compute subgraphs and unable to scale to other datasets. The widely-used TGN model [61] for single-relation temporal graph learning is also adapted here, with a modification to incorporate the edge type information as edge feature. We observe significant improvement when TGN utilizes edge\\n\\n---\\n\\n3 The relation description can be found based on their relation ID in Figure 7 in Appendix.\"}"]}

Lastly, EdgeBank achieves competitive performance with that of TGN while being scalable to large datasets. Thus, it is important to evaluate against simple baselines to understand method performances.\\n\\n6 Conclusion\\n\\nIn this work, we introduce TGB 2.0, a novel benchmark for reproducible, realistic, and robust evaluation on multi-relational temporal graphs that is building on the Temporal Graph Benchmark (TGB). We present four new TKG and four new THG datasets which introduce multi-relation datasets in TGB. TGB 2.0 datasets are significantly larger than existing ones while being diverse in statistics and dataset domains. TGB 2.0 focuses on the dynamic link property prediction task and provides an automated pipeline for dataset downloading, processing, method evaluation, and a public leaderboard to track progress. From our experiments, we find that both TKG and THG methods struggle to tackle large scale datasets in TGB 2.0, often resulting in overly long runtime or exceeding the memory limit. Therefore, scalability is an important future direction. Another observation is that heuristic methods achieve competitive results on TKG and THG datasets. This highlights the importance of the inclusion of simple baselines and underlines the room for improvement for current methods.\\n\\nLimitations This work exclusively considers the continuous-time setting for THG datasets. Depending on the application, either the continuous-time or discrete-time setting may be more appropriate. However, the continuous-time setting is often regarded as the more general framework. However, many THG methods are designed for discrete settings. Thus, in future work, discretized versions of the data sets could be added for comparative analysis between discrete methods. Additionally, the TGB 2.0 dataset collection currently includes datasets from only five distinct domains. Notably, domains such as biological networks and citation networks are not represented. To address this limitation, we plan to expand the dataset collection by incorporating additional datasets based on community feedback, thereby enhancing the diversity and comprehensiveness of the dataset repository. As temporal graph data often records interactions between individuals or other sensitive information, data privacy is a potential concern. Sensitive information may be stored as node level or link level attributes thus proper anonymization of data should always be a top priority. In this work, we anonymize user information where appropriate to prevent the leakage of identifiable information.\\n\\nAcknowledgment\\n\\nWe express our gratitude to Myket Corporation for generously providing the anonymous interaction data utilized in this research.

Recently, the availability of large graph benchmarks accelerates research in the field [27, 26, 12]. By providing a standardized benchmarking framework, TGB 2.0 will accelerate the development and evaluation of new models for temporal knowledge graphs and temporal heterogeneous graphs. Researchers can build on a common foundation, leading to more rapid and robust advancements in this field. In addition, the introduction of a unified evaluation framework addresses reproducibility issues, which are critical to scientific progress. The comprehensive evaluation facilitated by TGB 2.0 ensures that new methods are rigorously tested against state-of-the-art baselines, leading to more robust and well-validated models. This contributes to higher standards in research and more reliable outcomes. Overall, this work has the potential to significantly impact both the academic research community and practical applications, driving forward the understanding and utilization of multi-relational temporal graphs in various fields.\"}"]}

The TGB 2.0 datasets may limit the utilization and mining of other TG datasets. If the datasets are not representative of the broader set of real-world data, this could lead to biased or unfair outcomes when models are applied in practice. Similarly, the community might become overly dependent on the TGB 2.0 framework, potentially hindering the exploration of alternative benchmarking methodologies or the development of diverse evaluation protocols that might be more suitable for specific contexts or emerging sub-fields. In addition, when the focus is mainly on quantitative performance metrics, it could overshadow the importance of qualitative assessments and other critical factors, such as interpretability, fairness, and ethical considerations in the development and implementation of models. To avoid this issue, we plan to update TGB 2.0 regularly with community feedback as well as adding additional datasets and tasks.\\n\\nC Dataset Documentation and Intended Use\\n\\nAll datasets presented by TGB 2.0 are intended for academic use and their corresponding licenses are listed in Appendix D.

Figures 6 shows how the number of edges change over time for THG datasets. While most datasets exhibit fluctuations in the number of edges around a constant level, tkgl-wikidata stands out with a significant upward trend in the number of edges over the years, indicating a surge in events, particularly in recent years. In addition, noteworthy deviations in timesteps are apparent. TKG datasets display anomalous timesteps characterized by minimal edge numbers, particularly evident during the Covid pandemic for tkgl-icews. Conversely, for the THG datasets the occurrence of zero-edge timesteps is not indicative of outliers; rather, it reflects the continuous nature of the data, where not every second entails an event occurrence. THG datasets exhibit instances of exceptionally high edge counts per timestep, such as in the case of thgl-forum with up to 120 edges per timestamp.\\n\\nFigure 7 shows the top ten most frequent edge types in TKG datasets. Figure 8 shows the top ten most frequent edge types in THG datasets. Note that TKG datasets in general have more edge types than THG datasets.

Note that the Recurrency Baseline, EdgeBank, and TLogic only require CPU thus no GPU usage is reported.

We also compare our sampling method based on destination nodes of each edge type (1-vs-\\\\(q\\\\) (ours)) with that of random sampling (1-vs-\\\\(q\\\\) (random)). We select the tkgl-smallpedia dataset and report results for the Recurrency Baseline as well as Edgebank, as both methods perform competitively while being deterministic. Table 9 confirms expectations: random negative sampling yields the highest MRR values. MRR values for our destination-aware negative sampling demonstrate a closer proximity to the full sampling (1-vs-all) for both methodologies. Notably, employing the 1-vs-all approach yields the lowest MRR for both test and validation sets, underscoring the importance of comprehensive evaluations whenever feasible. However, particularly evident in the case of Edgebank, the adoption of negative sampling significantly reduces test time, changing from approximately 3000 seconds to 70 seconds.\\n\\nG.6 Details on Evaluation Protocol\\n\\nAs described in section\\\\[1\\\\] we compute the time-aware Mean Reciprocal Rank \\\\[16\\\\]. Specifically, for each test edge \\\\((s_{test}, r_{test}, o_{test}, t_{test})\\\\), we evaluate the models prediction by removing the object \\\\(o_{test}\\\\) from the test query, \\\\((s_{test}, r_{test}, ?, t_{test})\\\\). The model then assigns scores to all possible entities for the object position, which are subsequently ranked in descending order. This is repeated for subject prediction. The MRR is calculated as the mean of the reciprocal of these ranks across all test queries. In applying the time-aware filter setting, we filter out quadruples that have the same timestamp as the test query. For example, for a test query (France, wins, Basketball Match, 2025-05-19) a model\u2019s prediction (France, wins, Soccer Match, 2025-05-19) would be excluded if (France, wins, Soccer Match, 2025-05-19) is present in the test set. However, it would not be filtered out if (France, wins, Soccer Match, 2025-03-09) is present in the test set.\\n\\nWe evaluate all methods in single-step prediction. This means that the model always forecasts the next timestep, and then ground truth facts are fed before predicting the subsequent timestep \\\\[16\\\\]. If there are multiple triples in the candidate set with the same score from the model, our protocol assigns the average rank, i.e. the average between the worst (pessimistic) and best (optimistic) score, to the ground truth triple.\\n\\nThe scripts for generating the negative samples can be found\\\\[here\\\\] under the folder for each individual dataset\\\\[4\\\\]. We select the following negative sampling strategies for each dataset:\\n\\n- tkgl-smallpedia, tkgl-polecat, tkgl-icews: 1-vs-all\\n- tkgl-wikidata, thgl-software: 1-vs-\\\\(q\\\\) with \\\\(q = 1000\\\\)\\n- thgl-github, thgl-myket: 1-vs-\\\\(q\\\\) with \\\\(q = 20\\\\)\\n- thgl-forum: 1-vs-\\\\(q\\\\) with \\\\(q = 100\\\\)\\n\\n\\\\[4\\\\]the scripts all have suffix of ns_gen.py\"}"]}

We base our selection on a) code availability, b) comparatively high performance in previous studies on smaller datasets (following results as reported in [16] and [15], i.e. we exclude methods that are reported to have lower MRRs on all previous datasets as compared to the Recurrency Baseline), and c) we exclude methods that have reported to have long runtimes or high GPU memory consumption on the existing smaller datasets (e.g. [22] for the GDELT dataset [16]). This results in the following TKG baselines:\\n\\n- **RE-GCN [41]** learns from the sequence of Knowledge Graph snapshots recurrently by combining a convolutional graph Neural Network with a sequential Neural Network model. It also incorporates a static graph constraint to include additional information like entity types.\\n- **CEN [39]** integrates a GCN capable of handling evolitional patterns of different lengths through a learning strategy that progresses from short to long patterns. This model can\"}"]}

It applies these rules to events preceding the query, considering both the confidence of the rules and the time differences for scoring answer candidates.\\n\\n- Recurrency Baseline [15] is a baseline method that predicts recurring facts by combining scores based on strict recurrency, considering the recency and frequency of these facts, and scores based on relaxed recurrency, which accounts for the recurrence of parts of the query. Two versions of this baseline are tested: RecB\\\\textsubscript{default}, which uses default parameter values, and RecB\\\\textsubscript{train}, which selects parameter values based on a grid search considering performance on the validation set.\\n\\n### H.2 Temporal Heterogeneous Graph Forecasting\\n\\n- **TGN** [61] represents a comprehensive framework designed for learning on dynamic graphs in continuous time. Its components include a memory module, message function, message aggregator, memory updater, and embedding module. During testing, TGN updates the memories of nodes with edges that have been newly observed. Additionally, to incorporate edge types into TGN, we devised a variant of TGN capable of utilizing edge type information. This was achieved by generating embeddings from the edge types, which were then concatenated with the original messages within the TGN model.\\n\\n- **STHN** [38] designed for continuous-time link prediction on Temporal heterogeneous networks that efficiently manages dynamic interactions. The architecture consists of a *Heterogeneous Link Encoder* with type and time encoding components, which embed historical interactions to produce a temporal link representation. The process continues with *Semantic Patches Fusion*, where sequential representations are divided into different patches treated as token inputs for the Encoder, and average mean pooling compresses these into a single vector. Finally, the framework combines the representations of nodes $u$ and $v$, utilizing a fully connected layer and *CrossEntropy* loss for link prediction, effectively capturing complex temporal information and long-term dependencies.\\n\\n### I Datasheets for Datasets\\n\\nThis section answers questions about this work based on Datasheets for Datasets [17].\\n\\n#### I.0.1 Motivation\\n\\n- **For what purpose was the dataset created?** Was there a specific task in mind?
