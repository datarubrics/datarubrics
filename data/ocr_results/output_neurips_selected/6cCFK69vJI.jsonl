Additionally, they contribute significantly to global energy consumption, accounting for one-third of total energy usage, and carbon emissions. Optimizing building performance presents a vital opportunity to combat climate change and promote human flourishing. However, research in building analytics has been hampered by the lack of accessible, available, and comprehensive real-world datasets on multiple building operations. In this paper, we introduce the Building TimeSeries (BTS) dataset. Our dataset covers three buildings over a three-year period, comprising more than ten thousand timeseries data points with hundreds of unique classes. Moreover, the metadata is standardized using the Brick schema. To demonstrate the utility of this dataset, we performed benchmarks on the multi-label timeseries classification task. This task represent an essential initial step in addressing challenges related to interoperability in building analytics. Access to the dataset and the code used for benchmarking are available here: https://github.com/cruiseresearchgroup/DIEF_BTS\\n\\n1 Introduction\\n\\nImportance of building analytics. Building analytics, also known as data-driven smart building [12], involves the automated adjustment of building operations to minimize emissions and costs, optimize energy usage, and enhance indoor environmental quality and occupant experience, including comfort, health, and safety [72]. This is particularly crucial given that buildings account for a third of global energy usage and a quarter of global carbon emissions, comparable to the transport sector [27]. Optimizing building performance has the potential to significantly mitigate climate change and promote human well-being.\\n\\nLiterature gaps. This paper addresses two critical gaps in building analytics research. Firstly, in Section 2.1 we highlight the scarcity of publicly available and freely accessible datasets on comprehensive real-world building operations, as exemplified in Table 1. While LBNL59 [49, 36] is the only dataset that captures various aspects of building operations comprehensively, it only includes data from a single building.\\n\\n*School of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE), University of New South Wales (UNSW).\\n\u2020Sustainable Buildings Research Centre (SBRC), University of Wollongong (UOW).\\n\u2021Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO).\"}"]}

Interoperability is crucial for scalability, allowing models to be applied across diverse buildings with differing characteristics such as climate, usage, size, regulations, budget, and architecture. This challenge is discussed further in Section 2.2. Additionally, such datasets inherently possess properties of interest to machine learning research, such as domain shift, multimodality, imbalance, and long-tailedness, which are discussed further in Section 2.3.\\n\\n**Building TimeSeries (BTS): A new dataset.** In this paper, we introduce a new anonymized building analytics dataset sourced from three buildings located in undisclosed regions across Australia. Spanning a three-year period, our dataset encompasses over ten thousand timeseries data points, featuring a diverse array of 240 unique classes. Notably, this surpasses the ontological breadth of LBNL59 by more than threefold. These ontologies serve as standardized categorizations of building timeseries data, including parameters like Temperature_Setpoint and Voltage_Sensor. The breadth of ontologies within our dataset enables researchers to explore buildings with more intricate analytics setups, facilitating deeper insights into building dynamics and performance. Furthermore, the metadata are standardized using the popular Brick schema [7], ensuring consistency and compatibility across analyses.\\n\\n**A Benchmark.** To demonstrate the utility of this dataset, we conducted benchmarks on a machine learning model interoperability task: multi-label timeseries classification. One of the initial steps in achieving building analytics interoperability is to map thousands of heterogeneous timeseries generated from sensors and actuators to a standardized ontology, such as the Brick schema [7]. This is also known as the timeseries ontology classification task [67].\\n\\nWe also performed an additional benchmark on a zero-shot forecasting task [19, 28]. This explores scenarios where a building manager deploys a pre-trained model without fine-tuning. This task is more complex than typical setups because the model must generalize to an arbitrary number of timeseries, various permutations of their ontologies, and their relationships [45]. The details can be found in Appendix D.\\n\\n**Contribution.** This paper introduces the Building TimeSeries (BTS) dataset, addressing critical gaps in publicly available building analytics datasets. Existing datasets often lack accessible, available, comprehensive, real-world, building operations data, hindering progress in building analytics research. While some datasets like LBNL59 offer a holistic view, they are limited to single buildings, impeding efforts to achieve interoperability in building analytics models. BTS fills this void by providing data from three diverse buildings, spanning a three-year period and encompassing over ten thousand timeseries data points and 240 unique classes. Moreover, BTS inherently possess properties relevant to machine learning research, including domain shift, multimodality, imbalance, and long-tailedness. Furthermore, we conduct a benchmark on a machine learning model interoperability task \u2014 multi-label timeseries classification \u2014 demonstrating BTS\u2019s utility in addressing challenges related to interoperability in building analytics. Overall, BTS dataset advances the pursuit of optimizing building performance, ultimately aiding efforts to mitigate climate change and enhance human flourishing.\"}"]}

We found that, in most cases, the datasets are private, static, simulation-based, or limited in ontology. Although our review is not systematic as this is not a review paper, our search was sufficiently extensive to ensure the validity of our findings. The datasets discussed here are primarily derived from five recent review papers [59, 72, 39, 40, 44] along with our own collections. This would have included earlier surveys such as [6]. Table 4 in the appendix list the works mentioned in this section.\\n\\n**Availability and Accessibility.** Most research on building analytics uses private datasets [82]. This is due to security and privacy concerns of building owners and occupants. This is prevalent across many aspects of building analytics, from HVAC [69, 33, 77, 71, 30, 29, 20], energy use [60, 61], and more holistic systems [34, 35, 23, 42, 43, 67].\\n\\nSome datasets are publicly accessible, but not for free, such as Pecan Street [14], or not freely available, such as ecobee [21]. Notably, the Mortar dataset [22], which comprises data from 90 buildings and over 9.1 billion data points, is currently unavailable due to cloud deployment issues at the time of writing.\\n\\n**Building Operation.** Most public datasets such as EUBUCCO [53] only contain static information such as type, height, and construction year. However, these datasets do not contain sufficient information on building operation. Others contain more extensive information, such as PLUTO [17] and GBMI [10] with more than 70 fields and 380 fields respectively, or building polygons [87] and 3D shapes [9].\\n\\nWhile many public datasets include time information, they are often too sparse (yearly) to be useful for building analytics, which require at least daily data. Examples include the popular CBECS [16], and larger ones like BERTOOL [75] and CENED+2 [68], each containing about a million instances.\\n\\n**Real-World and Not Simulation.** Simulations, while valuable, present limitations due to their reliance on assumptions that may not accurately reflect real-world building systems and human behaviors [95, 72]. Results have been shown to diverge from actual telemetry data in multiple studies [74, 1, 76]. These simulations are often calibrated to match existing datasets such as BEM4CBECS [2, 91, 92, 90] which are based on the CBECS dataset [16], while ResStock [84] and ComStock [58] are based on data from 2.3 million meters in the US [85]. Another notable examples are CityLearn Challenge Series [81, 54, 57, 56]. Not all simulations are software-based. There are also hardware-in-the-loop laboratory setup [65, 64].\\n\\n**Whole Building Scope.** The few remaining datasets are listed on Tab. 1. They have limited scope, and does not fully capture the entire building as a holistic system. For example, most datasets are focused only on aggregated energy load (UCI [78]), or disaggregated (ASHRAE [32, 31, 37], BDG [52, 51], NILM [59]), or when combined with generation [5], or price [79]. Others focuses on occupancy patterns [25, 24, 18, 47] or water [13, 70].\\n\\nTo our knowledge, LBNL59 [49, 36], a medium-sized office building in Berkeley, is the only comprehensive existing dataset. Our dataset complements this dataset by introducing three new buildings, with more diverse ontology. This allows the exploration various transfer learning techniques to ensure that machine learning models are interoperable between buildings. In Section 3.2 we make a detailed comparison of LBNL59 with our dataset.\\n\\n2.2 Relevant Challenges in Building Analytics\\n\\nThe standardization of building timeseries data overcomes the challenge of interoperability and scalability that can give rise to greater widespread adoption of energy flexibility in a systematic manner. Achieving zero-energy buildings has two conflicting optimization goals: to maximise occupant comfort and indoor environmental quality, and to minimise carbon emissions and operating costs [41]. It involves two components: the building model that represents the thermodynamics and energy behavior of a building and its components such as its construction, materials, and HVAC system, and secondly, a control strategy to automate the control operations.\"}"]}

This is further amplified by requiring individual models for each building. These models can be white-box (physics-based) [95, 80], black-box (data-driven), or grey-box (hybrid) [50, 46]. Our dataset and benchmark experiment, which automate timeseries data classification, help address this challenge by reducing the time and cost associated with building key components of these models.\\n\\nIn comparison to building models, there has been a significant focus on optimising building control operations and transitioning from conventional rule-based approaches to model predictive control or data-driven methods [50]. The Building Optimization Framework or BOPTEST [11] exists to enable the development and benchmarking of building control strategies. The performance of a control strategy or algorithm is evaluated on a virtual \\\"test case\\\". Currently, these test cases are simulation physics-based models of ideal buildings developed on Spawn [83] (a co-simulation of Modelica and EnergyPlus) and act as emulators. In their paper, Blum et al. [11] make the contrasting argument that simulation-based test cases offer advantages over existing challenges when testing in real buildings, such as being time-consuming and subject to stochastic events.\\n\\nHowever, accessing publicly available and anonymized building timeseries data from various non-residential building types acts as a commodity to reduce the time to develop individual hybrid building models. On one hand, using data from real buildings can be used to calibrate and interpolate lesser-known parameters, while maintaining moderate interpretability. And on the other hand, using standardized timeseries data such as the datasets introduced here aids in scalability and deployability to build generalized multi-zone environments and substituting with data from another building system or zone.\\n\\nMore broadly, there are various other applications of this dataset. **Generative AI for Privacy-Preserving Data Sharing**: Explore the use of generative AI to create synthetic building timeseries data, enabling building owners to contribute data for research while safeguarding sensitive information. **LLM Integration for Natural Language Interaction**: Investigate methods to integrate LLMs with building timeseries data, allowing various stakeholders such as building operators to interact with and query the data using natural language. **Redeployability**: By using a standardised ontology to describe the building, and linking timeseries data to the building model, applications (e.g. measurement and verification, chiller scheduling, occupant comfort) can be written to deploy against a fleet of buildings without a deep understanding of the building topology, such as those provided within this dataset.\\n\\n### 2.3 Relevant Challenges in Machine Learning (ML) Research\\n\\n**Domain shift and domain adaptation.** In the realm of ML research, one challenge is in domain adaptation, particularly about the diverse characteristics of buildings. These variations encompass factors such as climate, usage, size, regulations, budget, and architecture, resulting in notable distribution shifts. Consequently, traditional ML methodologies fall short in address these discrepancies. Therefore, the development and implementation of domain adaptation techniques [4, 3, 73, 26] are crucial to ensure model generalization across different buildings. Additionally, the usual alternative of employing large foundational models [94] is impractical because privacy and security concerns limit the availability of extensive building datasets for training. Moreover, as shown in Section 3.3.2 the unique permutation of ontologies in each building further complicates the scenario, necessitating novel approaches capable of handling arbitrary permutations effectively [45]. This is an issue since many timeseries architecture do not allow the model to input and output an arbitrary number of variate [86].\\n\\n**Multimodal Learning with knowledge graphs (KG) and unbalanced multivariate timeseries (MVTS) with long tails.** While many studies focus on MVTS data in conjunction with spatial graph [62, 63], video, image, audio, and text data [15, 89], research on MVTS with knowledge graphs is scarce. Our dataset enable such research as it contains the Brick schema which is a KG on building metadata, describing relationship between the timeseries in the MVTS. Our dataset is also challenging because it is unbalanced and featuring distributions long tails. As shown in Section 3.3.2 some classes, like Chilled Water Differential Temperature Sensor, might only have one or two instances in the entire dataset, or, like Alarm, have zero values for most of the time. These challenges could fuel the developments of innovative techniques.\"}"]}

A semantic model of the building was created using DCH platform tooling. This created Brick schema [7] class definitions (version 1.2.1) for points within the model, and linked these points to the timeseries data ingested via MQTTS.\\n\\nAll instrumentation was conducted prior to the study, and as such no equipment installation or hardware setup was required by the authors. The work integrates with DCH platform which provides digital infrastructure to house building data, as well as to generate semantic models to describe the topology and instrumentation installed within the building. Based on a previously conducted systemic evaluation of existing ontologies suitable for our research context, we chose the Brick schema [66]. In terms of effort to map to the Brick schema, once sufficient details about the building are compiled, then typically expert engineers requires at least one to two days of per building to generate a full semantic building model.\\n\\nIdentifiers for both the point within the model, and the timeseries identifier were anonymised by generating Universally Unique Identifiers (UUID), and a three-year-period subset of the timeseries data was extracted from the DCH platform to produce this dataset.

The actual time series data is typically stored in a separate database.\\n\\n**Edges (E):** Each edge $e = (u, p, v) \\\\in E$ represents a predicate $p$ between two vertices $u$ and $v$.\\n\\n**Predicate (P):** Each edge $e$ is associated with a predicate $p \\\\in P$ that specifies the type of relationship it represents (e.g., hasPart, has Location, or isPointOf).\\n\\n#### 3.3.1 BTS and LBNL59\\n\\n**BTS complements LBNL59** due to differences in time and location, as well as the size and complexity of the buildings.

Although LBNL59 contains 337 different timeseries, they are composed of only 11 different classes, all classified as either Sensor or Setpoint. In contrast, the BTS dataset has hundreds of unique Point classes including additional categories such as Alarm, Command, Parameter, and Status, offering a more comprehensive and varied dataset.\\n\\n### 3.3.2 Addressing Literature Gaps with BTS Dataset\\n\\nIn Sections 2.2 and 2.3 the importance of scalability and interoperability was underscored, alongside the notable properties exhibited by our datasets, including domain shift, multimodality, imbalance, and long-tailedness. Here, we elaborate on how the BTS dataset effectively addresses these identified gaps in the literature.\\n\\n**Brick is machine-readable and multimodal.** Consequently, this dataset fuels the research into building-agnostic, interoperable, and scalable software and ML models for building analytics. As a KG, Brick includes text components, facilitating novel research into interactions between KG, LLM and MVTS data.\\n\\n**Our dataset is from real-world buildings.** This inclusion highlights real-world issues, as illustrated in Figure 1. For instance, the anomalously straight segments in Air Temp Sensor, Outside Air Temp Sensor, and Enable Status during the middle of May might indicate that there are missing values. Additionally, at the end of June, an anomalous data point is observed where the temperature sensors and setpoint limits drop to zero at the same time. It remains unclear if this was intentional, or by accident, or an error. This dataset serves as a test bed to evaluate how ML pipelines can address such issues during inference.\\n\\n**Domain Shift.** The presence of domain shift complicates transfer learning efforts, as each building exhibits a unique distribution of classes. For instance, in the BTS_A, over half of the timeseries are sensors, whereas in BTS_B, this proportion drops to less than a third. Similarly, approximately a third of timeseries in BTS_B are setpoints, compared to less than a tenth in BTS_A.\\n\\nMoreover, individual timeseries within each building demonstrate distinct distributions. As depicted in Figure 1, Outside Air Temp Sensor exhibit periodic behavior, leading to a more normal distribution, while Electrical Power Sensor display a non-periodic, monotonically increasing\"}"]}

Moreover, as shown in the figures in Appendix B, there is a significant disjoint of ontological classes between buildings; more than half of the classes only appear in one of the buildings only. Therefore, our dataset serves as an ideal dataset for investigating domain shifts.\\n\\n**Long-Tailed Distributions.** The class distribution in BTS exhibits a long tail as shown in the figures in Appendix B. This means that certain class appear frequently, such as the 1004 instances of Electrical Power Sensor across all three buildings (Figure 4), while others are rare, with 10 classes appearing only once in the entire dataset, such as the Air Differential Pressure Setpoint location in BTS_C (Figure 7). Similarly, the values in some timeseries also follow a long-tailed distribution. For example, Alarms are expected to remain at zero most of the time.\\n\\n## 4 Benchmark\\n\\n![Figure 3: Visualisation of the multi-label timeseries classification task.](image)\\n\\nTo demonstrate the utility of this dataset, we conducted a benchmark on the multi-label timeseries classification task.

We also performed an additional benchmark on a zero-shot forecasting task. The details can be found in Appendix D.\\n\\nBrick schema [7] was developed to aids in data interoperability across buildings. However, constructing the Brick schema for each building requires expensive and error prone manual expert labor to classifying timeseries data into the correct Brick classes. Past studies [8, 43, 67] have attempted to automate this process with ML relied on private data and did not release their code. This benchmark is the first to address the task using publicly available data. We formulated this task as a multi-label timeseries classification task, where a label will also return true for all super-classes and return as zero for all subclass.

Notice how naive methods achieved very high accuracy but very poor F1 and mean Average Precision (mAP) scores, while deep learning methods obtained slightly better F1 and mAP scores but much poor accuracy. We attribute this to the extreme imbalance in our dataset. All models performed only slightly better than the naive methods, indicating that this is an unsolved problem with significant potential for new discoveries.\\n\\nRefer to Appendix C for more details about this experiment, including formal problem formulation, more results and other experimental details.\\n\\n### 5 Limitations\\n\\nFirstly, the dataset is sourced from only three non-residential buildings in Australia, limiting its geographical diversity. Consequently, models trained on this dataset may not generalize well to residential buildings, or buildings in other regions with different climates, regulations, and building practices. This limitation implies that models should primarily be used for research purposes rather than direct deployment.\\n\\nSecondly, the anonymization process, essential for privacy, may have removed valuable context-specific information, such as building layouts, occupancy patterns, and operational schedules. This reduction in detail could limit the dataset\u2019s applicability for certain analyses. Moreover, despite thorough anonymization efforts, there is no absolute guarantee that personally identifiable information cannot be recovered, particularly when correlated with external datasets.\\n\\nFinally, as this paper focuses on the dataset rather than benchmarking, the depth of the benchmarks is limited. For example, hyperparameter optimization was not performed.\\n\\n### 6 Conclusion\\n\\nIn this paper, we introduced the Building TimeSeries (BTS) dataset, addressing the critical gaps in building analytics research by providing a comprehensive, publicly available dataset that spans three buildings over three years, encompassing over ten thousand timeseries data points and 240\"}"]}

This dataset is standardized using the Brick schema, ensuring interoperability and consistency across analyses. Additionally, our datasets inherently possess properties of interest to machine learning research, such as domain shift, multimodality, imbalance, and long-tailedness. Our benchmarks on multi-label timeseries classification and zero-shot forecasting tasks demonstrate the dataset\u2019s utility in addressing key challenges in building analytics. By making the BTS dataset and our benchmarking code publicly accessible, we aim to facilitate further research in optimizing building performance, ultimately contributing to efforts to mitigate climate change and enhance human well-being.\\n\\nAcknowledgments and Disclosure of Funding\\n\\nThis research is supported by the NSW Government through the CSIRO\u2019s NSW Digital Infrastructure Energy Flexibility (DIEF) project, funded under the Net Zero Plan Stage 1: 2020-2030.\\n\\nThis project is also funded by the Reliable Affordable Clean Energy for 2030 (RACE for 2030) Cooperative Research Centre.\\n\\nThis research was undertaken with the assistance of resources from the National Computational Infrastructure (NCI Australia), an NCRIS enabled capability supported by the Australian Government.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\n[1] U.

The reason is to enable analysis of accuracy against various length of the timeseries. Those with too few datapoint, less than 1 per day, are removed.

In practical applications, it is crucial for well-trained models to be applicable across diverse building scenarios without retraining costs. However, specific building constraints, operational variances, functionality differences, and data heterogeneity pose significant challenges in real-world settings. As shown in Table 2, models must adapt to dynamic ontology changes when applied to different buildings. Previous studies often rely on identical features and well-processed data, not reflecting the complexity of real-world scenarios. LBNL59, involving only one building, is insufficient for transfer learning studies. This study establishes a baseline for zero-shot forecasting using the BTS multivariate time series.\\n\\nD.1 Problem Formulation\\n\\nSuppose we have dataset $D \\\\in \\\\mathcal{R}^{N \\\\times K}$ with $N$ IoT points and $K$ timesteps. Each data point is denoted as $d_{N,k} = D_{N,k:k+S}$, where $S$ is the sequence length of the historical data. Denote the forecasting model as $h(\\\\cdot)$. The multi-step forecasting problem is formalized as follows: $h(d_{N,k}) = d_{N,k+S+H}$, where $H$ is the forecasting horizon. In zero-shot forecasting, the model is trained and tested across different datasets. In this study, $S = 12, H = 12$.\\n\\nD.2 Data Pre-processing\\n\\nThis study utilizes a 1-month training dataset spanning from 00:00:00 on 01/07/2022 to 00:00:00 on 01/08/2022, with irregular data resampled to a 10-minute granularity and then standardization. The historical window and forecast horizon are set to 12 time steps, equivalent to 2 hours. A model trained on one dataset is evaluated across all buildings for the same period. For each dataset, a subset of IoT points is selected for training based on the criterion $N_{\\\\text{unique}}/N_{\\\\text{sample}} > \\\\eta$ where $\\\\eta = 0.1$. This feature selection results in 133, 710, and 2025 IoT points for the three respective datasets.\"}"]}

Models are fed by all the IoT points data and expect to forecast the corresponding values of these IoT points. Considering that certain Transformer-based backbone models that involve a conventional embedding layer, such as iTransformer, Informer, and PatchTST, do not support changes in input channels between training and testing sets, we handle the task as an univariate forecasting problem, treating each IoT point equivalently. Similar to the multi-label classification task, the code is modified based on TSLib[88] Github repository. The training process employs the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.01 and Mean Square Error (MSE) loss, and a learning rate scheduler is applied. Training is capped at 20 epochs with an early stopping patience of 3 epochs. All experiments are conducted on the NCI Gadi server utilizing 4 V100 GPUs.\\n\\nD.5 Metrics\\n\\nBaseline performance is evaluated using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error (SMAPE) averaged by IoT points. Following the above-mentioned notation, the mathematical definitions are as follows:\\n\\n\\\\[\\nMAE = \\\\frac{1}{N} \\\\sum_{n=1}^{N} |\\\\hat{y}_n - y_n|\\n\\\\]\\n\\n\\\\[\\nSMAPE = \\\\frac{100\\\\%}{N} \\\\sum_{n=1}^{N} \\\\frac{|\\\\hat{y}_n - y_n|}{|\\\\hat{y}_n| + |y_n|}\\n\\\\]\\n\\n\\\\[\\nR^2 = 1 - \\\\frac{\\\\sum_{n=1}^{N} (y_n - \\\\hat{y}_n)^2}{\\\\sum_{n=1}^{N} (y_n - \\\\bar{y})^2}\\n\\\\]\\n\\nwhere \\\\(\\\\hat{y}_n, y_n, \\\\bar{y}_n\\\\) are the multi-step prediction, ground truth, and mean for the evaluated model.\\n\\nD.6 Main Results\\n\\nTable 5 presents the Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error (SMAPE) and \\\\(R^2\\\\) scores for four baseline models in this task, with diagonal values omitted. PatchTST and DLinear consistently outperform the other models, balancing higher \\\\(R^2\\\\) scores with lower SMAPE values.

This can be attributed to the greater complexity of BTS_A compared to BTS_B and BTS_C. BTS_A includes more heterogeneous series and entity types (BTS_A has 42 entities, where BTS_B and BTS_C have 16 and 31 entities respectively in the task training data), which introduces additional noise that impacts accuracy.\\n\\nThe evaluation metrics, MAE and SMAPE, indicate that PatchTST outperforms other baselines, while $R^2$ scores suggest that DLinear is superior. However, DLinear also shows a higher standard deviation. This indicates that DLinear effectively captures linearity in sequential data, leading to accurate predictions for IoT points with strong linear relationships. Conversely, it struggles with complex inherent dependencies, resulting in poorer performance on datasets with such characteristics.\\n\\nThe overall scores indicate significant potential for improvement. Considering the comprehensive metadata scope provided by the BTS dataset, future work can leverage knowledge graphs to enhance data modality. This approach could improve the accuracy and robustness of deep learning models in zero-shot forecasting.\"}"]}
