The latest goal is disentanglement: the construction of multiple estimators that are each tailored to one and only one source of uncertainty. This paper presents the first benchmark of uncertainty disentanglement. We reimplement and evaluate a comprehensive range of uncertainty estimators, from Bayesian over evidential to deterministic ones, across a diverse range of uncertainty tasks on ImageNet. We find that, despite recent theoretical endeavors, no existing approach provides pairs of disentangled uncertainty estimators in practice. We further find that specialized uncertainty tasks are harder than predictive uncertainty tasks, where we observe saturating performance. Our results provide both practical advice for which uncertainty estimators to use for which specific task, and reveal opportunities for future research toward task-centric and disentangled uncertainties. All our reimplementations and Weights & Biases logs are available at https://github.com/bmucsanyi/untangle.\\n\\n1 Introduction\\n\\nWhen uncertainty quantification methods were first pioneered for deep learning [12, 29], their task was simple: giving one total uncertainty estimate. The recent demand for trustworthy machine learning [36] created new requirements, mostly centering around disentangling the above predictive uncertainty into aleatoric (data-inherent and irreducible) and epistemic (model-centric and reducible) components [11, 52, 47]. Such disentangled estimators are needed for multiple modern applications: Out-of-distribution detection needs to filter unseen samples with high epistemic uncertainty without being confounded with seen samples with high aleatoric uncertainty [37], and active learning uses individual aleatoric and epistemic estimates to select the most efficient samples to learn from [28, 35].\\n\\nHowever, recent advances towards such disentangled uncertainties are primarily theoretical and supported by only small-scale experiments [47, 53, 37]. Conversely, larger-scale benchmarks evaluate methods w.r.t. only one uncertainty component and do not test for undesirable side effects on other components [13, 40]. There is currently no study that evaluates which component(s) each method captures in practice and which it does not \u2013 which is often contrary to their original intuition.\\n\\nOur work provides a comprehensive benchmark of the vast recent landscape of uncertainty methods and tasks. We reimplement nineteen uncertainty quantification methods in up to fourteen ways and evaluate each on thirteen practically defined tasks on ImageNet-1k [10] and CIFAR-10 [27]. This includes recent information-theoretical and Bregman decomposition formulas that intend to disentangle total uncertainties into aleatoric and epistemic components [57, 42, 11]. We reveal that none of the existing approaches achieve disentanglement in practice. Most proposed pairs of estimators are highly internally correlated (rank corr. \u2265 0.78) and fail to unmix aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty (Section 3.1). We also find that specialized tasks (Sections 3.2 and 3.3) are harder to solve\"}"]}

We anticipate that our quantitative insights will drive the field toward developing more disentangled and specialized uncertainty estimators.\\n\\n2 Benchmarked Methods\\n\\nThis section provides an overview of the benchmarked uncertainty estimators and disentanglement formulas. We reimplement all nineteen methods and explain implementation details in Appendix A.\\n\\n2.1 Uncertainty Quantification Methods\\n\\nWe consider a classification setting with a discrete label space of $C$ classes. On top of the eight supervised uncertainty quantification methods from Kirchhof et al. [25], we reimplement another eleven methods to encourage diversity and general applicability of our findings. Below, we categorize the benchmarked approaches into distributional and deterministic methods.\\n\\n2.1.1 Distributional methods\\n\\nDistributional methods model a second-order predictive distribution $q(\\\\pi \\\\mid x)$ over class probability vectors $\\\\pi \\\\in \\\\Delta^{C-1}$ for an input $x \\\\in \\\\mathcal{X}$. For example, $q(\\\\pi \\\\mid x)$ can correspond to a Bayesian posterior on the simplex, $p(\\\\pi \\\\mid x, D)$, induced by a weight-space posterior $p(\\\\theta \\\\mid D) \\\\propto p(D \\\\mid \\\\theta) p(\\\\theta)$ when training on dataset $D$.\\n\\nSpectral-Normalized Gaussian Processes (SNGP) [32] represent the $q(\\\\pi \\\\mid x)$ distributions by approximating a Gaussian process (GP) over the classifier output, aided by spectral normalization. We also benchmark the last-layer GP without spectral normalization. The last-layer Laplace Approximation [8] and Stochastic Weight Averaging \u2013 Gaussian (SWAG) [34] both model a Gaussian parameter distribution in a post-hoc fashion that induces the $q(\\\\pi \\\\mid x)$ distributions. The Laplace approximation does so by fitting the parameter-space Gaussian w.r.t. the local curvature around the MAP estimate, whereas SWAG samples model weights via checkpointing and fits an empirical distribution. Similarly, Heteroscedastic Classifiers (HET) [5] and Latent Heteroscedastic Classifiers (HET-XL) [6] predict a heteroscedastic Gaussian distribution over the logits and pre-logit embeddings, respectively.

Following Ulmer et al. [50], we refer to the method of Sensoy et al. [45] as **Evidential Deep Learning (EDL)** and that of Charpentier et al. [4] as the **Posterior Network (PostNet)**.\\n\\n**MC Dropout** [12, 48] and **Deep Ensemble** [29] do not construct second-order predictive distributions \\\\( q(\\\\pi \\\\mid x) \\\\) explicitly. Instead, they sample from them by \\\\( M \\\\) repeated forward passes with randomly switched off activations or by training \\\\( M \\\\) models, respectively. The **Heteroscedastic Classification Neural Network (HetClassNN)** [23] uses the uncertainties from MC Dropout for epistemic uncertainty and models an input-conditional heteroscedastic logit variance for aleatoric uncertainty. The **Shallow Ensemble** [31] is a lightweight approximation of the Deep Ensemble with a shared backbone and \\\\( M \\\\) output heads.\\n\\nPractical tasks like threshold-based rejection often need a scalar uncertainty value \\\\( u(x) \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R} \\\\) instead of a second-order predictive distribution \\\\( q(\\\\pi \\\\mid x) \\\\). To this end, **uncertainty aggregators** compile the above distributions into scalar uncertainty estimates. Several methods exist for this aggregation, such as calculating the Bayesian Model Average (BMA) \\\\( \\\\bar{\\\\pi}(x) := \\\\mathbb{E}_{q(\\\\pi \\\\mid x)}[\\\\pi] \\\\) and using its entropy as the uncertainty estimate \\\\( u(x) \\\\) or quantifying the variance of \\\\( q(\\\\pi \\\\mid x) \\\\), as often seen in ensembles. While many distributional methods are proposed with a specific aggregator, we show in Appendix D.5 that they do not always behave as expected and limit performance. To remove this confounder, we consider fourteen aggregators (Appendix D) for distributional methods and use the best-performing one.\\n\\n### 2.1.2 Deterministic Methods\\n\\nDeterministic methods [43] directly output scalar uncertainty estimates \\\\( u(x) \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R} \\\\) instead of modeling a second-order predictive distribution \\\\( q(\\\\pi \\\\mid x) \\\\) over class probability vectors.\\n\\n**Loss Prediction** [59, 28, 25] employs an additional MLP head for \\\\( u(x) \\\\) that estimates the loss of the network\u2019s prediction \\\\( \\\\pi(x) \\\\in \\\\Delta^{C-1} \\\\), reflecting a notion of (in-)correctness. **Correctness Prediction** is a special variant for classification where \\\\( u(x) \\\\) predicts how likely the predicted class \\\\( \\\\hat{y} := \\\\arg \\\\max_{c \\\\in \\\\{1, \\\\ldots, C\\\\}} \\\\pi_c(x) \\\\) is to be the correct class \\\\( y \\\\), i.e., \\\\( p(\\\\hat{y} = y \\\\mid x) \\\\).\\n\\n**Deterministic Uncertainty Quantification (DUQ)** [53] learns a latent mixture-of-RBF density on the training dataset and outputs as \\\\( u(x) \\\\) how close an input\u2019s embedding is to the mixture means. The **Mahalanobis** method [30] builds a similar latent mixture of Gaussians in a post-hoc fashion. It also perturbs the inputs adversarially to separate in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) samples. The **Deep Deterministic Uncertainty (DDU)** method [37] combines the spectral normalization of SNGPs with the latent density of the Mahalanobis method. **Temperature Scaling** [18] post-hoc calibrates the predicted probability vectors with a temperature scalar.\\\\(^1\\\\) As a **Baseline**, we use a deterministic single-point network trained with the cross-entropy loss.\\n\\n### 2.2 Uncertainty Decomposition Formulas\\n\\nSo far, we only considered uncertainty estimators that (sometimes after aggregating) output a single estimate \\\\( u(x) \\\\). A second strain of literature outputs not only one estimate but decomposes the \\\\( q(\\\\pi \\\\mid x) \\\\) of distributional methods into multiple estimators that each intend to quantify one source of uncertainty, such as epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty [22, 36]. We benchmark two prominent approaches to obtain such pairs of estimators: the **information-theoretical (IT)** [11, 37, 57] and the **Bregman** decomposition [42, 19, 17]. In the main paper, we focus on the IT decomposition due to its widespread use. The definition and results of the Bregman decomposition are shown in Appendix B.\\n\\nThe IT decomposition decomposes the entropy of the predictive distribution \\\\( p(y \\\\mid \\\\pi, x) = \\\\int p(y \\\\mid \\\\pi, x) \\\\, dq(\\\\pi \\\\mid x) \\\\) into an aleatoric and an epistemic component:\\n\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\underbrace{\\\\mathbb{H}_{p(y \\\\mid x)}(y)}_{\\\\text{predictive}} = \\\\mathbb{E}_{q(\\\\pi \\\\mid x)} \\\\left[ \\\\underbrace{\\\\mathbb{H}_{p(y \\\\mid \\\\pi, x)}(y)}_{\\\\text{aleatoric}} \\\\right] + \\\\underbrace{\\\\mathbb{I}_{p(y, \\\\pi \\\\mid x)}(y; \\\\pi)}_{\\\\text{epistemic}},\\n\\\\]\\n\\nwhere \\\\( p(y \\\\mid \\\\pi, x) = \\\\text{Cat}(y; \\\\pi) = \\\\pi_y, p(y, \\\\pi \\\\mid x) = p(y \\\\mid \\\\pi, x)q(\\\\pi \\\\mid x), \\\\mathbb{H}_{p(y \\\\mid x)}(y) \\\\) is the entropy, and \\\\( \\\\mathbb{I}_{p(y, \\\\pi \\\\mid x)}(y; \\\\pi) \\\\) is the mutual information.

For evidential deep learning methods with Dirichlet $q(\\\\pi \\\\mid x)$ distributions, closed-form expressions exist for each term of Eq. (1), whereas other approaches require Monte Carlo approximations [50].\\n\\nThe key goal behind these decompositions is **uncertainty disentanglement**: The aleatoric component should capture aleatoric and only aleatoric uncertainty, and the epistemic estimator should reflect epistemic and only epistemic uncertainty. In particular, this entails that both components need to be sufficiently uncorrelated. See Appendix E for more details and a formal definition.\\n\\n## 3 Experiments\\n\\nWe now investigate our main research question: Does any approach give disentangled uncertainty estimators (Section 3.1)? Then, we go into each individual type of uncertainty and investigate which estimator practically performs the best on epistemic (Section 3.2), aleatoric (Section 3.3), and predictive uncertainty tasks (Section 3.4). Lastly, we draw conclusions across all tasks (Section 3.5) and benchmark the robustness of current uncertainty estimators (Section 3.6).\\n\\nTo provide even grounds, we reimplement each method and provide it as an easy-to-use uncertainty wrapper that can be added to arbitrary timm [56] models. In this paper, we use pretrained ResNet-50 backbones and train each approach for 50 ImageNet-1k [10] epochs with a training pipeline following Tran et al. [49]. The CE baseline converges to an accuracy of 0.785 with this strategy. Since the DUQ method has memory and stability issues on ImageNet, in Section 3.7, we repeat all experiments on CIFAR-10 [27] with the WideResNet 28-10 architecture, following Liu et al. [32]. We only report the other 18 methods on ImageNet. We search for ideal hyperparameters and an early stopping checkpoint for each method by tracking the validation performance. We then run the best hyperparameters across five seeds and report mean, minimum, and maximum test performance. This overall takes 1.5 GPU years on RTX 2080 Ti GPUs. We report the main results in the paper and go into more detail for, e.g., different uncertainty aggregators in the appendix. We also publish all of these metrics and their logs.\\n\\n### 3.1 Decomposition Formulas Fail to Disentangle Aleatoric and Epistemic Uncertainty\\n\\nWe first study if decomposition formulas, IT or Bregman, yield disentangled estimators. Since they decompose second-order predictive distributions $q(\\\\pi \\\\mid x)$, we analyze distributional methods and no deterministic methods in this section.\\n\\nFig. 1 reveals a simple failure: The decomposed aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty estimates are strongly correlated, being high or low iff the other component is high or low. These severe internal correlations prohibit the estimators from capturing semantically different sources of uncertainty and hinder applications that require unconfounded uncertainty estimates, such as active learning.\\n\\n---\\n\\n2 https://github.com/bmucsanyi/untangle\\n3 https://wandb.ai/bmucsanyi/untangle\"}"]}

Figure 2a shows that aleatoric and epistemic estimates obtained via the IT decomposition are highly rank correlated (rank corr. $\\\\in [0.78, 0.99]$) for all distributional methods that we benchmark. This holds similarly on CIFAR-10 (Figure 2b), as well as for the Bregman decomposition (Appendix B) and also does not considerably lower when we artificially add more epistemic uncertainty into the dataset, see Appendix C.2. Often, the components are even linearly correlated; see the Pearson correlation results in Appendix C.4.\\n\\nA part of these correlations is inevitable: On ImageNet, regions with aleatorically uncertain images are undersampled compared to regions without aleatoric uncertainty and thus also more epistemically uncertain (see Fig. J.3). This means that ImageNet has a level of inevitable correlation between epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty estimates. We quantify this inevitable correlation via the rank correlation between the GT aleatoric uncertainty (i.e., the entropy of the GT label distribution) and the models\u2019 epistemic uncertainty given by the Bregman decomposition in Appendix B.4. This gives levels of inevitable correlation for the Bregman decomposition that are at most 0.45. Further, we show in Section 3.3 that there are pairs of uncertainty estimators where one performs well on aleatoric and the other on epistemic uncertainty, with a notably low rank correlation of $0.15 \\\\pm 0.01$. Thus, the severe correlations exceeding 0.78 are shortcomings of the decomposition formulas and not inherent properties of the ImageNet dataset.\\n\\nIn conclusion, decomposition formulas of various forms applied to various second-order distributions produce uncertainty estimators that are so highly correlated that they hardly capture the different individual notions of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty that they are intended to capture.\\n\\n### 3.2 Epistemic Uncertainty: Specialized Uncertainty Estimators Detect OOD Inputs the Best\\n\\nIf decomposition formulas cannot yield epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty estimates, which methods can? For the rest of the paper, we widen the scope and include not only the aleatoric and epistemic estimators defined by the decomposition formulas but also arbitrary aggregators of second-order distributions, as well as deterministic methods. This section tests which of these estimators represents epistemic uncertainty, measured by an out-of-distribution (OOD) detection task [17, 37]. We create a 50/50 dataset of in-distribution (ID) and OOD samples, with ID samples getting class 0 and OOD samples getting class 1. We quantify via a binary classification AUROC if uncertainty estimates are higher on OOD samples than on ID samples. We use ImageNet-C [21] with all of its corruptions of severity level two as OOD data. The severity level two is far enough out-of-distribution to deteriorate the ImageNet accuracy by 27% (Section 3.6).\\n\\nFig. 3a shows that the methods differ greatly in their ability to detect OOD samples and, thus, in their alignment with epistemic uncertainty. The Mahalanobis method performs best. This is likely because it is the only method trained specifically for OOD detection with ImageNet-C corruptions of severity level two. A method with a similar latent density intuition and distance-awareness induced by spectral normalization, DDU, is the worst at telling ID and OOD samples apart (AUROC = 0.675). Additionally, the best-performing aggregators for the second-order distributions, the performance of which Fig. 3a shows, are often not the disagreement-based aggregators that decomposition formulas propose for epistemic uncertainty tasks (Appendix D.5).

We now evaluate how well the benchmarked models predict aleatoric uncertainty. We follow Tran et al. [49] and Kirchhof et al. [24, 25] and use the disagreement of human annotators as ground truths for aleatoric uncertainty. ImageNet-ReaL [2] (and CIFAR-10H [41]) queries multiple annotators for labels on each image. We showcase some examples in Appendix J. We use the entropy of the soft-label distributions per image as GT aleatoric uncertainties. We then calculate the rank correlation between the methods\u2019 uncertainty estimates and the GT label entropies across all images. We do not use an AUROC here because the GT values are continuous, but provide binarized AUROCs for direct comparability of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty performance results in Appendix H.4.\\n\\nFig. 3b shows that almost all methods lie within a correlation of $[0, 0.37, 0.46]$. Note that the best achievable rank correlation is not one since the GT aleatoric data contains ties. While it is unknown how high the best achievable rank correlation is, the fact that there are consistent improvements across the methods hints at the fact that further performance gains are far from saturated. The method that sticks out on the low end of the spectrum is Mahalanobis, which is uncorrelated with the GT aleatoric uncertainty. This is, in fact, a strength: Mahalanobis estimates reflect epistemic uncertainty while being non-informative of aleatoric uncertainty. Combining this with a second estimator for aleatoric uncertainty can pave the way for a pair of disentangled uncertainty estimators. As a simple start, combining it with the CE baseline achieves a low rank correlation of $0.15 \\\\pm 0.01$ between the two. We see this as a promising pathway to disentangled uncertainty estimators in the future.\\n\\nWith the aleatoric and epistemic tasks introduced, we can take a final look at the epistemic and aleatoric estimators proposed by the IT decomposition. In Appendix C.3, using them instead of the best ones reduces Shallow Ensemble\u2019s performance, which was the best distributional method on OOD detection, to the CE baseline level. It again shows that the theoretically intuitive estimators underperform in practice.\\n\\n### 3.4 Predictive Uncertainty: The Best Method Depends on the Precise Task\\n\\nLet us now broaden the view beyond disentanglement to benchmark how well uncertainty estimators solve other practically relevant tasks. We start with correctness prediction, where the AUROC quantifies whether wrong predictions generally have higher uncertainties than correct predictions.\\n\\nFig. 4a shows that most uncertainty estimators perform within $\\\\pm 0.014$ of the cross-entropy baseline when predicting correctness. Modern methods like HET-XL do not outperform older methods like the Deep Ensemble or MC Dropout. Evidential deep learning methods, like EDL and PostNet, are an exception to this. They are considerably better at predicting correctness. This also holds when mixing the datasets with OOD data in Appendix H.1. However, their better performance comes at a cost.

When demanding similar classification accuracies, we find that they lose their advantage.\\n\\nA related task to correctness prediction is abstained prediction. It involves refusing to predict on the $x\\\\%$ most uncertain examples and calculating the model\u2019s accuracy on the remaining samples. We use the Accuracy-Coverage (AC) curve [15] that plots increasing fractions of abstained samples from 0% to 100% on the $x$-axis against the accuracy on the non-abstained portion. Following the conventions of Galil et al. [14], we denote this metric as the area under the accuracy coverage curve (AUAC). In Appendix H.5, we also evaluate methods on the rAULC and E-AURC metrics that normalize the AUAC by the accuracy of the underlying model [43, 14].\\n\\nFig. 4b shows that this predictive uncertainty task is saturated. All uncertainty methods apart from Mahalanobis obtain an AUAC score greater than 0.91, and only a few outperform the CE baseline. Since the AUAC depends on accuracy, EDL and PostNet perform worse in this metric, although both AUROC and AUAC target predictive uncertainty. This demonstrates that practitioners need to carefully specify an uncertainty estimator\u2019s overall goal. Designing a system that can detect errors is not the same as designing a system that reduces errors.\\n\\nThe same holds for calibration. While this is also a predictive uncertainty task, the goal is slightly different. It is not to provide a good ranking of uncertain images but to give correctness probabilities that are close to the true frequentist probabilities.\\n\\nFig. 5 shows that different methods excel at this task than at the AUROC correctness task (Fig. 4a). In particular, Laplace and temperature scaling, which were only as good as the CE baseline in terms of AUROC, show drastically improved performance in terms of the ECE. Note that these two use a validation dataset to become better calibrated, similar to how Mahalanobis specialized and outperformed on the epistemic uncertainty task.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the predictive uncertainty results show that the exact definition of the task one intends to solve with uncertainty estimators matters because different estimators specialize in different notions of uncertainty.\\n\\n### 3.5 Different Tasks Require Different Methods\\n\\nThe previous sections suggest that uncertainty tasks are not all solved by the same best method. In this section, we investigate how the performance of methods on different tasks is correlated. In particular, we use the previous practical tasks along with further popular metrics and measure the between-task Pearson correlations of the performance of all benchmarked methods. The correlations of the rankings of the methods are similar; see Appendix H.7.\\n\\nFig. 6 shows barely any recognizable clusters, except that AUAC is confounded by accuracy. While all other metrics, except OOD AUROC, correlate to some extent, their correlation is not perfect, once again demonstrating that the performances of the uncertainty estimators depend on the exact task. These findings further corroborate that there is no one-fits-all uncertainty estimator, but there are multiple tasks with nuanced differences to which an uncertainty estimator can be tailored.\\n\\n![Figure 5: Expected calibration error on ImageNet.](image)\\n\\n![Figure 6: The Pearson correlation of metric pairs across methods and aggregators on the ImageNet validation dataset is only medium.

The AUAC performance degrades together with accuracy, which is a fundamental property of the metric itself since the area under the accuracy is lower-bounded by the baseline accuracy. The AUAC gain (i.e., AUAC \u2013 Accuracy) increases with the perturbation severity, showing that the uncertainty estimators even become relatively better on the abstinence task as the severity increases.

Appendix G repeats all experiments on CIFAR-10, which is widely used in the uncertainty quantification literature [53, 37, 17]. While some conclusions from CIFAR-10 experiments replicate on ImageNet, like the correlated aleatoric and epistemic estimators, the larger-scale ImageNet often shows different behavior.\\n\\n**Robustness.** Uncertainty estimates are far less robust on CIFAR-10 than on the ImageNet scale, even though the drop in classification accuracy is very similar. Unlike on ImageNet, where the uncertainty estimators maintain a close to constant performance in predicting correctness as we go OOD (Fig. 7a), on CIFAR-10, correctness estimators deteriorate together with the model\u2019s accuracy (Fig. 7b). The same holds for the ECE (Fig. 8a vs. Fig. 8b).

The disentanglement is usually analyzed theoretically [57, 1, 16] or with qualitative plots (Kirchhof et al. [26], Fig. 6-9; Mukhoti et al. [37], Fig. 2; Valdenegro-Toro and Mori [52], Fig. 8-10). Our results support this discussion with a practical and quantitative perspective. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to quantify the uncertainty disentanglement. We find that no tested decomposition formula works for any tested second-order distribution, neither on ImageNet-1k nor CIFAR-10. Our findings encourage combining separate methods instead, such as the CE baseline\u2019s predictive entropy and the Mahalanobis values, where each method handles a specific type of uncertainty. This is similar to the recent work of Mukhoti et al. [37]. We expect that our quantitative benchmarking methods help develop this field further.\\n\\n**Robustness.** Recent benchmarks on OOD detection and robustness [38, 40, 43, 13] have first highlighted robustness issues of uncertainty estimates. Our benchmark supports these findings on CIFAR-10, especially in the region that is slightly OOD yet already causes degradation of both the main task and the uncertainty estimator. The latter implies that uncertainty estimators either need to become more robust to distribution shifts [25] or be better able to detect subtle epistemic uncertainties. However, our experiments on ImageNet do not show robustness issues. It is possible that the vast space of natural images that the ImageNet training dataset covers resolves this issue. We encourage repeating our experiments and testing the uncertainty estimation not just on test data but also on perturbed test data for future large-scale uncertainty estimators.\\n\\n**Aleatoric uncertainty.** While epistemic uncertainty is widely evaluated on the OOD detection proxy task [37, 49, 17], aleatoric uncertainty still lacks a standardized testing protocol. The current approaches seem to converge to soft labels, but nuances in how they are collected still need discussion (compare, for example, CIFAR-10H [41] to CIFAR-10S [7] and CIFAR-10N [55]). An increasing number of uncertainty quantification approaches compare to such human GT notions of aleatoric uncertainty [49, 24, 25, 26], indicating the interest in the field. Our benchmark shows that no method can give highly accurate aleatoric uncertainty estimates yet, stressing the need for benchmarks, methods, and training resources to develop along.\\n\\n**Predictive uncertainty and calibration.** Contrary to aleatoric uncertainty alignment, calibration and predictive uncertainty benchmarks are starting to become saturated and, according to our experiments, the top performers are ready for deployment. This corroborates recent findings by Galil et al. [14]. In comparison to this benchmark that compared model architectures, we compared nineteen different approaches on the same backbone with a wide range of aggregator functions.\"}"]}

Our quantitative findings bring an empirical foundation to recent discussions in the field, namely that 1) the aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty components of decomposition formulas are highly correlated and not disentangled, 2) epistemic and aleatoric tasks are best solved by practically tailored methods, whereas methods relying on intuitions often underperform, and 3) there is no one-fits-all uncertainty estimate. On a brighter side, our experiments also reveal the important fact for practitioners that 4) predictive uncertainty estimation achieve a high, saturating performance across almost all methods, and 5) uncertainty estimates, when trained on large amounts of data, stay robust to perturbations longer than the classifiers whose uncertainties they predict, hence enabling to safeguard the classifiers to some extent.\\n\\nA limitation of our disentanglement benchmark is that we tested on two datasets, which are both classification tasks. This is because we require ground truths for aleatoric uncertainty. Currently, the only larger-scale datasets with such ground truths, in the form of multiple annotations per input, are the two classification datasets we base our analysis on [2, 41]. Further aleatoric uncertainty ground truths are an ongoing effort [44, 7]. We encourage the expansion of the set of datasets, both within classification and to fields like regression [51] or unsupervised learning [24], to expand our uncertainty disentanglement investigations. A second limitation is that we focus on models that have converged after training on the large-scale ImageNet dataset. A different interesting setup is models trained on small amounts of data, where epistemic uncertainty may be further from convergence. For example, there is a follow-up investigation of our work by de Jong et al. [9] that undersamples the train data. We replicate parts of their main experiment results on CIFAR-10 in Appendix H.9. We encourage future works to evaluate uncertainties on an as broad array of tasks as possible to refine the understanding of which specific uncertainty tasks individual uncertainty estimators excel at.\\n\\nThis last suggestion is a corollary of how our findings changed our perspective on uncertainty quantification. There is no general uncertainty; instead, uncertainty quantification covers a spectrum of tasks where the definition of the exact task heavily influences the optimal method and performance. Such a precise definition of tasks per estimator would help construct disentangled uncertainties and could lead to the alignment of theoretical developments and intuitive descriptions about what particular types of uncertainty methods aim to capture. This pragmatic reassessment of the field could overcome the traditional one-fits-all view of uncertainty and even the more recent epistemic vs. aleatoric dichotomy and uncover the full variety of uncertainty estimates that are tailored to nuanced, practical tasks.\\n\\nAcknowledgements\\n\\nThis work was funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) under Germany\u2019s Excellence Strategy \u2013 EXC number 2064/1 \u2013 Project number 390727645.

In the framework of Evidential Deep Learning (see Appendix A.2.9), the D-S value is inversely proportional to the Dirichlet strength \\\\( S(x) = \\\\sum_{c=1}^{C} \\\\beta(x)_c \\\\) for input \\\\( x \\\\in \\\\mathcal{X} \\\\):\\n\\n\\\\[ u(x) = \\\\frac{C}{S(x)}. \\\\quad (48) \\\\]\\n\\nInformally, the more evidence the predictor has, the less uncertain it is about the input \\\\( x \\\\in \\\\mathcal{X} \\\\).\\n\\nThe D-S value can be extended to non-evidential methods by treating the exponentiated logits as pseudo-counts for the individual classes and setting\\n\\n\\\\[ \\\\beta(x) = \\\\exp(f(x)) + 1. \\\\quad (49) \\\\]\\n\\nwhere the exponentiation is applied elementwise, and the + operator denotes vector addition.\\n\\n### D.5 The Behavior of the Aggregators Does Not Align With What the Literature Suggests\\n\\nIn this section, we collect per-aggregator results of specific methods to highlight that the best-performing aggregator often goes against what these aggregators intuitively aim to capture as described in Appendix D. Below, we provide a list of abbreviations used in the figures and connect them to the formulas in Appendix D.

To quantify this, we measure the Spearman rank correlation. The Spearman rank correlation can detect any monotonic dependency between two continuous variables. Hence, in this case it will allow us to detect whether the aleatoric uncertainties are always high when the epistemic uncertainties are high. We choose this over the Pearson correlation, as the Pearson correlation can only detect linear dependencies. Although we have seen in Fig. 1 that the dependencies are, in fact, often linear, we chose the Spearman correlation because it still works even if two estimators are beyond linear correlation.\\n\\nF.2 Epistemic Uncertainty Experiments\\n\\nWe use OOD detection as a prominent proxy task for epistemic uncertainty. In OOD detection, some samples are from the ID dataset, and some are OOD. In other words, the true uncertainty here surfaces in two classes, and we want the estimated uncertainty to be higher for OOD samples than for ID samples. Such cases of a binary outcome variable predicted with a continuous estimator in a given direction can be handled by the AUROC. It measures the probability that an OOD sample will have a higher estimated uncertainty than an ID sample.\\n\\nF.3 Aleatoric Uncertainty Experiments\\n\\nIn the aleatoric uncertainty experiments, we check whether the estimated uncertainty is predictive of the true aleatoric uncertainty. The estimated uncertainty is a continuous variable, as are the true aleatoric uncertainty values. Hence, we again need a correlation metric. We again decide on the Spearman rank correlation because it can detect non-linear, monotonic relationships, and there is no prior reason to believe that, e.g., the disagreement aggregator of ensembles as an uncertainty estimator should behave linearly the same as the aleatoric uncertainty ground-truths.\\n\\nThe aleatoric ground truths are, however, often equal to zero (when all annotators agree), and one can argue that the exact amount of disagreement between humans when it is non-zero is quite noisy. This is why we also report a binarized version of the aleatoric GT uncertainty in Appendix H.4. Now, the estimated uncertainty is continuous while the GT is binary (with a direction, i.e., that GT uncertain samples should have higher predicted uncertainties). So, like above, we measure the AUROC.\\n\\nG Main CIFAR-10 Experiments\\n\\nThis section mirrors Section 3 of the main paper on the CIFAR-10 dataset whenever they were not already studied in the main paper.\\n\\nG.1 Epistemic Uncertainty: Specialized Uncertainty Estimators detect OOD Inputs the Best\\n\\nWe use balanced mixtures of ID and OOD datasets to evaluate OOD detection performance as a proxy for epistemic uncertainty. OOD samples are perturbed ID samples with severity level two. The uncertainty estimators are tasked to predict which sample is OOD, i.e., OOD inputs should have higher uncertainty estimates. As for ImageNet in Section 3.2, the Mahalanobis method is by far the most performant in telling apart clean CIFAR-10 samples from perturbed ones. However, the ranking of the remaining methods is different from that of ImageNet.\\n\\nG.2 Aleatoric Uncertainty: No Method With Outstanding Performance\\n\\nLet us now benchmark how much the estimators predict aleatoric uncertainties on CIFAR-10. Since we use the entropy of human annotator label distributions as ground truths, this could also be considered the alignment with human uncertainties. Fig. G.2 shows drastically different results from the ImageNet results in Section 3.3. Correctness prediction is most aligned on average with a notably small min-max error bar. This is reasonable since ID, the aleatoric uncertainty of the sample determines the network\u2019s correctness the most.\\\\(^5\\\\) SWAG and Loss Prediction, methods that\\n\\n\\\\(^5\\\\)Note that we train with only one label per input.\"}"]}

The best methods are saturated at very high AUROCs of 0.95. The methods are also close to the CE baseline (but with a different ranking) when slightly altering the correctness metric to account for soft labels in Appendix H.1.\\n\\nThe saturation is even more pronounced on the abstained prediction task. All uncertainty methods apart from Mahalanobis obtain an AUC score greater than 0.99 in Fig. G.4. Practically, this means that one can obtain a close-to-perfect classification accuracy by abstaining from prediction on a tiny set of samples. This is largely because the classification accuracy on CIFAR-10 is very high, so the AUAC, even of methods with worse ID uncertainty estimation like Mahalanobis, is close to perfect.\\n\\nG.4 Different Tasks Require Different Estimators\\n\\nIn the previous sections, we have hinted at the fact that the performance across methods is very similar on some tasks and dissimilar on others. In this section, we investigate the correlation among the previous practical tasks using a correlation matrix. To construct the matrix, we consider all benchmarked methods with all uncertainty aggregators (see Appendix D) and calculate the Pearson (Fig. G.5) and Spearman correlations (Fig. G.6) of performances on different metrics. Similar to ImageNet, we find consistent clusters between the Pearson and Spearman correlations. One similarity to ImageNet is also that the OOD cluster repels the other clusters. However, the aleatoric cluster on CIFAR-10H forms a unique cluster, whereas it was correlated with the Accuracy cluster on ImageNet. We believe this is due to the different ways the soft labels were obtained on ImageNet-ReaL and CIFAR-10H.\\n\\nH Further Practical Results\\n\\nH.1 Correctness Prediction\\n\\nH.1.1 ImageNet\\n\\nWe show the correctness prediction performance of methods on OOD and mixed ID + OOD datasets in Fig. H.1. Like in the main paper, evidential deep learning methods, EDL and PostNet, dominate on the correctness prediction task across all severity levels and mixtures. The performance of Mahalanobis increases on mixed datasets as it can detect OOD samples well, which happen to also be incorrect more often.\\n\\nH.1.2 CIFAR-10\\n\\nWe show the correctness prediction performance of methods on OOD and mixed ID + OOD datasets in Fig. H.2. We observe a consistent degradation of performance across methods on both dataset types.\\n\\nH.2 Performance Tendency for Increasing Severity\\n\\nIn Section 3.6 of the main paper, we show the performance of MC Dropout when going OOD, claiming that it is prototypical for other methods. Figs. H.3 and H.4 show for CIFAR-10 and ImageNet, respectively, that MC Dropout is not an outlier and other methods show very similar generalization capabilities. The only outlier is Mahalanobis, which has a bad correctness AUROC regardless of whether it is ID or OOD. In Figs. 7a, H.3 and H.4, we normalize the metrics using the formula \\\\((\\\\text{metric} - \\\\text{rnd})/(1 - \\\\text{rnd})\\\\) for direct comparability, where rnd is the base value that a random predictor achieves on that metric (0.5 for AUROC, \\\\(1/C\\\\) for classification accuracy).\"}"]}

Fig. H.5 shows how the performance of each method changes as we increase the severity level. We can see a steady increase in OOD detection performance for all methods. However, the specialized OOD detector, Mahalanobis, benefits less than the other methods. In particular, at severity level three, shallow and deep ensembles overtake Mahalanobis and remain the best estimators from then on. At severity levels four and five, Mahalanobis falls below the CE baseline. This may be because Mahalanobis was trained to detect samples at severity level two and cannot generalize as well to higher severity levels as the other methods.\\n\\nH.3.2 CIFAR-10\\n\\nFig. H.6 shows the OOD detection performance of the benchmarked methods as we increase the severity level. We can see a steady increase in the performance for all methods. However, the relative distance of the specialized OOD detector, Mahalanobis, to the other methods shrinks. This could, however, be because it is the first to arrive at a higher, possibly saturated, performance.\\n\\nH.4 Ambiguous Input Detection\\n\\nIn this section, we consider an alternative task to evaluate the alignment of methods with aleatoric uncertainty. It is a binary prediction problem where the positive samples are ones with a non-deterministic GT soft label distribution, i.e., where annotators do not unanimously agree on the class of the sample. We evaluate the AUROC of uncertainty estimators on this binary task.\\n\\nH.4.1 ImageNet\\n\\nImageNet ambiguous input detection results are shown in Fig. H.7. Method rankings are different from the continuous rankings in Fig. 3b. This indicates that, on ImageNet, the uncertainty estimators also differ in their performance on ranking within the ambiguous images.\\n\\nH.4.2 CIFAR-10\\n\\nAmbiguous input detection results on CIFAR-10 are shown in Fig. H.8. Interestingly, the ranking of methods is the same as when using rank correlations in Fig. G.2, except for MC Dropout. This could indicate that, on CIFAR-10H, most of the rankings in the rank correlations come from the methods telling apart samples with and without uncertainty, and that the ranking within the uncertain images does not make too much of a difference, or that none of the benchmarked methods (except possibly MC Dropout) is much better than the others in this.\\n\\nH.5 Abstained Prediction Results on the rAULC and E-AURC Metrics\\n\\nIn this section, we evaluate the benchmarked methods on the rAULC and E-AURC abstained prediction metrics that normalize the AUAC by the accuracy of the underlying model [43, 14].\\n\\nH.5.1 ImageNet\\n\\nImageNet rAULC and E-AURC results are shown in Fig. H.9.

First, the results of all methods on all metrics are collected. We consider three aggregators for all methods: \\\\( \\\\max \\\\bar{\\\\pi}, \\\\max \\\\tilde{\\\\pi}, \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\mathbb{E}[\\\\max \\\\pi] \\\\), using the notation introduced in Appendix D.5. These are the only aggregators that are restricted to the \\\\([0, 1]\\\\) interval, which is needed for the ECE metric and the proper scoring rules for correctness prediction. On a particular metric, each (method, aggregator) pair gives rise to one score. For each metric pair, we calculate the Pearson and Spearman correlations between the corresponding rankings of (method, aggregator) pairs.\\n\\nFig. 6 of the main paper shows Pearson correlation results on ImageNet among eight metrics, showcasing two clusters of metrics. Fig. H.13 shows the Spearman correlation results. The results are stable across these different metrics.\\n\\nTo give a more comprehensive overview of metric correlations, Fig. H.14 shows an extended correlation matrix. This matrix contains further abstinence and aleatoric uncertainty metrics, coupled with proper scoring rules for the models\u2019 predictions. Most of the added metrics fall into the bottom-right cluster. Interestingly, even though the rAULC and E-AURC metrics both evaluate abstained prediction performance, only the latter is highly correlated with the AUAC metric. The rAULC metric is more aligned with correctness prediction (corr. = 0.98) and the top-left cluster. The rank correlation results are, again, similar but more pronounced; see Fig. H.15.\\n\\nH.8 Correlations of Rankings Between Datasets\\n\\nTable H.1 shows the correlation of rankings on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet. Nine of thirteen metrics have substantially different rankings (rank. corr < 0.5). On nine of the thirteen metrics, the best-performing method also differs between the two datasets, indicating that performance on CIFAR-10 should not be taken as an estimate for ImageNet performance.\\n\\nH.9 Training on Different Training Dataset Fractions of CIFAR-10\\n\\nThis subsection shows how the uncertainties reported by different distributional methods change as we vary the training dataset size. In particular, we train on \\\\{10\\\\%, 50\\\\%, 100\\\\%\\\\} of CIFAR-10 from scratch and evaluate the trained models on the CIFAR-10 test set.\\n\\nTable H.2 shows that for the majority of the benchmarked methods, both the mean epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties of the IT decomposition decrease monotonically with an increasing training dataset size. Table H.3 shows the results using the estimators of Kendall and Gal [23], and Table H.4 shows the results of the Bregman decomposition. Fig. H.16 visualizes this tendency for the EDL method but also highlights the extreme correlation (0.9993) between the aleatoric and epistemic estimates.\\n\\nFig. H.17 shows that the severe rank correlations between the aleatoric and epistemic estimates remain when using the formulation of Kendall and Gal [23].\"}"]}

We only use an NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPU for the construction of the Laplace approximation on ImageNet, owing to the VRAM requirements of this method. Our code is based on the timm library [56], extended with a wide range of uncertainty quantification methods, evaluation metrics, ImageNet-C and CIFAR-10C corruptions, and general soft label support. The exact hyperparameter settings for each method are available in the README.md file of our published GitHub repository.\\n\\nI.1 CIFAR-10\\n\\nFor CIFAR-10, we follow the augmentations and training schedules of the uncertainty_baselines GitHub repository [38]. In particular, for non-post-hoc methods, we train a Wide ResNet 28-10 [61] for 200 epochs with a step decay schedule at [60, 120, 160] epochs with decay rate 0.2 and one learning rate warmup epoch. The only exceptions are the SNGP-variants and the DDU method (250 epochs with a step decay schedule at [75, 150, 200] epochs) [32, 37]. We use stochastic gradient descent with momentum 0.9 and a batch size of 128. Our training augmentation comprises a random crop using padding 2 and a random flip on the vertical axis with probability 0.5. We use 2/5th of the CIFAR-10 test dataset as the validation split and the rest as the test split. The learning rate and weight decay hyperparameters are chosen by ten iterations of the Bayesian optimization scheme of Weights & Biases [3] based on the correctness prediction AUROC metric on the validation split. The additional hyperparameters of benchmarked methods are determined by either using values suggested by the original authors or including these in the hyperparameter sweep.\\n\\nI.2 ImageNet\\n\\nOn ImageNet, we fine-tune a pretrained ResNet 50 [20] using the resnet50.a1_in1k parameters from the timm library as initialization. We fine-tune for 50 epochs following a cosine learning rate schedule [33] using the LAMB optimizer [60] and a learning rate warmup period of 5 epochs. We use a batch size of 128 with 16 accumulation steps, resulting in an effective batch size of 2048,\"}"]}

The authors should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the implications would be.\\n   \u2022 The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.\\n   \u2022 The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach. For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle technical jargon.\\n   \u2022 The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms and how they scale with dataset size.\\n   \u2022 If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to address problems of privacy and fairness.\\n   \u2022 While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover limitations that aren\u2019t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an important role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general, releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.\\n- While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example\\n  (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm.\\n  (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully.\\n  (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).\\n  (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.\\n\\n5. **Open access to data and code**\\n\\n   Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instructions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental material?\"}"]}

However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.\\n\\n\u2022 The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.\\n\\n\u2022 If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).\\n\\n11. **Safeguards**\\n\\n   Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models, image generators, or scraped datasets)?\\n\\n   Answer: [N/A]\\n\\n   Justification: There is no risk in abusing ImageNet or CIFAR-10 classifiers.\\n\\n   Guidelines:\\n\\n   \u2022 The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.\\n   \u2022 Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing safety filters.\\n   \u2022 Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks.
