While the reasons why LLMs would hallucinate such kind of misinformation is complex and still an open problem \u2014 noisy training data, model bias, out-of-distribution questions, or even simply because the world has moved on after a certain knowledge cutoff date, all likely contributed their fair share to this rather undesired character of LLMs [Huang et al., 2023, Zhang et al., 2023] \u2014 under a practical context, knowledge editing is often considered the go-to remedy by delivering efficient patches for such erroneous answers without significantly altering the LLM\u2019s output on unrelated queries [Sinitsin et al., 2020, Mitchell et al., 2022].\\n\\nWith the growing need to have more credible and trustworthy LLMs, a vast amount of LLM-specific knowledge editing methods have been proposed, and many of them have seen reasonable success in addressing editing targets that are simple and direct. For example, most modern knowledge editing methods can reliably edit the answer of \u201cWhat club does Lionel Messi currently play for?\u201d from \u201cParis Saint-Germain\u201d to \u201cInter Miami CF\u201d and therefore correctly reflecting the occupation status of Messi [Zhong et al., 2023].\\n\\n1.1 Multi-hop knowledge editing poses practical significance and non-trivial challenges.\\n\\nHowever, due to the intertwined nature of different knowledge fragments, a small change in one knowledge fragment can produce ripple-like effects on a vast amount of related questions [Zhong et al., 2023, Cohen et al., 2023]. It is often a non-trivial challenge to efficiently propagate the editing effect to non-directly related questions with proper precision and locality. E.g., for a \u2014 in this case intensionally extreme \u2014 question like \u201cWhat car did the wife of the owner of the club that Messi currently plays for used to get to school in the 80s?\u201d Many knowledge-edited LLMs can still struggle while being fully aware of Messi\u2019s abovementioned club transfer [Zhong et al., 2023].\\n\\nPrior arts have realized the practical significance of being able to edit such complex/non-direct questions upon a certain knowledge update, as different knowledge fragments are almost always deeply entangled with each other in the real world [Zhong et al., 2023, Cohen et al., 2023, Wei et al., 2024]. Meanwhile, exhausting all potential combinations of questions related to one or a few updated knowledge fragments is impractical, if not totally impossible: imagining editing an LLM for every possible question influenced by the abovementioned club transfer of Messi. Even if it is feasible, this poses high operational costs and comes with the intrinsic risks of editing a mass amount of targets; not to mention a repeated effort would be required should Messi ever opt to transfer again.\\n\\nIt is intuitive that a practical knowledge editing method should be able to produce correct answers to relevant factual questions with only a few updated knowledge fragments available. This task has been coined as multi-hop knowledge editing with the founding, largest, as well as the most popular dataset to date being MQA\\\\textsc{KE} by [Zhong et al., 2023]; serving as the sole evaluation backbone for many proposed modern editing methods due to the expensive nature of making counterfactual and temporal datasets at such a scale (> 10,000 cases provided, more about the dataset statistics in Table 6). Note that such expansiveness is further multiplied given the abovementioned ripple effect of multi-hop question answering, as one knowledge update of a subquestion can potentially lead to multiple updated answers across a large number of cases.\\n\\n1.2 Unfortunately, MQA\\\\textsc{KE} is flawed due to unintentional clerical and procedural errors \u2014 we fixed/remade it and re-benchmarked almost all proposed multi-hop knowledge editing methods.\\n\\nWhile MQA\\\\textsc{KE} is the founding dataset of multi-hop knowledge editing tasks and very much brings life to this vital subject, through a comprehensive audit, we reveal that up to 33% or 76% of MQA\\\\textsc{KE} questions and ground truth labels are, in fact, corrupted in various fashions due to some unintentional clerical or procedural errors; which inevitably cast doubts on the effectiveness of developed methods (especially the ones that solely) evaluated on MQA\\\\textsc{KE}, and present as a\"}"]}

We highlight that the flaws of MQA\\\\textsc{KE} is an already massive yet constantly growing issue, as MQA\\\\textsc{KE} is one of the fastest-growing datasets in terms of adaptation in the editing community, yet, the task it is trying to tackle \u2014 building more reliable LLM \u2014 is without a doubt crucial aspect of NLP development. To pave the way for future advancement of multi-hop knowledge editing, we present our work with the following contributions:\\n\\n- **A comprehensive audit of MQA\\\\textsc{KE}:** We are the first to present a comprehensive audit of the existing errors within MQA\\\\textsc{KE} \\\\cite{Zhong2023}, bringing awareness to the knowledge editing community regarding this popular dataset with significant task importance attached.\\n\\n- **Fix/remake MQA\\\\textsc{KE} to MQA\\\\textsc{KE}-Remastered:** We present the only available fix/remake that not only patches all discovered errors, and done so without sacrificing the intended intensity and capacity of the original MQA\\\\textsc{KE} whenever possible.\\n\\n- **Extensively re-benchmark of almost all existing multi-hop knowledge editing methods:** Given the currently existing reports based upon the original MQA\\\\textsc{KE} are flawed reflections of such proposed methods\u2019 capability, we additionally re-benchmark almost all existing multi-hop knowledge editing methods that are available against our MQA\\\\textsc{KE}-\\\\textsc{Remastered} datasets.\\n\\n- **Guidance for future multi-hop knowledge editing development.** Upon our extensive re-benchmark results, we observe that many proposed multi-hop knowledge editing methods intentionally or unintentionally overfit the original MQA\\\\textsc{KE} dataset by applying data-specific operations that are largely unique to the MQA\\\\textsc{KE} dataset family. We provide guidance on how to faithfully approach these datasets and additionally show that a simple, minimally invasive approach with no such operations can also achieve excellent editing performance.\\n\\n## 2 Preliminary\\n\\n### 2.1 Background of MQA\\\\textsc{KE}\\n\\nMQA\\\\textsc{KE} (Multi-hop Question Answering for Knowledge Editing) is a knowledge editing dataset focusing on the abovementioned multi-hop question answering tasks proposed in \\\\cite{Zhong2023}, where every case of MQA\\\\textsc{KE} is a multi-hop question made by a chain of single-hop subquestions. Specifically, MQA\\\\textsc{KE} is constructed based on the Wikidata:RDF dataset \\\\cite{Vrande\\\\v{c}i\\\\v{c} and Kr\u00f6tzsch2014}, which, in its rawest format, is a knowledge graph consisting 15+ trillion of Resource Description Framework (RDF) triples. MQA\\\\textsc{KE} essentially builds a much more concise subgraph with only 37 manually elected common relations and top 20\\\\% of the most common entities, where a walk of \\\\{2, 3, 4\\\\}-hop on this subgraph can form a case (which is a chain of \\\\{2, 3, 4\\\\} single-hop subquestions connected together) in the MQA\\\\textsc{KE} dataset.\\n\\nMQA\\\\textsc{KE} is presented as two (but in practice, it is essentially three) sub-datasets: MQA\\\\textsc{KE}-CF and MQA\\\\textsc{KE}-T. The former focuses on counterfactual tasks, while the latter on temporal changes. We highlight that there is also a MQA\\\\textsc{KE}-CF-3K dataset, which is a subset of MQA\\\\textsc{KE}-CF that only contains 3,000 cases in total (with 1,000 cases for \\\\{2, 3, 4\\\\}-hop questions respectively). Authors of MQA\\\\textsc{KE} evaluate their proposed method, MeLLo \\\\cite{Zhong2023}, upon this MQA\\\\textsc{KE}-CF-3K dataset, citing limited compute resources; which then become an unspoken standard practice for the majority of the later proposed multi-hop knowledge editing methods \\\\cite{Gu2024, Shi2024, Wang2024, Anonymous2024, Cheng2024}. Due to the very popularity of this sub-sampled dataset, we provide our error analysis mostly based on MQA\\\\textsc{KE}-CF-3K and MQA\\\\textsc{KE}-T in the following \u00a73. For interested readers, we additionally provide the same error analysis upon the full MQA\\\\textsc{KE}-CF in the Appendix B.2, which is only more drastic than MQA\\\\textsc{KE}-CF-3K due to MQA\\\\textsc{KE}-CF being a much larger superset of the already compromised MQA\\\\textsc{KE}-CF-3K. We also collect the dataset statistics in Table 6 to provide a numerical overview of the composition of all three MQA\\\\textsc{KE} datasets.\\n\\n\\\\url{https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P10209}\"}"]}

This is a sound practice because proper knowledge editing methods should perform well when different numbers of knowledge fragments are edited, as it is equally important to navigate when a significant amount of knowledge is updated, as well as to recognize the few edited knowledge and limit their influence from unrelated unedited knowledge with proper editing locality.\\n\\nIn its original paper, MQUAKE-CF-3K is evaluated when \\\\{1, 100, 1000, 3000\\\\} of its 3,000 cases are edited, similarly, MQUAKE-T is evaluated when \\\\{1, 100, 500, 1868\\\\} of its 1,868 cases being edited, forming an experiment report like Table 5. This kind of report granularity (a gradual coverage from a few edits to all cases being edited) is also adopted by the majority of later proposed multi-hop knowledge editing methods, either in full [Anonymous, 2024] or in spirit with different subsample settings [Gu et al., 2024, Wang et al., 2024, Shi et al., 2024, Cheng et al., 2024, Mengqi et al., 2024]. In this work, we report at an even finer level of granularity for maximum cross-reference potentials.\\n\\n3 Auditing MQUAKE\\n\\nIn this section, we present a comprehensive audit of the error pattern that existed in MQUAKE-CF-3K and MQUAKE-T [Zhong et al., 2023]. We specifically note that our audit is there to provide a better understanding to the knowledge editing community, especially when digesting methods evaluated on these datasets. Our audit is not to discredit the contribution of MQUAKE, or any of the proposed methods evaluated on MQUAKE. We recognize the fact that no dataset can be perfect, especially when it is intrinsically hard to collect large-scale counterfactual and temporal datasets.\\n\\n3.1 Intra Contamination between Edited Cases and Unedited Cases\\n\\nAs discussed in \u00a72.2, having a gradual evaluation coverage from a few to all cases being edited like Table 5 makes sense for as an evaluation granularity. However, one critical issue is that \\\\(k \\\\in \\\\{1, 100, 1000, 3000\\\\}\\\\)-edited cases (supposed MQUAKE-CF-3K) are randomly sub-sampled from the 3,000 total cases. Thus, there is no guarantee that the \\\\(k\\\\)-edited cases and \\\\((3000 - k)\\\\) unedited cases would require two disjoint sets of knowledge and, therefore, risk contamination.\\n\\nFor a concrete example, consider the following two multi-hop questions from MQUAKE-CF-3K (we also additionally provide the subquestion breakdown and intermediate answers of the two questions for better presentation, we note that such auxiliary information is not part of the instruction visible to the question-answering LLM):\\n\\n- **case_id:245** (unedited): *What is the official language of the country where Karl Alvarez holds citizenship?*\\n  - What is the country of citizenship of Karl Alvarez? USA.\\n  - What is the official language of United States of America? American English.\\n\\n- **case_id:323** (unedited): *What language is the official language of the country where Wendell Pierce holds citizenship?*\\n  - What is the country of citizenship of Wendell Pierce? USA.\\n  - What is the official language of United States of America? American English.\\n\\nFor both questions, the correct pre-edited answer should be \u201cAmerican English.\u201d As both Karl Alvarez and Wendell Pierce are US citizens, and the official language of the US is American English. However, suppose case_id:323 is sampled as an edited case while case_id:245 remains unedited, we will be provided with the additional triple containing the knowledge of \u201cThe official language of United States of America is Arabic.\u201d\\n\\nSince the unedited case_id:245 and the edited case_id:323 share the same subquestion of \u201cWhat is the official language of United States of America?\u201d The answer of case_id:323 will be rightfully updated to \u201cArabic\u201d per the new knowledge. However, the unedited case_id:245 still considers the\"}"]}

Here, we sample \\\\{1, 100, 1000, 2000, 3000\\\\}-editing targets from MQUAKE-CF-3K using random seed 100, and find the following error statistics in Table 1.\\n\\nTable 1: Error statistics of MQUAKE-CF-3K and MQUAKE-T [Zhong et al., 2023] in terms edited cases contaminating unedited cases. \\\\(k\\\\)-edited means \\\\(k\\\\) cases out of the total dataset are edited.\\n\\n| # of Contaminated | 1-edit | 100-edit | 1000-edit | 2000-edit | 3000-edit | 1-edit | 100-edit | 500-edit | 1868-edit |\\n|-------------------|--------|----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|--------|----------|----------|-----------|\\n| Cases             | 0      | 2,013    | 1,772     | 910       | 0         | 29     | 1421     | 1327     | 0         |\\n| Subquestions      | 0      | 2,706    | 3,075     | 1,664     | 0         | 29     | 1421     | 1327     | 0         |\\n\\nIt is observable from Table 1 that even a small number of edited cases will cause a concerningly large contamination to unedited cases and subquestions, where 67% and 76% of all cases from MQUAKE-CF-3K and MQUAKE-T are contaminated with just 100 cases being edited, introducing a significant distortion to the reported experiment results.\\n\\nWe additionally note while this edited-to-unedited intra-contamination is reducing with \\\\(k\\\\)-edit growing, this does not imply a diminishing of issue, but rather a simple by-product of a larger \\\\(k\\\\) implies a lesser \\\\((3000 - k)\\\\), leaving fewer unedited cases as potential contamination victims. In the extreme case of 3000-edit, there is 0 edited-to-unedited contamination because there is no unedited case left in MQUAKE-CF-3K to be the victim. But 3000-edit has the most edited-to-edited inner contamination, more on this in the following \u00a73.2.\\n\\n3.2 Inner Contamination between Different Edited Cases\\n\\nOther than edited cases contaminating unedited cases (\u00a73.1), contamination might also happen among multiple edited cases because a certain subquestion presented in different edited cases can be edited in some but unedited in others. For brevity, we leave the example walkthrough in Appendix B.1.\\n\\nTable 2: Error statistics of MQUAKE-CF-3K [Zhong et al., 2023] in terms edited cases contaminating each others. \\\\(k\\\\)-edited means \\\\(k\\\\) cases out of the total 3,000 cases are edited.\\n\\n| # of Contaminated | 1-edit | 100-edit | 1000-edit | 2000-edit | 3000-edit |\\n|-------------------|--------|----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\\n| Cases             | 0      | 14       | 265       | 619       | 998       |\\n| Subquestions      | 0      | 14       | 337       | 854       | 1,399     |\\n\\nThis type of contamination is, once again, universally visible in MQUAKE, as shown in Table 2, which is very much a flipped version of Table 1. With \\\\(k\\\\)-edit growing, there are more edited cases, thus more edited-to-edited contamination, as there are more potential victims. Notably, under the 3000-edit tasks, almost one-third \\\\((998/3000, \\\\approx 33\\\\%)\\\\) of the evaluated cases are contaminated, which again introduces distortion to the reported experiment results. We omit the report on MQUAKE-T here because there is only one edit-to-edit contamination when all 1,868 cases from MQUAKE-T are edited (case_id:424).\\n\\n\\\\(^2\\\\)We note that in Zhong et al. [2023], \u201c\\\\(k\\\\)-edit\u201d means only \\\\(k\\\\) of edited cases are evaluated, without any unedited cases. We evaluated both to better reflect the locality of different knowledge editing methods.\\n\\n\\\\(^3\\\\)Note, an edited case does not require all of its subquestions being edited, but merely one or more of it (Table 6).\"}"]}

However, MQ\\\\textsubscript{U}AKE-CF-3K also includes some straightforward conflicts, such as for the subquestion \u201cWhich company is Ford Mustang produced by?\u201d we have the following edits:\\n\\n- case\\\\_id:2566 (edited): Ford Motor Company Nintendo.\\n- case\\\\_id:231/2707 (edited): Ford Motor Company Fiat S.p.A.\\n\\nThis is going to cause a direct conflict when case\\\\_id:2566 and any of the case\\\\_id:231/2707 are both selected as edited cases, as they shall confuse any knowledge edited LLM for having two answers to the same questions. Fortunately, such types of errors are rather minuscule in MQ\\\\textsubscript{U}AKE-CF-3K, with the abovementioned Ford Mustang question and three cases being the only affected data samples.\\n\\n3.4 Missing Information in Multi-hop Question Instructions\\n\\nAs mentioned in \u00a72, the MQ\\\\textsubscript{U}AKE dataset is built upon a severely filtered Wikidata:RDF knowledge graph \\\\cite{Vrande\u010di\u0107 and Kr\u00f6tzsch 2014}. Specifically, the triples of a certain \\\\{2, 3, 4\\\\}-hop walk on this subgraph are then fed into a gpt-3.5-turbo model to generate the multi-hop question instruction in a natural language format; such generation are repeated for three different times in case any of the generated question instructions becomes incomprehensible. For every case evaluation, an LLM is considered right should it correctly answer against any three of the multi-hop question instructions \\\\cite{Zhong et al. 2023}.\\n\\nHowever, while repeating generation three times definitely reduces the chances of having incomprehensible question instructions, we noticed some of such instructions in MQ\\\\textsubscript{U}AKE are still incomplete. We take the following triple set and its generated 3-questions as an example:\\n\\n- case\\\\_id:546 (unedited): We have a 2-hop triple chain of (Albert Mohler, employer, Southern Baptist Theological Seminary) and (Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, religion or worldview, Southern Baptist Convention). MQ\\\\textsubscript{U}AKE-CF-3K provides the following generated multi-hop questions:\\n  - Generation #1: What religion is Albert Mohler associated with?\\n  - Generation #2: Which religion does Albert Mohler follow?\\n  - Generation #3: With which religious faith does Albert Mohler identify?\\n\\nIt is clear that all three generated questions omit the part mentioning which company/institution Albert Mohler is employed by and essentially reduce themselves to single-hop questions, where a correct generation should read like \u201cWhat religion is Albert Mohler\u2019s employer associated with?\u201d Without the complete question, suppose there is an edit on Albert Mohler\u2019s employer (which there indeed is one), the final answer would likely change. However, with question instruction omitting such information, even the best knowledge-edited LLM cannot answer the question correctly with a faithful approach.\\n\\nAs a general analysis, we find the natural language question instructions of 672 cases in MQ\\\\textsubscript{U}AKE-CF-3K are missing information in comparison to their raw triplet chain. This number is counted in the sense that one or more pieces of information present in the triple chain are missing from all three variants of the generated natural language instruction. Similarly, there are 2,830 and 233 cases of erroneous instructions in MQ\\\\textsubscript{U}AKE-CF and MQ\\\\textsubscript{U}AKE-T, respectively.\\n\\n3.5 Duplicated Cases\\n\\nThe last kind of error we discovered in MQ\\\\textsubscript{U}AKE is simply unintended duplication \u2014 i.e., two or more cases sharing the same start subjects, edited facts, chain of triples, and final answer. We discovered 47, 4, and 4 cases of duplication, respectively, in MQ\\\\textsubscript{U}AKE-CF, MQ\\\\textsubscript{U}AKE-CF-3K, and MQ\\\\textsubscript{U}AKE-T.\"}"]}

For Conflicting Edits and Duplicated Cases, since there are only a few such errors (<50 per type per dataset), we employ some manual corrections to address these errors: in the former case, we flip the minority edits to align with the majority edits (and adjust their answers to their subsequence subquestions, should there be any); in the latter case, we simply remove such duplicated cases (except for MQUAKE-CF-3K, which we manually select 4 more cases from MQUAKE-CF to keep the dataset having 3,000 cases in total and a 1,000 cases for \\\\{2, 3, 4\\\\}-hops). For the Missing Information in Multi-hop Question Instructions errors, we rewrite such natural language question instructions and then replace the original information-missing instructions.\\n\\n4.2 Dynamic Masking for Maximum Coverage: MQUAKE-REMASTERED-CF, MQUAKE-REMASTERED-CF-3K, and MQUAKE-REMASTERED-T\\n\\nDue to the contamination count of Intra Edited-to-Unedited Contamination (\u00a73.1) and Inner Edited-to-Edited Contamination (\u00a73.2) tend to grow in the opposite direction as shown in Table 1 and 2, it is impossible to find a fix within the current MQUAKE that can address both issues without significantly decreasing the dataset size. As an alternative, we develop an API that will take a case_id and an edited_flag as input, respectfully indicating the evaluating case-in-question and whether this case is considered edited; our API shall then return a set of triples that are contamination free by dynamically masking out the conflicting edits from other cases. After such, the user may build up an editing knowledge bank upon such triplets and conduct evaluations for any memory-based knowledge editing methods without losing any of the 9,218 cases from MQUAKE-CF or 1,868 cases from MQUAKE-T.\\n\\nSpecifically, once case_id-of-interest is given, our API would loop through all of its subquestions and identify if any of such subquestions is considered edited under another case. If there is a hit, the triple with respect to such edited subquestions is then removed from the bank of edited triples. This dynamic masking mechanism would ensure all cases within the original MQUAKE be usable against memory-based knowledge editing methods. However, the drawback of masking is it won\u2019t support parameter-based knowledge editing methods, where weight update is required. We additionally provide a MQUAKE-REMASTERED-CF-6334 to address the need for such methods (Appendix C.1).\\n\\n5 Benchmark and Discussion\\n\\nGiven almost all proposed multi-hop knowledge editing methods are evaluated on the original, error-contained, MQUAKE datasets. Here, we provide a re-benchmark of those methods against post-fix MQUAKE-REMASTERED datasets for a more reliable reporting of each method\u2019s performance.\\n\\n5.1 Experiment Coverage\\n\\n**Compared Methods** In this work, we aim to cover most, if not all, open-sourced knowledge editing methods evaluated on the original MQUAKE. To the best of our knowledge, this screening criteria include MeLLo [Zhong et al., 2023] and PokeMQA [Gu et al., 2024] as methods specifically proposed to target this multi-hop knowledge editing problem and evaluated on MQUAKE.

Last, we note DeepEdit [Wang et al., 2024] is also an open-sourced MQuAKE-evaluated method, but we excluded it due to its lack of inference optimization (>200 A100 GPU hours needed for 1-edit on MQuAKE-REMASTERED-CF-3K).\\n\\n**Covered Models** We opt to use lmsys/vicuna-7b-v1.5 [Zheng et al., 2023b], mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 [Jiang et al., 2023], and meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct [AI@Meta, 2024] as the choice of question-answering models, both for alignment with existing works [Zhong et al., 2023, Shi et al., 2024, Gu et al., 2024] as well as providing coverage the most recent language models.

These datasets are respectively corresponding to the original MQuAKE-CF, MQuAKE-CF-3K, and MQuAKE-T from Zhong et al.

{"id": "iTUlYblV0K", "page_num": 9, "content": ["{\"primary_language\":\"en\",\"is_rotation_valid\":true,\"rotation_correction\":0,\"is_table\":false,\"is_diagram\":false,\"natural_text\":\"Due to page limitation, we only present the benchmark results on MQAKE-REMASTERED-CF in the main text and refer our readers to Appendix D.2 for benchmarks of MQAKE-REMASTERED-CF-3K, MQAKE-REMASTERED-T, and MQAKE-REMASTERED-CF-6334. Given the dominance of GWalk \u2014 a demo method we proposed as guidance to future scholars of this MHKE task \u2014 we leave more discussion on this method below.\\n\\n5.3 Making Faithful Approach to MQAKE and MQAKE-REMASTERED\\n\\nAdditionally, it is also our observation that many multi-hop knowledge editing methods with decent accuracy reports on MQAKE or MQAKE-REMASTERED are utilizing designs that leverage specific data properties unique to MQAKE. For example, methods like GLAME [Mengqi et al., 2024] utilize Wikidata [Vrande\u010di\u0107 and Kr\u00f6tzsch, 2014] as the external knowledge graph to better detect the edit-induced conflicts, which happen to be the source of MQAKE as discussed in \u00a72.1. While these methods might have decent performance on MQAKE, the cost of maintaining a positive knowledge graph on the correct \u2014 but not just edited \u2014 knowledge facts is undoubtedly a non-trivial operation cost. Yet, whether sourcing the same Wikidata knowledge graph as MQAKE might bring them data-specific advantages remains unanswered. Similarly, PokeMQA [Gu et al., 2024] utilizes the 6,218 cases included in MQAKE-CF but not in MQAKE-CF-3K as the train set to train its auxiliary components. Given MQAKE is a dataset with relatively low diversity (e.g., it only includes 37 types of relations), whether having a heavily overlapped train and test set will result in data-specific advantages unique MQAKE and its variants, again remains unanswered.\\n\\nA Minimally Invasive but Performant Approach: GWalk Here, we provide a brief walkthrough of a simple method we designed, namely GraphWalk. It does not leverage any data-specific property unique to MQAKE or MQAKE-REMASTERED, yet still presents pleasant performance surpassing many established baselines. We illustrate this method as a simple guidance and potential inspiration to our future multi-hop knowledge editing scholars. Due to page limitation, we introduce the technical details and design intuition of GWalks in Appendix D.1 and only present the performance of GWalks in the main text.\\n\\nWe hope the performant nature of GWalk \u2014 in its most vanilla form, without employing any data-specific property unique to MQAKE or MQAKE-REMASTERED \u2014 can inspire more multi-hop knowledge editing methods that leverage the graph topology of edited facts, without converting such facts to natural language descriptions (at least for retrieval).\\n\\n6 Related Works\\n\\nOur work mainly conducts an audit and provides fixes to the MQAKE dataset. To the best of our knowledge, only two prior arts have touched on the errors existing in MQAKE: GMeLLo [Anonymous, 2024] (an anonymous submission to ACL ARR 2024 February) and DeepEdit [Wang et al., 2024]. As an overview, GMeLLo briefly discussed the same type of error we discussed in \u00a73.4 without providing any quantitative error analysis or any fix. DeepEdit discovered the same inner contamination error as we discussed in \u00a73.2 but specific to 3000-edit setup. DeepEdit\u2019s proposed fix is simply removing the 998 inner contaminated cases from the MQAKE-CF-3K dataset, so this fix is custom 3000-edit and done so by sacrificing 1/3 of the dataset capacity. We leave more details in Appendix E due to page limitation.\\n\\nAdditionally, our work provides a re-benchmark of most, if not all, open-sourced knowledge editing methods evaluated on MQAKE, and sets guidance on how to faithfully approach such datasets. To the best of our knowledge, no other work provides the same benchmark nor touches on the same issue.\\n\\n7 Conclusion\\n\\nOur work provides a comprehensive audit and fix of the MQAKE dataset. We further re-benchmarked all open-sourced knowledge editing methods evaluated on MQAKE with our MQAKE-REMASTERED datasets and provided guidance and examples on how to faithfully approach these datasets with our GWalk.\"}"]}

This school of editing methods has proven to be successful, mainly because it can leverage the power of retrieval-argument generation (RAG) combined with the in-context learning (ICL) capability of LLMs. Further, it is common sense that edited knowledge facts will be much less than unedited knowledge facts, making maintaining a knowledge pool exclusively containing edited facts a viable option \u2014 like done so in MeLLo [Zhong et al., 2023].\\n\\nDifferent from MeLLo, where all edited facts are converted from triples to natural language (NL) descriptions in its edited bank, GWalk preserves the edited facts in their original triples fashion and leverages the graph topology they come with. This makes maintaining this edited bank much easier \u2014 as one can easily adjust the entity or relation on a knowledge graph without rewriting every natural language description of every related edited fact. It also brings more precise retrieval mapping when a question pertaining to a certain edited fact is asked. This is because methods like MeLLo would need to RAG from a pool of edited facts in NL format, and there might always be something \u2014 though not actually related to the question asked \u2014 having a close enough embedding distance to the query question (i.e., unintended retrieval), and thus result in hallucination. However, if we simply query the entity and relations implied in a question against a knowledge graph, there is less chance of retrieving unintended materials. Specifically, GWalk works like the following Algorithm 1.\\n\\nAlgorithm 1: General Procedure GWalk on a Multi-hop Question\\n\\nInput:\\n- $M$, the Question Answering Language Model;\\n- $T$, a Text-embedding model;\\n- $Q$, a Multi-hop Question;\\n- $E$, a bank of edited facts as a knowledge graph.\\n\\nOutput:\\n- $o_p$, the answer to $Q$.\\n\\nInitialize:\\n- $i = 1$, the subquestion counter;\\n- $o_p = \\\\text{None}$, the answer from the previous subquestion.\\n\\n1. $s \\\\leftarrow \\\\text{Extracted subject from } Q$;\\n2. $rels \\\\leftarrow \\\\text{Prompt } M \\\\text{ to breakdown } Q \\\\text{ into a sequence of relations.}$\\n   /* If $Q$ is \u2018What is the official language of the country where Karl Alvarez holds citizenship?\u2019, then $s$ would be \u2018Karl Alvarez\u2019 and a possible $rels$ is [\u2018citizenship\u2019, \u2018official language\u2019] */\\n3. for $r \\\\in rels$ do\\n   4.

We note that GMeLLo merely highlights such errors but does not provide a quantified measurement of its scale nor any fix. We did both in \u00a73.4 and \u00a74.1.\\n\\nDeepEdit [Wang et al., 2024] discovered the same inner contamination error as we discussed in \u00a73.2. DeepEdit does provide a quantified measurement of the scale of such error but only pertains to the MQUAKE-CF-3K dataset, and such quantifiable results are only valid when all 3,000 cases of MQUAKE-CF-3K are considered edited; which, as shown in Table 5, only constitute one column of MQUAKE-CF-3K\u2019s reporting. Further, DeepEdit provides a rather hardcore fix to this problem by removing the 998 inner contaminated cases from the MQUAKE-CF-3K dataset \u2014 which is (supposedly) the same 998 cases we detect in Table 2 under the 3000-edit column \u2014 with the post-fix dataset denoted as MQUAKE-2002 for having 2,002 out of 3,000 cases left. While this fix is, of course, helpful, we argue our post-fix MQUAKE-REMASTERED-CF-3K, MQUAKE-REMASTERED-CF, and MQUAKE-REMASTERED-T are much more comprehensive and effective since they patched many more errors revealed in \u00a73 (which still exists in MQUAKE-2002), works outside the MQUAKE-CF-3K dataset, do not require the number of edits to be 2,002 cases, and most importantly, done so without scarifying almost 1/3 of the capacity of the original dataset.\"}"]}
