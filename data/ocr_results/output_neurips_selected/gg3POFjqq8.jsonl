While some simple synthetic corruptions are commonly applied to existing models, they do not fully capture all realistic and relevant distribution shifts of real-world images. To overcome this challenge, we apply LoRA adapters to diffusion models to realize a wide range of individual nuisance shifts in a continuous manner. While existing generative benchmarks perform manipulations in one step, we argue for gradual and continuous nuisance shifts, as they allow evaluating the sensitivity and failure points of vision models. With this in mind, we perform a comprehensive large-scale study to evaluate the robustness and generalization of various classifiers under various nuisance shifts. Through carefully-designed comparisons and analysis, we reveal multiple valuable observations: 1) More modern and larger architectures trained on larger datasets tend to be more robust to various nuisance shifts and fail later for larger scales. 2) Pre-training strategy influences the robustness and fine-tuning a CLIP classifier improves the standard accuracy but deteriorates the robustness. 3) The accuracy drops only account for one dimension of robustness and the failure point analysis should be considered as an additional dimension for robustness evaluation. We hope our continuous nuisance shift benchmark can provide a new perspective on assessing the robustness of vision models.\\n\\n1 Introduction\\n\\nMachine learning models are typically validated and tested on fixed datasets under the assumption of independent and identically distributed samples. However, this may not fully reflect the true capabilities and potential vulnerabilities of models when deployed in dynamic real-world environments. The robustness in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios is important in the real world. In safety-critical applications, decision-makers might be interested in how models perform under various specific nuisance shifts and severity levels. The term \u201cnuisance shifts\u201d refers to any intervention on a considered image distribution that alters the visual information while not changing the class of a considered target object, which can include the weather, style, or background.\\n\\nIn the past, various benchmarks have been proposed to evaluate the robustness of computer vision models. One line of benchmarks manually collects data with nuisance shifts [1, 12, 17, 18, 20, 34, 41, 45]. Yet, such approaches are not scalable and often include only a small variety of nuisance shifts.

They allow the generation of various instances of a specific object class with specified context and nuisance shifts. While rendering pipelines allow precise control of several variables and are applied for benchmarking [3, 21, 23, 35], some nuisance shifts are hard to realize using traditional pipelines, such as weather variations like snow. Recent development in diffusion models has enabled the application of generative models for training [10, 15] and benchmarking vision models [29, 30, 40, 44].\\n\\nHowever, all previous approaches define binary nuisance shifts by considering the existence or absence of that shift, which may contradict their continuous realization in real-world scenarios. For example, the snow level in an environment can range from light snowfall to objects fully covered with snow. While one model might fail at both levels, a different model might only fail when the object is heavily occluded. Thus, it is necessary to realize continuous shifts to evaluate the sensitivity of vision models and their failure points.\\n\\nTo overcome this shortcoming, we apply LoRA [19] adapters to realize a continuous variation of given nuisance shifts, and we use them for benchmarking a variety of classifiers along the following axes: (i) architecture, (ii) number of parameters, and (iii) pre-training and classification paradigms. Our new benchmark opens the path for robustness metrics beyond ImageNet accuracy: Evaluating on continuous levels allows computing the accuracy drop at specified scales and the failure point of models under a specific shift. In contrast to previous works that conduct analysis on two levels, our study reveals the following findings considering multiple levels of scales: 1) More modern and larger architectures are more robust to various nuisance shifts. 2) If a model is trained on more data using a classification or a surrogate loss, it is more robust independent of the standard accuracy. 3) Fine-tuning typically improves the standard accuracy. However, its impact on robustness varies depending on the considered models. 4) In addition to the accuracy drop as one measure of robustness, the point of failure might be a similarly important quantity to consider when the robustness with respect to a specific shift level is of relevance. Our results show that the two quantities are not always aligned and should be considered as two separate dimensions of robustness.\\n\\nOne essential requirement for using synthetic images for benchmarking is to ensure that the considered images correspond to the class distribution. Manually checking the quality of images is still common practice [44]. However, this does not allow scaling the analysis. Some approaches have been proposed for automated filtering, but there is no standard dataset for evaluating filtering strategies. We manually annotate a dataset with filter labels and use it to propose a filtering mechanism for removing out-of-class samples.\\n\\nIn summary, our work makes the following contributions: (i) We provide a framework for implementing and benchmarking vision models with respect to nuisance shifts under continuous severity levels.\"}"]}

We propose a novel filtering mechanism and apply it to our generated images. We evaluate the robustness of a variety of classifiers along different scales with respect to nuisance shifts with multiple scales. We publish a dataset for benchmarking the robustness of classifiers with respect to 14 diverse nuisance shifts at six severity levels. We additionally provide 1400 trained LoRA sliders that can be used for computing shift levels in a continuous manner.\\n\\n2 Related work\\n\\nRobustness. When referring to natural robustness, we consider the relative accuracy drop of a classifier with respect to interventions that alter images from a base distribution, building on the formalism introduced by Drenkow et al. [9]. While the robustness to generic distribution shifts is of interest, we consider the robustness with respect to specific nuisance shifts that can be modeled as causal interventions on the environment, the appearance, the object, or the renderer. We define such interventions in a continuous manner on a metric scale.\\n\\nBenchmarking Robustness. Early approaches for benchmarking robustness and generalizability of models used fixed datasets [6, 7, 24], but this lacks scalability and fails to capture the failure points some models could face in real-world applications since they usually measure performances under the assumption of independent and identically distributed samples. To address this, a first line of research involves manually collecting data with nuisance shifts [1, 12, 17, 18, 20, 34, 41, 45]. However, these methods are often time-consuming and labor-intensive because they require data crawling and human annotations. Moreover, they usually capture only a subset of nuisance shifts that models may encounter in the real world and it is challenging to ensure the independence of these annotated nuisances. Additionally, it is possible to manually apply additional nuisances to evaluate their robustness in a more controlled manner, for example with image corruptions [16] or adversarial attacks [5, 31, 37]. The second line of research uses synthetic data for benchmarking, which offers the ability to generate a large and diverse range of nuisance shifts with precise control [3, 21, 35] but are limited to nuisance that can be easily modelled (e.g., lighting, fog, occlusions). Recent developments in diffusion models have allowed some notable progress in the possibility of creating synthetic benchmark dataset [29, 30, 40, 44] with realistic data and more possibilities to control nuisances (e.g., text-guided corruptions, counterfactual). In our work, we propose a framework for benchmarking vision models with respect to nuisance shifts under continuous severity levels, as well as a novel filtering mechanism for removing out-of-class samples from synthetic data.\\n\\n3 Framework for Benchmarking\\n\\nIn this section, we present our methodology to realize continuous shifts for evaluating model\u2019s sensitivity with respect to such nuisance factors.\\n\\n3.1 Continuous Nuisance Shifts for Benchmarking\\n\\nFor evaluating the robustness of image recognition models with respect to continuous scale nuisance shifts, two characteristics are desirable: (1) The severity of the considered shift can be controlled, allowing the estimation of the shift scale where a considered model fails. (2) Realizing a nuisance shift should not come along with factors of variations that might alter the class identity. The variations should be subtle and calibrated according to a pre-defined scale, allowing a fine-grained analysis on a distribution level when considering individual images.\\n\\nMethods for Realizing Continuous Shifts. A natural way to realize nuisance factors are methods based on text prompts [25, 29, 40]. They follow the prompt template \u201cA picture of a {class}\u201d and \u201cA picture of a {class} in {shift}\u201d. This, however, does not allow the gradual increase of a nuisance for a given image. In addition, the realized nuisance shift realized by the prompt addition \u201cin {shift}\u201d largely varies for different seeds and classes. The right figure in Fig. 3 illustrates that the nuisance\"}"]}

A qualitative example is given in Fig. 2. A naive approach for realizing continuous shifts involves computing the difference between two corresponding CLIP embeddings. We explored the naive strategy following the implementation of Baumann et al. [2], but we did not achieve robust nuisance shifts for a variety of classes. A different approach that allows realizing subtle variations involves LoRA [19] adapters. LoRA are low-rank matrices that can characterize the directions of nuisance shifts. Gandikota et al. [11] propose a strategy to learn concept sliders based on LoRA adapters to learn continuous concept variations. Similarly, we realize a nuisance shift by training a LoRA adapter that realizes a low-rank concept shift $s$ for a specific class $c$: $P_{GM}(X|c+s) = P_{\\\\theta_{SD}}(X|c) \\\\cdot P_{\\\\theta_{LoRA}}(X|c, s)$, where samples are drawn from the generative model (GM) by combining the pre-trained SD model with the learned LoRA adapter. We apply LoRA adapters that are learned based on concepts specified by language. As shown in Fig. 2, applying the LoRA slider allows realizing gradual nuisance shifts. We illustrate the average variation of the image and the realization of the shift for the LoRA approach and the approach based on two prompts (2P) in Fig. 3. The variation of the images is measured using the cosine similarity of the DINOv2-R class tokens of the base image and the shifted images, while the severity of the shift is measured using the text alignment to the prompt \u201cA picture in snow\u201d. The LoRA adapter application allows gradual shifts, but the text-prompt-based application only allows one single scale for a given seed.\\n\\nThe variation of the number of noise steps [28] with active LoRA adapters controls to what extent the identity and semantics are modified when increasing the LoRA scale. We do not activate the LoRA adapter at earlier timesteps to realize variations that do not drastically change the semantic structure of the image since they are constructed at earlier timestamps of the diffusion process [27].\\n\\n### 3.2 Accounting for the ImageNet Distribution\\n\\nWe aim to evaluate a model\u2019s robustness with respect to specific nuisance shifts $s$ that alter the base ImageNet distribution $p(X_{IN}|c)$, which is conditioned on the 1k ImageNet classes $c$. For a more accurate estimate of the robustness with respect to a single considered shift, we desire a high model accuracy for the unshifted distribution. As pointed out by Vendrow et al. [40], the distribution of Stable Diffusion (SD) generated images $p(X_{SD}|c)$ differs from the ImageNet distribution, resulting in lower classification accuracies. Therefore, we use the textual inversions provided by Vendrow et al. [40] to account for the ImageNet distribution and call it IN*: $p(X_{IN^*}|c) = p(X|c)$. \\n\\n![Figure 2: Qualitative Examples for Prompt-Based and LoRA-Based Shifts including OOC Samples.](image)\"}"]}

This section presents this dataset and the selected filtering strategy.\\n\\n**Filtering of OOC Samples.** Current diffusion models allow the generation of diverse and realistic images $x \\\\sim p(X|z)$ that are consistent with a desired condition $z = [c, s_i]$ that involves the considered ImageNet class $c \\\\in \\\\mathbb{N} \\\\mid 1 \\\\leq c \\\\leq 1000$ and the variable $s_i \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}$ corresponding the level of a considered nuisance shift $i$. However, due to their probabilistic formulation, the generated sample might deviate from the the condition $z$. While low-likely samples are in general not necessarily desired, long-tail samples also occur in the real world. For benchmarking applications, we are particularly concerned if the generated samples deviate from the original class $c$, i.e., the considered class cannot be characterized anymore. We call such samples \u201cout-of-class\u201d (OOC) samples [29]. Applying a LoRA adapter can leave the naturally learned manifold of the diffusion model and is, therefore, more prone to OOC samples (see Fig. 2). Evaluating the sensitivity to specific nuisance shifts requires removing the OOC samples generated by the shift\u2019s application. Therefore, we collect a dataset of generated images to evaluate the sliding process and strategies to automatically remove OOC samples.\\n\\n**Dataset for Evaluating OOC Filtering Strategies.** To select a filter for detecting OOC samples, we collected a dataset for manual labeling: We pursue the following strategy: (i) In the first stage, 24k images are generated for 20 seeds, 5 LoRA scales, and 2 shifts per class for 100 random ImageNet classes in total. We select two very different shifts: One shift corresponds to a natural variation (snow), and the second shift corresponds to a style shift (cartoon style). (ii) Since we aim to find OOC samples that arise due to the application of the LoRA adapters, we remove all start samples without any shift that are low-likelihood samples, i.e. have a low text-alignment, and that are not classified as the corresponding class by multiple classifiers. After removing hard starting samples, the labeling dataset consists of around 18k images. (iii) To reduce the labeling effort, we filter out all easy samples that are (1) correctly classified by DINOv2-R and (2) one out of three classifiers (ResNet-50, DeiT-B/16, or ViT-B/16). (3) An additional requirement such that a sample is considered easy is a sufficiently high text alignment. (iv) Each hard image is labeled by two human annotators. To increase the dataset quality, we include soft labels if the image partially includes some characteristics of the class. So, each annotator can choose from the labels \u2018class\u2019, \u2018partial class properties\u2019, and \u2018not class\u2019. An image is defined as OOC sample if at least one annotator considers the image as an OOC. For the remaining samples, an image is considered IC (in-class) if at least one annotator labeled the image a clear sample of the corresponding class. All details on the labeling strategy and the dataset statistics are found in Appendix A.\\n\\n**OOC Filtering Strategy.** A filter serves its purpose if it removes all OOC samples, corresponding to a high true positive rate (TPR), while not removing too many in-class samples, which corresponds to a low false positive rate (FPR). Instead of simply applying a CLIP threshold as in Vendrow et al. [40], we consider a combinatorial selection approach, which requires two out of four detectors to be active. (i-ii) First, we consider text alignment to \u2018a picture of a {class}\u2019 and to \u2018a picture of a {class} in {shift}\u2019 computed via CLIP. (iii-iv) Additionally, we consider the cosine similarity to the starting images using the CLIP image encoder and the class tokens of DINOv2-R. For (i) and (ii), we select\"}"]}

We present the evaluations on the OOD-CV dataset and\\nthe large scale analysis of ImageNet classifiers.\\n\\n5.1 Evaluation on OOD-CV dataset\\n\\nTo measure the robustness, Zhao et al. [45, 46] introduce a benchmark dataset (OOD-CV) that\\nincludes out-of-distribution examples of then object categories for five different individual nuisance\\nfactors (e.g., weather) on real data. OOD-CV is the only real-world dataset that provides accurate\\nlabels of various individual nuisance shifts. However, it only provides the coarse label weather for all\\nweather-related nuisances instead of fine-grained labels such as rain, snow, fog or other. Following\\na similar approach in Sec. 4, we assign the fine-grained label using CLIP similarity. We detail the\\nstrategy for annotating OOD-CV using CLIP similarity and provide visualizations in Appendix A. We\\nevaluate classifiers on both benchmarks. Specifically, we first train different classifiers (i.e., ResNet-\\n50, ViT, and DINO-v2-ViT) on the training set of the OOD-CV benchmark. We then evaluate their\\nperformance on the data generated using our approach. Besides, we also evaluate their performance\\non the OOD-CV benchmark for each annotated sub-nuisance independently. As shown in Fig. 5, the\\naccuracy remains more or less constant with an accuracy around 95% up to a nuisance scale of 1.5.\\nFrom 2.0, the accuracy starts dropping, with the nuisance of fog and sand having the biggest impact.\\nThe resulting accuracy is consistently worse or similar to the accuracy of the highest nuisance scale\\nof our generated data for the corresponding nuisance. We hypothesize that the bigger drop is due to a\\nmajor limitation of the OOD-CV benchmark dataset: the nuisances are not completely disentangled,\\nand part of the accuracy drop originates from various other factors (e.g., image quality, image size,\\nand noise). Another hint confirming that hypothesis is the slight accuracy increase (up to +2.5%) for the rain and snow nuisances when increasing the nuisance scale from 0.0 to 1.5. Given that the\\nmodels were trained on OOD-CV benchmark training set, and evaluated on our generated data. Thus,\\nwhen corrupting the data with snow or rain, which closely relates to noise or pixelation from zooming\\nin, the data becomes closer to the training data of the OOD-CV benchmark. Hence, the OOD-CV\\nbenchmark does not fully disentangle the annotated nuisances. In contrast, our approach allows for\\nfine-grained control of nuisances, for a more complete understanding of a model\u2019s capability.\"}"]}

All models are trained in a supervised manner.\\n\\n(ii) **Model Size.** For ViT, we consider the small, medium, base, large, and huge variants of DeiT-3. For CNN, we consider the ResNet variants, e.g., 18, 34, 50, 101, and 152.\\n\\n(iii) **Paradigm and Training Data.** The selection of the training paradigm and the amount of training data are highly coupled. Therefore, we evaluate a set of models that differ with respect to the used data as well as their pre-training and classification strategy. We compare two supervised models: One model trained on IN1k, and the other model trained on IN21k and then fine-tuned on IN1k. To evaluate the effect of learning strategies, we include two more models that are trained on IN1k: A masked autoencoder (MAE) [14] and DINOv1 [4]. Additionally, we also include a VLM-based classifier using a pre-trained CLIP-model [33] and DINOv2 [32]. We include the zero-shot variant of CLIP and a version that is fine-tuned on IN1k. All models use ViT-B/16 as the backbone. Furthermore, we evaluate a diffusion classifier [22] on a smaller subset.\\n\\n**Implementation Details.** As pointed about in Sec. 3.2, we use textual inversions to account for the ImageNet distribution. To evaluate the relance of this approach, we generate 200 images of 100 randomly selected ImageNet classes using standard SD2.0 and SD2.0 with the textual inversions of IN*. To illustrate the distribution gap, we compute the accuracies for ResNet-50 and DeiT. They achieve an accuracy of 68.2% and 71.6% for the SD distribution and 74.1% and 79.1% for the IN* distribution, which equals an accuracy drop of 6% and 8%, respectively. We perform all the following experiments using the IN* distribution. We use SD2.0 and we activate the LoRA adapters for the last 75% of noise steps. Due to the computational complexity, we perform sliding for 100 classes. To get an estimate of the robustness on a scale of ImageNet, we classify 1k classes using off-the-shelf classifiers without applying masking, as e.g., done by Hendrycks et al. [17]. We ablate in Appendix A how the number of classes influences the robustness evaluations.\"}"]}

Similarly, ConvNeXt fails later than ResNet-152.\\n\\nLarger models are more robust: This follows the results in Hendrycks et al. [17]. Our analysis shows that this behavior can be consistently reported for varying shift severities and for all considered nuisance factors (Fig. 7a, Model size). For this axis, the evaluation of the failure point is in line with the accuracy drop (Fig. 7b, Arch.).\\n\\nUsing more data improves robustness: The most robust classifiers were trained on large datasets, such as the CLIP models on LION or DINOv2 on LVD-142M. We report a better robustness for the model that was pre-trained on IN21k as well (Fig. 7a, Paradigm).\\n\\nMAE is the most robust pre-training strategy: When comparing the models trained on the same dataset size, we observe that the fine-tuned MAE achieves the best robustness. (Fig. 7a, Paradigm) We use the DINOv1 model with a linear head for classification. Interestingly, it has a lower robustness than the ViT that was trained using a supervised loss. This might be attributed to the lower performance when only using linear probing. E.g., while the supervised approach (SUP-IN1k) showed better performance (Fig. 7a, Paradigm) than the MAE-based approach, MAE fails in average later than SUP-IN1k in case it fails (Fig. 7b, Paradigm).\\n\\nSome models have a larger accuracy drop but fail later: Failure points are therefore a reasonable additional metric to evaluate the robustness of models with respect to continuous shifts.\\n\\nFine-tuning improves the accuracy but deteriorates the robustness for CLIP: The CLIP classifier applied in a zero-shot manner is more robust (Fig. 7a, Paradigm) while having a lower average accuracy: 89.5% vs. 84.2%. We report all accuracies in Appendix A.\\n\\nDiffusion classifiers seem not to be more robust than discriminative models. We evaluate the accuracy drop of the DiT-based diffusion classifier for 1k images on a subset of our dataset (around 400 images) for the snow and the cartoon style shift due to computational constraints. When comparing the performance on the same reduced dataset, the accuracy drops for the LoRA scale 2 of snow (cartoon) shift by around 0.12 (0.37) percent points for the diffusion classifier using the L1 loss computations strategy [22] and by around 0.12 (0.30) percent points for a ViT-B model trained on IN1k. The accuracy drops reported for the evaluated discriminative models on the subset are almost in line with the experiments on the labeled dataset Fig. 6. We provide more results in Appendix A.\\n\\nFailure points differ across different types of shifts: Comparing the failure point of various models largely differs when considering individual shifts as shown in Fig. 7c. Snow can be considered as an example shift that slightly changes the appearance and mainly adds a disturbance factor in the image. While there are some differences, the qualitative distribution is comparable for all models. On the contrary, the cartoon and sketch variation correspond to a style shift. Here, the failure points of less robust models are more concentrated.\\n\\n6 Conclusion\\n\\nThis work fills the gap in generative robustness benchmarks that did not allow the application of a continuous shift level. In addition, we introduced the concept of failure points for benchmarking, providing an additional dimension to measure robustness. We applied LoRA adapters to realize fine-grained alterations of the image and benchmarked various classifiers along three axes. Furthermore, we discussed the importance of detecting out-of-class class samples when benchmarking using diffusion-generated images. We hope our proposed benchmark can motivate further research in the domain of using generated images for evaluating the natural robustness of vision models. Future work can improve the calibration and composition of various nuisance shifts.\"}"]}

For all authors...\\n\\n   (a) Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the paper\u2019s contributions and scope? [Yes] Our contributions are mentioned in the abstract, the introduction (summarized in lines 70-79), and they are representative of our actual contribution to the field.\\n\\n   (b) Did you describe the limitations of your work? [Yes] We do not have a dedicated limitation section in our work. However, we made an utmost effort to describe in details (see Sec. 4) our filtering procedure to ensure that the generated data was reaching our quality standards. We also discuss the importance of this filtering process and provide an estimate of its failure rates.\\n\\n   (c) Did you discuss any potential negative societal impacts of your work? [N/A] Our work does not have any potential negative societal impacts. In this work, we use diffusion models but their societal impacts have already been thoroughly discussed in papers introducing them.\\n\\n   (d) Have you read the ethics review guidelines and ensured that your paper conforms to them? [Yes] After a careful review of the ethics guidelines, we believe that our paper conforms to them.\"}"]}

[Yes] Yes, in the supplemental material.\\n\\n(c) Did you report error bars (e.g., with respect to the random seed after running experiments multiple times)? [No] For computational reasons, we could not run experiments multiple times. Instead, we preferred focusing on performing experiments with a variety of architectures, model sizes, and paradigm which all provide consistent results. Hence, we believe that the inclusion of error bars would not alter the findings presented in this work. Similarly, we used a large but fixed set of seeds to generate the images used in the benchmark.\\n\\n(d) Did you include the total amount of compute and the type of resources used (e.g., type of GPUs, internal cluster, or cloud provider)?
