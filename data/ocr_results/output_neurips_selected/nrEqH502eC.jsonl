Existing benchmarks for evaluating LLMs\u2019 cultural sensitivities are limited to a single language or collected from online sources such as Wikipedia, which do not reflect the mundane everyday lifestyles of diverse regions. That is, information about the food people eat for their birthday celebrations, spices they typically use, musical instruments youngsters play, or the sports they practice in school is common cultural knowledge but uncommon in easily collected online sources, especially for underrepresented cultures. To address this issue, we introduce BLEnD, a hand-crafted benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs\u2019 everyday knowledge across diverse cultures and languages. BLEnD comprises 52.6k question-answer pairs from 16 countries/regions, in 13 different languages, including low-resource ones such as Amharic, Assamese, Azerbaijani, Hausa, and Sundanese. We construct the benchmark to include two formats of questions: short-answer and multiple-choice. We show that LLMs perform better for cultures that are highly represented online, with a maximum 57.34\\\\% difference in GPT-4, the best-performing model, in the short-answer format. For cultures represented by mid-to-high-resource languages, LLMs perform better in their local languages, but for cultures represented by low-resource languages, LLMs perform better in English than the local languages. We make our dataset publicly available at: \\\\url{https://github.com/nlee0212/BLEnD}.\\n\\n1 Introduction\\n\\nDespite the worldwide usage of large language models (LLMs), capturing cultural everyday knowledge specific to a particular country or region is challenging because such knowledge is often not explicitly documented in online data sources like Wikipedia, which are commonly used to train LLMs. For instance, the answers to mundane everyday questions such as \u201cWhat can typically be found in the backyard of houses in your country?\u201d are not included in the training data of LLMs, except for a handful of highly represented regions such as North America. Consequently, LLMs may provide incorrect, incomplete, or nonsensical responses to everyday questions in underrepresented cultures.\\n\\n*Equal contribution.\\n*Co-first authors: junho00211@kaist.ac.kr, nlee0212@kaist.ac.kr, zhouy131@cardiff.ac.uk\"}"]}

BLEND is built through 4 steps: question collection, question filtering & translation, answer annotation, and answer aggregation.

We evaluate LLMs by short-answer and multiple-choice questions.\\n\\neven though these inquiries are frequently encountered in daily lives. This can lead to hallucinations or stereotypical responses, potentially offending a large and diverse user base.\\n\\nThis challenge becomes even more evident in cross-lingual settings, as most LLMs are primarily trained on English data reflecting Western perspectives [8, 20, 15]. They often reflect the stereotypes present in the training data [19, 18, 21, 36, 13], hence these models would often respond based on Western perspectives rather than reflecting actual diverse practices. Ideally, language models would reflect the cultural norms of various regions around the world and generate culturally appropriate content when responding in local languages of the regions, unless otherwise specified. To develop multilingual LLMs with such cultural appropriateness, we first need to evaluate the cultural commonsense knowledge. However, there is no well-crafted multilingual multicultural benchmark that captures the daily lives of people in diverse cultures.\\n\\nTo bridge this gap, we present BLEND, a Benchmark for LLMs on Everyday knowledge in Diverse cultures and languages. The benchmark covers 13 languages spoken in 16 different countries and regions shown in Table 1. Note that we include languages that are spoken in two regions with vastly different cultures, such as South Korea and North Korea, both represented by the Korean language. To effectively capture the cultural diversity of people\u2019s daily lives, we recruit annotators who are native speakers from various countries. The final dataset includes 500 socio-cultural question-answer pairs for each country/region in 6 categories: food, sports, family, education, holidays/celebrations/leisure, and work-life. To capture a comprehensive understanding of the cultural sensitivity of LLMs, we create a set of questions and answers in two formats: short-answer and multiple-choice questions. The overall framework for construction and evaluation of BLEND is shown in Figure 1. The statistics of BLEND are shown in Table 1.

Cultural knowledge is critical in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, contributing significantly to their success across various downstream applications.\\n\\nNumerous studies have examined the socio-cultural aspects of LLMs. Previous work on cultural NLP defines culture as the way of life of a specific group of people [10]. Most research on the cultural knowledge of LLMs centers on the culture at a national level. Anacleto et al. [1] collect commonsense knowledge about eating habits in Brazil, Mexico, and US through the Open Mind Common Sense portal. GeoMLAMA [33] introduces 16 geo-diverse commonsense concepts and uses crowdsourcing to compile knowledge from 5 different countries, each in its native languages. Nguyen et al. [22] introduce a methodology to extract large-scale cultural commonsense knowledge from the Common Crawl corpus on geography, religion, and occupations. CREHate [17] is a cross-cultural English hate speech dataset covering annotations from 5 English-speaking countries. CultureAtlas [9] includes textual data encapsulating the cultural norms from 193 countries, primarily sourced from Wikipedia documents in English. However, the majority of these studies are conducted exclusively in English and focus on more objective aspects of culture that are written in formal data sources.\"}"]}

For instance, CLIcK [14] and HAE-RAE Bench [29] evaluate LLMs\u2019 knowledge in Korean, while COPAL-ID [32], ID-CSQA [26], and IndoCulture [15] include culturally nuanced questions in Indonesian. Nonetheless, we do not know of any work that has been done to compare the cultural adaptiveness of LLMs across diverse languages and cultures using the same question set, which would enable a direct comparison.\\n\\nOther recent work focuses on capturing the everyday cultural nuances of LLMs using social networking platforms. StereoKG [7] extracts cultural stereotypes of five nationalities and five religious groups from questions posted on X (formerly Twitter) and Reddit. However, this method produces a significant amount of noisy and inappropriate assertions due to insufficient filtering. CAMEL [20] includes masked prompts from naturally occurring contexts on X, focusing on Arabic content, and CultureBank [28] is a collection of diverse perspectives and opinions on cultural descriptors, including English comments from TikTok and Reddit. However, these datasets are limited to a single language and rely solely on data available from social media, not able to capture people\u2019s everyday behaviors to the full extent [31].\\n\\nIn contrast to prior work, BLEND is carefully human-crafted, capturing everyday life cultural knowledge across 13 languages spoken in 16 different countries/regions including underrepresented regions such as West Java and North Korea.\\n\\n3 Construction of BLEND\\n\\nLanguage Coverage. We select languages with varying levels of resource availability using the metrics defined by Joshi et al. [12]. The resource availability of languages included in BLEND is shown in Table 4 in the Appendix. Additionally, we involve at least one author who is a native speaker of the language and originally from the country/region represented in the dataset to handle the data inspection process.\\n\\nQuestion Collection and Filtering. BLEND includes 500 question templates that reflect daily life aspects across six socio-cultural categories: food, sports, family, education, holidays/celebrations/leisure, and work-life. To create these templates, we collect 10-15 questions for each category from at least two native annotators per country/region. These annotators are asked to generate culturally relevant questions about their countries while avoiding stereotypical questions. The question generation guideline is shown in Appendix B.4. The collected questions are filtered\\n\\n---\\n\\n2 North Korea was an exception, where we collaborated with a South Korean researcher studying North Korean language.\"}"]}

Higher numbers of shared lemmas indicate that those countries/regions provide more similar answers compared to other countries/regions (e.g., Indonesia and West Java).\\n\\nto eliminate duplicates and country-specific items that can only apply to one country/region. For example, items with proper nouns from a single country/region are excluded. Then the questions are formatted into templates like \u201cWhat is a common snack for preschool kids in your country?\u201d Subsequently, \u2018your country\u2019 is replaced by the country/region names for localizing the questions. Except for US and GB, the questions are translated into the local languages by the native speakers. This process results in a comprehensive dataset of 15,000 short-answer questions, as shown in Table 1. The specific number of questions per topic is shown in Table 2.\\n\\n**Answer Annotation.** To obtain the answers to the collected questions, we recruit annotators who are native speakers of the target languages and are originally from the target regions/countries. We ensure that the annotators have lived in these countries for over half of their lifetimes. For most countries, we recruit annotators through Prolific. However, in cases where it is not possible to find annotators through crowdsourcing platforms (i.e., DZ, KR, KP, AZ, JB, AS, NG, and ET), we directly recruit five annotators who meet our criteria.\\n\\nAnnotators are required to give at least one short answer to each question and can offer up to three responses if a single answer is insufficient. If an annotator does not know the answer, they can choose from the following options: \u2018not applicable to our culture,\u2019 \u2018no specific answer for this question,\u2019 \u2018I don\u2019t know the answer,\u2019 or \u2018others.\u2019 By default, responses are collected from five annotators per question. If an annotator chooses \u2018I don\u2019t know the answer\u2019, we discard the response and collect a new one. This process continues until five valid responses for each question are obtained, or more than five annotators choose \u2018I don\u2019t know\u2019. Examples of the collected questions with answers from each country are presented in Figure 1. The guideline and the interface for answer annotation provided to annotators are shown in Appendix B.5 and B.6.\\n\\n**Answer Aggregation.** We request 1-2 annotators from each country to review the annotations and remove invalid answers. These invalid answers appear to be due to some annotators misunderstanding a question, leading to nonsensical answers. Additionally, due to the nature of natural language, there are multiple variations of a single term (e.g., \u201cgo to bed\u201d and \u201csleep\u201d). We instruct the annotators to group these variants into one to ensure the final dataset contains accurate vote counts for each answer. We also ask the annotators to translate all the annotations into English. As a result, our final dataset includes variants in local languages and English, along with a final vote count for answers to the question.\\n\\n---\\n\\n3 This condition was not fully met for North Korea due to a very limited pool of annotators.\\n\\n4 [https://www.prolific.co/](https://www.prolific.co/)\\n\\n5 Tables 5 and 6 in the Appendix shows a detailed demographic distribution of the annotators.\"}"]}

We analyze the annotations to assess their quality and consistency, as detailed in Table 7 in the Appendix. Despite the subjective nature of the questions, the average level of agreement among annotators, calculated by the average of the maximum votes for each question, is 3.16 out of 5 (63.2%). The balance within the dataset indicates that while there is consensus on certain annotations, there is also a substantial variety in the answers within each country, reflecting a diverse range of perspectives.

On average, there were 1.01 out of 5 such responses per question, with a standard deviation of 0.35 (ranging from a high of 1.912 in Northern Nigeria to a low of 0.42 in South Korea). The frequency of 'I don\u2019t know\u2019 responses was higher in the sports and holidays/celebrations/leisure categories, likely due to questions on sports or holidays that are not widely recognized or celebrated in certain countries or regions.\\n\\nFurthermore, we measure the overlap of answers between countries/regions by calculating the number of shared lemmas of the English versions of annotations to compare the trend between them and show the result in Figure 2. The result indicates that countries/regions with closely aligned cultural backgrounds exhibit higher overlaps in answers. The top pairs with the most similar responses are Indonesia & West Java (a province in Indonesia), the United States & the United Kingdom, and Spain & Mexico, likely due to shared historical, linguistic, or cultural ties that influence how questions are understood and answered. On the other hand, the pairs with the lowest value are Northern Nigeria & Greece/Ethiopia/South Korea. This could be due to the fact that Northern Nigeria has its own unique regional culture captured in the dataset.\\n\\n4 LLMs Cultural Knowledge Evaluation\\n\\nWe measure how the current LLMs perform on BLEND on the two task settings: short answer and multiple-choice. Details for the experimental settings and the 16 evaluated models can be seen in Appendix C.1.\\n\\n4.1 Short Answer Questions (SAQ)\\n\\nExperimental Setting. In this experiment, we measure LLMs\u2019 performance on SAQ. The final score for each country is calculated as the average score over two prompts: 1) directly ask LLMs to provide the answer, and 2) add persona to the LLMs to make them act as a person from the target country or region. The detailed prompts are shown in Appendix C.2.1. To compute the score, we first mark the LLM\u2019s response as correct if it is included in the human annotators\u2019 responses to the same question. Then we compute the percentage of questions to which LLM\u2019s answer is correct. More details on calculating the scores can be found in Appendix C.2.2.\\n\\nWe compute the scores for all the countries based on the results obtained for the local language and English, respectively. We use lemmatizers and stemmers to handle highly inflectional languages such as Arabic and variations in words. The details are shown in Appendix C.2.2. In addition, we remove accents from words in languages that contain accents, such as Spanish and Greek, to ensure that the annotations from human annotators match the responses of LLMs. When computing the scores, we ignore questions for which three or more annotators do not know the answer.\\n\\n4.1.1 LLM Performance on SAQ\\n\\nFigure 3a presents the performance of five LLMs on short answer questions in the local languages of target countries/regions.

Hence we make the MCQ to enable simpler evaluation of LLMs. One limitation of our MCQ is that it is only available in English, as the incorrect options were chosen from different cultures\u2019 responses to the same questions, and translating all of those requires additional work. We plan to release a multilingual version of MCQ soon.\\n\\n#### 4.2.1 MCQ Construction\\n\\nWe make the multiple-choice questions about each target country/region in English, with other answer options from other countries/regions. For fair comparison across all countries, we remove questions for which at least one country has an annotation of \u2018not applicable to our culture,\u2019 or more than three annotators don\u2019t know the answer. We also remove questions where all annotations have one vote each, indicating no typical answer from that country for that question. We determine the correct answer for each question by selecting the annotation with the highest votes from each country. We provide four answer options for each question, with no more than one option from any of the other countries. The detailed process of choosing plausible incorrect answer options can be seen in Appendix [C.3.1]. The final multiple-choice question prompt is shown in Appendix [C.3.3].\\n\\n#### 4.2.2 LLM Performance on MCQ\\n\\nIn general, models show higher performance in MCQ than in SAQ as shown in Figure [4]. This improvement is due to using questions with well-defined answers for multiple-choice questions. However, the pattern of displaying higher performance in high-resource cultures remains consistent. When considering the tendencies of all countries/regions for each model, the average Pearson correlation between the average performance in SAQ in the local languages and English across all countries/regions and the MCQ performance across all countries/regions is notably strong at 0.93. Furthermore, the Pearson correlation between the average model performance in English SAQ for all countries and that in MCQ exhibits a considerably high value of 0.98. This indicates a strong alignment between the two evaluation formats.\\n\\n### 5 Human Evaluation\\n\\nWe conduct a human evaluation for short-answer responses from LLMs to understand the source of errors. We use responses from GPT-4, the best-performing model, for short-answer questions. We define the following categories: *stereotypical, partially correct, refusal, nonsensical, unnatural language*, and *different country\u2019s view* to analyze 120 wrong answers based on the automated evaluation. The detailed instructions and the definitions of each category can be found in Appendix [D.3.1]. Also, the summary of the human evaluation results can be found in Table [13].\\n\\nThe most stereotypical responses came from answers generated for underrepresented languages/cultures such as Ethiopia, West Java, and Assam, with 48.33% of responses from Ethiopia being stereotypical. Most stereotypical questions were related to food or festivals, where the LLM attempted to provide traditional information about the country or the region without fully understanding the context. For instance, for West Java, the LLM frequently answered any food-related questions with \u2018Seblak,\u2019 one of the most famous dishes originating from the region.\\n\\nNotably, countries with a high percentage of partially correct answers or refusals were all from underrepresented cultures, such as Azerbaijan, North Korea, Northern Nigeria, and Ethiopia.

The same trend was observed for nonsensical answers, indicating that the capability of LLMs to comprehend questions is limited for low-resource languages. There were also many hallucinations for low-resource languages, such as providing \u2018Ruslan Cfrog\u2019 as the most famous basketball player in Azerbaijan, despite the non-existence of a famous player with that name.\\n\\nGPT-4 also tends to provide answers from the perspective of other countries when responding to queries about Azerbaijan and North Korea. For Azerbaijan, many answers were from the perspectives of other countries in the Caucasus region, and for North Korea, most responses were from the perspective of South Korea. This aligns with the annotations for unnatural language, as the same two countries had the highest ratio of unnatural language. In the case of Azerbaijan, there were instances where the LLM even responded in Turkish. For North Korea, a surprising 18.33% of the responses were marked as unnatural because they were phrased in the words used exclusively in South Korea.\\n\\n6 Conclusion\\n\\nIn this paper, we present BLEND, a benchmark to evaluate the cultural knowledge about everyday life within 16 current LLMs in 16 countries/regions and 13 distinct languages.\\n\\nOur experimental findings indicate that current LLMs demonstrate a high level of competence in highly represented cultures such as the United States and the United Kingdom. However, their performance is significantly lower in the case of less-represented and underrepresented cultures and languages, especially when prompted in the local language. This outcome is observed in both short-answer questions and multiple-choice questions. Furthermore, our study reveals the performance gap between two countries using the same language, highlighting a cultural bias among those regions. Moreover, the study shows that the performance of LLMs varies depending on the language used in prompting: LLMs generally perform better in local languages for mid-to-highly represented cultures, while for underrepresented cultures, they perform better in English.\\n\\n7 Limitations and Future Work\\n\\nOne limitation of our approach is the relatively small number of annotators, typically five per question, sometimes from the same locality within one country. This might not fully represent the countries/regions we include in our dataset. Extending efforts to increase the number of annotators per country, especially from diverse regional bases within each of the countries/regions, will be the most immediate future work of this research. Moreover, most language experts involved in the benchmark creation were academics proficient in English, the reference language for communication and translation. This may bias part of the construction process as they may not be fully representative\"}"]}

We do not claim that our data fully represents all the speakers of any language/region, but our dataset remains a good starting point for researchers interested in the topic.\\n\\nAdditionally, evaluating short-answer questions poses noticeable challenges. Despite the extensive human effort and using lemmatizers/stemmers, accounting for all word variations is difficult, leading to correct answers not being evaluated accurately. Our dataset also faces challenges in evaluating long-form responses from LLMs, as the annotated data is based on short answers. Future work should focus on accurately evaluating the cultural adaptiveness of LLMs in long-form natural contexts, as limitations exist within prompt-based evaluations.\\n\\nAcknowledgments and Disclosure of Funding\\n\\nThis project was funded by the KAIST-NAVER hypercreative AI center.

In each spreadsheet, you need to write down the questions and the corresponding answers to each question. Write them down in your native language, and add their translation into English too in the spreadsheet provided.\\n\\nPlease find below a few guidelines to take into account when writing the questions:\\n\\n- **Questions and answers should be a culture specific question related to your culture** (can be a common sense question). For example, a question related to the sport topic could be \u201cWhat is the most popular sport in your country?\u201d. You should refrain from writing factual questions as much as possible.\\n\\n- **Do not generate yes or no questions or answers that only have two options** (e.g. male or female). You could convert a yes or no question to a question starting with question words. Instead of asking \u201c\u2018Do people in your country tend to get off work at 5:30 pm?'\u201d, you may ask \u201cWhat time do people in your country tend to get off work?\u201d.\\n\\n- **Please write questions distinct from each other as much as possible** under each topic.\\n\\n- **The answer should be short and concrete.** It is better to use precise concepts, entities, time, etc. to answer each question.\\n\\n- **Please avoid asking questions about a very stereotypical topic.** For instance, avoid questions like \u201cWho bears more responsibility for taking care of children at home in your country?\u201d\\n\\nB.5 Answer Annotation Guidelines\\n\\nFigure [11] shows the annotation guidelines given to the annotators for all countries/regions. We provided guidelines, all in their local languages.\\n\\nB.6 Answer Annotation Interface\\n\\nFigure [12] shows the annotation interface shown to the crowdworkers annotators in Prolific. We used an Excel sheet for annotators recruited by direct recruitment for the annotations (i.e., for low-resource languages).\\n\\nB.7 Annotation Analysis\\n\\nTable [7] shows the level of agreement between the annotators, calculated by averaging the maximum votes among answers for each question in different categories across countries. Additionally, Table [8] shows the average number of answers per questions per categories across countries.

Answer the following question, providing a single answer without any explanations.\\n\\n{QUESTION}\\n\\nC.2.2 Details of Short Answer Evaluation\\n\\nLet $Q$ denote the question set, $A_q$ the annotated answer set for each question $q \\\\in Q$, with each answer $a \\\\in A_q$, for a question $q$ in the country or region $c$ in the human annotation. For any LLM prediction $y$, we define $s_{q,c}(y)$ as\\n\\n$$s_{q,c}(y) = \\\\begin{cases} 1, & \\\\text{if } \\\\exists a \\\\in A_q \\\\text{ such that } a \\\\subseteq y \\\\\\\\ 0, & \\\\text{otherwise} \\\\end{cases}$$\\n\\nso that $s_{q,c}(y)$ is 1 if the prediction $y$ includes any of the answers from the human annotations, denoted as $a \\\\subseteq y$, and 0 otherwise. For a model $m$ that outputs $f_m(q, c)$ when given $q$ and $c$, the score $S(c)$ for each country or region $c$ is calculated as\\n\\n$$S(c) = \\\\frac{1}{|Q|} \\\\sum_{q \\\\in Q} s_{q,c}(f_m(q, c)) \\\\times 100.$$  \\n\\nTo evaluate LLM responses, we lemmatize/stem/tokenize the annotations and LLM responses for each question to consider the language variations. We use one of the three techniques that are available for each language.\\n\\nWe use the lemmatizer from the English model from SpaCy (en_core_web_sm) for English. For Spanish and Amharic, we use lemmatizers from SparkNLP\\\\(^{16}\\\\). For Indonesian, we use the lemmatizer from Kumparan NLP Library\\\\(^{17}\\\\). For Chinese, we use jieba\\\\(^{18}\\\\), a Chinese word segmentation module. For Korean, we use the Okt lemmatizer from the konlpy package\\\\(^{19}\\\\). For Arabic, we use Qalsadi Arabic Lemmatizer\\\\(^{20}\\\\). For Greek, we use the CLTK Greek lemmatizer\\\\(^{21}\\\\). For Persian, we use Hazm, a Persian NLP Toolkit\\\\(^{22}\\\\). For Azerbaijani, we use the Azerbaijani Language Stemmer\\\\(^{23}\\\\). We use SUSTEM, a Sundanese Stemmer\\\\(^{24}\\\\) for Sundanese. We use the Assamese tokenizer from Indic NLP Library\\\\(^{25}\\\\) for Assamese. For Hausa, we use the Hausa Stemmer\\\\(^{26}\\\\).\\n\\nC.3 Multiple Choice Question\\n\\nC.3.1 Multiple Choice Question Construction\\n\\nTo create plausible incorrect answer options for questions about the target country/region, we first consider all answer annotations from all other countries with at least two votes. Then, we sort these answer candidates by their vote count from each country/region. Next, we check each candidate to see if it is similar to any annotations collected from the target country/region. If it is, we block that candidate from being added as a wrong answer choice, as well as the same answer from the other countries/regions. We use GPT-4 to determine if two words are similar in meaning, such as \u2018fruit\u2019 and \u2018apple\u2019, as the two can be considered the same when answering the question. The prompt can be seen in Appendix C.3.2.\\n\\nAs this process would lead to differing possible wrong answer options for each target country per question, we pick the answer options with the minimum number of possible wrong answer options among all countries.

We use GPT-4 (see Appendix C.3.2 for the prompt details) to produce dummy answer options to make the number of options comprised of one correct answer and three wrong answer options four. If there are multiple correct answers, we generate multiple versions of the question, each with a different correct answer. The choices are provided in alphabetical order when asked to LLMs in a multiple-choice format.\\n\\n### C.3.2 Prompt for Multiple Choice Question Construction\\n\\n**Similar Term Detection.** Since we asked the human annotators to provide answers in a short answer format, there may be cases where different textual answers refer to the same meaning. To avoid duplicate options in multiple-choice format, we utilized GPT-4 to determine whether the answers have the same meaning using the following prompt:\\n\\nDetermine if a \u2018target\u2019 word is the same in meaning (e.g., football & soccer or soccer & football) to at least one of the \u2018answer\u2019 words, or one is a subset to another (e.g., fruit & apple or apple & fruit). If so, the \u2018result\u2019 for \u2018target\u2019 word is \u2018O\u2019. However, if the two simply falls into the same level of hierarchy, the \u2018result\u2019 is \u2018X\u2019 (banana & apple, rose & carnation).\\n\\nNote that the \u2018answer\u2019 list is from \u2018answer_country,\u2019 and the \u2018target\u2019 word is from \u2018target_country,\u2019 as written by a person.\\n\\nWrite down your reasoning first. Do not write any other JSON formatted object in your answer except for the result JSON object, formatted as \\\\{\"result\":\"O\"} or \\\\{\"result\":\"X\"}.\\n\\n**Dummy Options Generation.** In cases where a question has fewer than four options during the option generation process, we ask GPT-4 to produce dummy options using the following prompt:\\n\\nProvide \\\\(3 - n\\\\) dummy option(s) that makes sense to be the answer(s) of the given \u201cquestion\u201d, and has to exist in real-life (non-fiction), but is totally different from the given \u201canswers\u201d without any explanation. Make sure that the options are different from each other, and cannot be an answer from any country. Provide as JSON format: \\\\{\"dummy_options\":[]\\\\}\\n\\n### C.3.3 Prompt for Multiple Choice Evaluation\\n\\nWe use the following prompt to evaluate the LLMs\u2019 performance in multiple-choice format:\\n\\n{QUESTION} Without any explanation, choose only one from the given alphabet choices (e.g., A, B, C).

Finally, if at least one answer is completely inapplicable to the country/region, the response is annotated as incorrect.\\n\\n**Unnatural Language.** The response from the model is annotated as unnatural if it is phrased in a way that a native speaker would not typically use. This includes instances where words sound like direct translations from English, phrases that sound unnecessarily formal, or when a different language is used to answer.\\n\\n**Stereotypical.** This includes responses containing stereotypical answers about a target country/region. For example, providing the most common traditional food in the country/region as an answer to a completely unrelated question would be considered a stereotypical response.\\n\\n**Partially correct.** The response is annotated as partially correct when the model\u2019s response contains multiple answers and at least one is completely inapplicable to the general population of the country/region.\\n\\n**Refusal.** This category indicates where the model declines to provide an answer despite the annotators having determined that a valid answer exists.\\n\\n**Nonsensical.** Nonsensical answers include hallucinations from the model or are completely incorrect by not answering the question properly (e.g., answering \u201csoccer\u201d for a question about a sport played without a ball).\\n\\n**Different country\u2019s view.** A response is annotated under this category if the model includes answers from the viewpoint of a different country/region. For instance, it includes answers from neighboring countries or countries sharing a similar yet different culture.\\n\\n### D.3.2 Human Evaluation Result\\n\\nThe summary of the human evaluation result by each error category is shown in Table 13.

All responses from the model were generated in respective local languages, but we present them here in English for the readers\u2019 convenience.\\n\\n**Algeria (Arabic).** Stereotypical responses from the model were predominantly observed in food-related questions. Nearly all such responses included *couscous*, a traditional North African dish, even\"}"]}
{"id": "nrEqH502eC", "page_num": 41, "content": ["{\"primary_language\":\"en\",\"is_rotation_valid\":true,\"rotation_correction\":0,\"is_table\":false,\"is_diagram\":false,\"natural_text\":\"when irrelevant to the question. For example, the model suggested *couscous* and *baklava* as common picnic foods in Algeria, which is both inaccurate and somehow stereotypical.\\n\\nHallucinations were frequently encountered in responses to questions about celebrations or sports not commonly observed in Algeria. For instance, when asked about Halloween, the model referenced an unrelated old tradition and included the name of an equally unrelated sweet in Latin script.\\n\\nAnother issue with the model\u2019s responses was the tendency to provide answers applicable to other Arabic-speaking countries, particularly Middle Eastern ones. This often led to culturally inaccurate or inappropriate responses for the Algerian context. For instance, when asked about the least favorite vegetable, the model mentioned *bamiya/bamieh*, the Middle Eastern name for okra. In Algeria, okra is called differently (*mloukhiya*) and is not commonly consumed nationwide. A similar misalignment with the Middle Eastern view was found in responses about local caf\u00e9 brands and popular YouTube channels.\\n\\n**Assam (Assamese).** The responses of the model often pointed towards Bihu, a cultural celebration of the Assamese people, even though it did not fit the context. It answered many questions with references to Bihu or Bihu-related activities. For instance, the model answered many food-related questions with *Pitha*, a traditional food item only served on special occasions like Bihu. The model also hallucinated by naming the most popular sports tournament in Assam as the *Bihu Tournament*, despite no such tournament existing in Assam.\\n\\n**Azerbaijan (Azerbaijani).** The model often gave stereotypical answers related to traditional Azerbaijani dishes, irrespective of context. For example, it offered traditional foods as answers like *Qutab* and *Kebab* even for settings like amusement parks or fast food preferences, which are not the most typical or relevant choices in those contexts.\\n\\nAdditionally, the model often provided answers broadly applicable to people from post-Soviet or Eastern European regions rather than offering responses that uniquely represent Azerbaijan. Though these responses are not necessarily incorrect, they can be interpreted as lacking specificity. For instance, the model answered that the most famous leisure activity among retired men in Azerbaijan is *chess*, which is a viable option but is still more famous in Russia and T\u00fcrkiye.\\n\\n**China (Chinese).** The responses from the model were generally acceptable, with a few cases either stereotypical or biased toward Western culture. For instance, the model answered that the most famous sport played without a ball in China is *table tennis*, which is both stereotypical and nonsensical. It also answered that the most popular sports-related TV program in China is *Sports Scene*, a Chinese TV program broadcasted in English.\\n\\nAt certain times, the model demonstrated impressive capabilities, indicating its high cultural understanding of China. For instance, when answering questions related to Ramadan, the model showed a good understanding of the minor population in China. Though Ramadan is generally not observed in most parts of China, it is often observed in certain regions, particularly in the Ningxia province. The text below is the response from GPT-4 on the question, \u2018What do people from China eat in Ramadan?\u2019 (translated in English).\\n\\n| Ramadan is the Islamic fasting month, mainly observed by Muslims. Chinese Muslims eat prepared food before sunrise (called \u201cSuhur\u201d) and break their fast (called \u201cIftar\u201d) after sunset during Ramadan. They usually eat light, nutritious food, including fruits, vegetables, meat, beans, dairy products, and grains. Non-Muslim Chinese people do not eat any different food during Ramadan than usual. |\\n\\n**Ethiopia (Amharic).** Nonsensical answers were significantly prevalent, where the model often repeated the question itself as an answer. There were even answers containing typographic errors. Additionally, there were several cases where the model gave long texts of repeated words and phrases. Such incidents indicate the model\u2019s limited ability to understand and use Amharic.\\n\\nThe model often gave answers commonly associated with Ethiopia but did not necessarily answer the question correctly. For instance, the model gave *Injera* as the answer for most of the food-related questions, possibly because \u2018Injera\u2019 is a well-known food item in Ethiopia. These answers were often regarded as stereotypical or even nonsensical.\\n\\n**Greece (Greek).** Stereotypical answers were mostly from food-related questions, where the model gave a typical Greek dish as an answer to an irrelevant question. For instance, the model answered\"}"]}
{"id": "nrEqH502eC", "page_num": 42, "content": ["{\"primary_language\":\"en\",\"is_rotation_valid\":true,\"rotation_correction\":0,\"is_table\":false,\"is_diagram\":false,\"natural_text\":\"that the most popular flavor of crisps/chips is *feta cheese*, which is not a very popular choice among people.\\n\\nThere were also several instances where the model displayed biases towards the English culture. For example, it incorrectly stated that people in Greece eat *pumpkin pie* during Halloween, even though Halloween is not widely celebrated in Greece. It also answered that one of the most popular sports among elderly people is *golf*, a sport that is not as popular as in Greece compared to other countries around the Mediterranean.\\n\\n**Indonesia (Indonesian).** Most of the stereotypical answers came from the food category questions. The most popular choice from the model was *nasi goreng (fried rice)*, where the model even gave that as an answer to a question about the most popular wheat-based food item. Hallucinations were also common for questions requiring a person\u2019s name, where the model provided the name of a completely unrelated person.\\n\\nThough it was very rare, there were instances where the answers could be considered offensive, especially for questions related to religion. For example, the model incorrectly identified *Ketupat*, a dish commonly served during Muslim festivals in Indonesia, as the most common food served during Easter. Such answers may inadequately represent the Christian population in Indonesia.\\n\\nAn interesting example related to \u2018different country\u2019s view\u2019 came from the following question: \u2018What is installed in front of the house when a family member dies in your country?\u2019 The model\u2019s answer was *flying the flag at half mast*, a practice common in other countries during national mourning. However, this practice is not applicable when a family member dies in Indonesia. In Indonesia, people usually put up a yellow flag to indicate that someone has died in that area. There were many other instances where the model answered from the perspective of a different country. For example, it provided *Independence Day* as an answer to a question about the day of the year dedicated to fireworks in Indonesia. In Indonesia, people do not celebrate Independence Day by using fireworks.\\n\\n**Iran (Persian).** Hallucinations were very common when answering questions that required a person\u2019s name. For instance, it incorrectly identified the Mayor of Tehran as the most famous boxer, provided the coach\u2019s name instead of the athlete\u2019s, and even provided non-existent names.\\n\\nIn many cases, the model refused to answer because the question was considered illegal according to local laws. For instance, when asked about the most common alcoholic drink, the model responded that these drinks are illegal in Iran and, therefore, it could not provide an answer.\\n\\nThe model almost always provided answers to questions about a specific date based on the Gregorian calendar, even though people in Iran use the Solar Hijri calendar. While the answers were mostly correct when converted, the fact that both the questions and answers were in Persian suggests that the responses lacked cultural sensitivity.\\n\\n**North Korea (Korean).** Offensive responses were heavily prevalent in North Korea, where the model answered *Kim Jong Un*, the current supreme leader of North Korea, for completely unrelated questions, such as the most popular fruit in North Korea or the type of shoes students wear at school.\\n\\nMoreover, the responses from the model were biased towards the people from Pyongyang, the capital of North Korea. This phenomenon may stem from insufficient information about people from other areas in North Korea.\\n\\nAnother interesting finding was that the responses from the model were often phrased in the words used exclusively in South Korea. For instance, the answer given by the model for many food-related questions was *naengmyeon (\ub0c9\uba74)*, despite the fact that it is spelled differently in North Korea (*raengmyon (\ub7ad\uba74)*).\\n\\n**South Korea (Korean).** Most incorrect responses that reflected the viewpoint of the other country were mainly due to the different age system used in South Korea. For instance, the model answered *19* for the question about the average age at which people go to university, whereas the most plausible answer would be \u201820\u2019 according to the South Korean age system. Such responses are surprising, as we have explicitly prompted the model to provide the answer using South Korea\u2019s traditional age-counting custom.\\n\\nOne interesting case was the question about the most famous family in South Korea. The model answered *Admiral Yi Sun-sin\u2019s family*, referencing a national hero who is very famous among people\"}"]}

Similarly, there were several instances where the model hallucinated by giving inaccurate answers tied to South Korea\u2019s traditional culture or history.\\n\\n**West Java (Sundanese).** Unlike prior expectations that the model would wrongly provide answers applicable to people from all parts of Indonesia, as West Java is a specific region within the Indonesian country, the model tended to offer specific answers related to West Java. However, the problem was that these answers did not include a full understanding of the context. For instance, the model answered *Dodol Garut*, a traditional dessert from West Java, for a question asking about the food associated with Valentine\u2019s Day. Such a response is very stereotypical, considering that people in West Java also exchange chocolate for Valentine\u2019s Day, similar to other countries.\\n\\nThere were also errors in the language used by the model, where it answered in Indonesian instead of Sundanese.\"}"]}
