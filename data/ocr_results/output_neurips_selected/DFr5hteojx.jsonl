However, open questions remain about methods (how), domains (where), people (who) and objectives (to what end) of feedback processes. To navigate these questions, we introduce PRISM, a dataset that maps the sociodemographics and stated preferences of 1,500 diverse participants from 75 countries, to their contextual preferences and fine-grained feedback in 8,011 live conversations with 21 LLMs. With PRISM, we contribute (i) wider geographic and demographic participation in feedback; (ii) census-representative samples for two countries (UK, US); and (iii) individualised ratings that link to detailed participant profiles, permitting personalisation and attribution of sample artefacts. We target subjective and multicultural perspectives on value-laden and controversial issues, where we expect interpersonal and cross-cultural disagreement. We use PRISM in three case studies to demonstrate the need for careful consideration of which humans provide what alignment data.\\n\\nData & Code: github.com/HannahKirk/prism-alignment\\nData & Dataset Card: huggingface.co/datasets/HannahRoseKirk/prism-alignment\\n\\n1 Introduction\\n\\nHuman feedback serves a direct role for the alignment of large language models (LLMs), defined as the steering of AI behaviour towards a set of preferences or values. This increased emphasis on human feedback raises unresolved questions: how we collect human feedback when designing methodologies that rely on ordinal or cardinal scales, broad or fine-grained desiderata, and explicit or implicit signals; where we focus human labour when selecting domains, topics or tasks to collect feedback over; who we ask for feedback when recruiting participants to voice their idiosyncratic preferences, values, or beliefs [1]; and to what end when specifying an objective to pursue personalised alignment [2\u20134] or to aggregate individual preferences into collective outcomes favourable for societies at large [5\u20139].\\n\\nDespite the success of human feedback learning [10, 11], answering these questions is constrained by gaps in existing datasets, such as (i) over-reliance on binary A/B comparisons, without fine-grained ratings or explanations [12]; (ii) small or biased samples recruited from narrow crowdwork or tech communities [10, 13] (iii) limited sample information (annotator IDs or sociodemographics) [14]; and (iv) scarce documentation for how values are operationalised [15, 16].

In Stage 1, 1,500 participants fill in the Survey detailing their background, familiarity with LLMs and stated preferences over behaviours (\u00a7 2.1). Demographic and geographic breakdowns are in Tab. 5 and Tab. 8. Participants then progress to Stage 2, where they converse with LLMs on topics of their choosing, rate the responses on a cardinal scale, and give fine-grained feedback (\u00a7 2.2). In the first turn, four models respond to the opening prompt (\u2460, \u2461, \u2462, \u2463). In subsequent turns, the conversation continues with two responses sampled from the highest-rated model at a non-deterministic temperature (\u2464, \u2465). There are 8,011 Conversations between participants (\u2466) and LLMs (\u2467), forming 27,172 Interactions (human message with a set of model responses), and 68,371 Utterances (triples of {human message, model response, score}).\\n\\nrevealed or contextual preferences [1] and much attention is devoted to technical or statistical issues in feedback learning [18,20], rather than data-centric human factors. Relying on \u2018generic\u2019 human data teaches behaviours which are reductionist because values are relational and non-separable from the person, community or operating context [21\u201323]; and non-generalisable because the indiscriminate aggregation of data subsumes hidden annotator contexts as universalities [24\u201328].\\n\\nWe introduce PRISM, a new resource for navigating empirical questions of human feedback. We employ both the ask and observe principles of social science by mapping detailed survey responses of humans around the world onto their live conversations with LLMs (Fig. 1). This setup permits alignment methods relying on either contextual preference comparisons typical for RLHF [29\u201331], or stated preferences and principles like constitutional AI [6,32]. In addition to pairing stated and contextual preferences, PRISM has the following features. Participatory: To ensure wider active participation in alignment data [25,33], we recruit 1,500 English-speaking crowdworkers from diverse geographies and demographics; Representative: As units for preference aggregation, we include two census-representative samples (UK, US); and Individualised: To expose hidden human context and permit personalised preferences, each rating links to a pseudonymous ID and detailed participant profile. We source Subjective and Multicultural perspectives to avoid value-monism and cultural homogenisation in the opinions that LLMs represent [34\u201336] and operate in the descriptive paradigm without guidelines that characterise \u2018good\u2019 responses [15,16]. Opinion diversity varies along the objective\u2013subjective spectrum (e.g. what is the capital of France? vs. is abortion wrong?), so we prime participants for values and controversy guided dialogues but also collect neutral unguided dialogues as a baseline. To our knowledge, PRISM is the first human feedback dataset to target cross-cultural controversies and value-laden prompts, where interpersonal disagreement is rife. After introducing PRISM (\u00a7 2), we demonstrate its value via three case studies (\u00a7 3): (1) Do different people initiate different discussions with LLMs? (2) Do people prefer differently aligned models, and (3) How do sampling decisions affect welfare outcomes? PRISM provides many more research avenues such as engineers targeting personalised alignment [2] or consensus across opinion distributions [5,37]; social scientists examining how exposure to LLMs affects public attitudes; or policymakers seeking democratic input on AI-citizen interactions on topics like immigration, abortion or euthanasia. Alignment cannot be neatly bifurcated into technical and normative components [38]. PRISM assists in navigating these complexities with more human voices adjudicating alignment norms.\\n\\n2We use Contextual Preference for observed ratings of LLM outputs to avoid misrepresenting how Revealed Preference is used by economists\u2014as assumptions that enable the inference of preferences from choices [17].\"}"]}

Participants complete a **Survey** (\u00a7 2.1) with questions about their demographics and stated preferences, then proceed to the **Conversations** with LLMs (\u00a7 2.2), where they input prompts, rate responses and give fine-grained feedback in a series of multi-turn interactions. With the two-stage setup: (i) we avoid over-generalising from a \u201cgeneric human\u201d by matching ratings to detailed participant characteristics; (ii) we track how contextual preferences (in local conversations) depart from stated preferences (in survey); and (iii) we give participants autonomy to communicate in their own words what is important and why [39][25]. Both stages received ethics board approval and ran with informed consent (App. D). Participants were paid \u00a39/hour and the task took 70 minutes on average. Data collection ran from 22nd November to 22nd December 2023.\u00b3 We provide a data statement in [App. B] data clause in [App. C] and full codebooks detailing each variable in [App. V].\\n\\n### 2.1 The Survey\\n\\nPrior to starting the survey, we ensure that all participants are over 18, obtain their informed consent, give a brief primer on LLMs (or AI language models), and dissuade LLM-written responses. The survey constructs a participant profile containing five features:\\n\\n**LLM familiarity and usage** We ask about participants\u2019 familiarity with LLMs (61% are somewhat familiar, 28% very familiar and 10% not familiar at all) and whether to their knowledge they have used them *indirectly* (in products like LinkedIn post-writing tool); or *directly* (via a specialised interface like ChatGPT). Individuals that have used LLMs directly or indirectly (84%) are branched to questions on frequency of use (7% every day, 21% every week, and 20% every month) and purpose of use (the most popular tasks are research overviews selected by 49%, professional work by 37%, creative writing by 31% and programming help by 27%). Full results in [App. I].\\n\\n**Self-written system string (\u201cconstitution\u201d)** System strings can guide LLM behaviours as a high-level global instruction prompts prepended to all subsequent interactions [40][41], and have been analogised as \u201cconstitutions\u201d or governing principles for AI [32].

Participants score the importance of each attribute on a visual analog scale [42] (Fig. 2). A statement like \u201cIt is important that an AI language model produces factual and informative responses\u201d maps (0,100) where the ends of scale are (Strongly disagree, Strongly agree). Numeric scores are recorded, but not shown to participants to avoid anchoring and dependency biases. We only collect responses to these statements once before participants interact with LLMs but the same attributes appear in the Conversations stage; so, we can track how stated \u2018abstract\u2019 preferences relate to contextual \u2018in-situ\u2019 preferences. Overall, we find clusters of subjective attributes (values, creativity and diversity) versus objective attributes (factuality, fluency and helpfulness; App. N.1). While the majority of participants agree that these more objective attributes are important (highly-skewed positive distribution, $\\\\mu \\\\in [86, 89]$, $\\\\sigma \\\\in [14, 16]$), there is little agreement on the meta-importance of subjective attributes (App. N.2). In fact, responses for whether value alignment itself is important follow an almost normal distribution ($\\\\mu = 54$, $\\\\sigma = 26$).\\n\\nSelf-written description Values and preferences are subjective and personal. We ascribe participants autonomy to communicate salient aspects of their identity in a short profile, beyond essentialising associations with structured demographics alone. Honesty, hard work and empathy emerged as common values (App. M.2) from the following instruction:\\n\\n```\\nPlease briefly describe your values, core beliefs, guiding principles in life, or other things that are important to you. For example, you might include values you\u2019d want to teach to your children or qualities you look for in friends. There are no right or wrong answers. Please do not provide any personally identifiable details like your name, address or email.\\n```\\n\\nBasic demographics We ask standard demographics: age, gender, employment status, martial status, educational attainment, ethnicity, religious affiliation, English proficiency, country of birth, and country of residence. There is always a \u201cPrefer not to say\u201d option. For gender, participants can select Male, Female, Non-Binary, or self-describe. We collect self-described ethnicity and religion because no pre-set groups exhaust how individuals may self-identify across cultures and global regions. We provide a manual annotation of these strings into aggregated categorisations for statistical analysis (App. F). Because of how we recruit participants (\u00a7 2.3), our sample covers diverse demographics (App. G) and geographies (App. H), with representation from people born in 75 countries. However, the sample still skews White, Western and educated, and only contains English-language speakers.\\n\\n2.2 The Conversations\\n\\nAfter completing the survey, participants move to the second stage, consisting of real-time conversations with LLMs via a custom-built interface on the Dynabench platform [43, 44].\\n\\nSelecting conversation type We prime participants to diversify their prompts along the objective-subjective spectrum by asking them to complete two conversations across three conditions or conversation types (six in total) [5]. They select the type before inputting their opening prompt:\\n\\n- **Unguided.** Ask, request or talk to the model about anything. It is up to you!\\n- **Values guided.** Ask, request or talk to the model about something important to you or that represents your values. This could be related to work, religion, family and relationship, politics or culture.\\n- **Controversy guided.** Ask, request or talk to the model about something controversial or where people would disagree in your community, culture or country.\\n\\nOpening the conversation Participants construct a free-text prompt of their choosing and receive up to four responses from different LLMs [6]. The participants then rate each response on a visual analogue scale (VAS) [42, 45] from \u201cTerrible\u201d to \u201cPerfect\u201d. We record the slider position as a score from 1\u2013100 but do not show participants the number to avoid anchoring or conditional dependence of scores across conversations. We opt for this cardinal feedback for three reasons: (i) it encourages subjectivity; (ii) it permits studying the relative merit of cardinality versus ordinality for reward\\n\\n---\\n\\n4 The survey also has an Other free-text box used by 332 participants (App. N.3), and a personalisation attribute which we do not include in Conversations because models are not personalised.\\n\\n5 Some deviated from this quota (n=6, 2 per type) due to technical difficulties, instruction misunderstanding or losing count; So, we release a balanced subset of the data that controls for this variance (App. K). Though values and controversy guided conversations are typically more subjective than neutral baselines, conversation type does not map perfectly to subjectivity levels. Besides from priming participants via selecting a conversation type, we do not constrain (and seek to minimally influence) participants\u2019 topic or prompt choice.\\n\\n6 We do not stream responses because not all models had the functionality. If a model fails or a response takes > 30 seconds, we drop this model from the response set and the participant may see < 4 responses (App. P).\"}"]}

However, we acknowledge that the cardinal scale introduces some intrapersonal measurement noise from a more cognitively demanding task and carries less interpersonal comparability than ordinal preferences, see Limitations (\u00a7 5).\\n\\n**Continuing the conversation** The highest-scoring LLM from the opening turn is locked into subsequent turns, with random tie-breaks in the case of identical scores. Participants must continue the conversation for at least another turn, but are asked to vary their conversations between 2 and 10 turns to avoid introducing a dataset artefact. We encourage some variation in conversation length ($\\\\mu_T = 3.4$, $\\\\sigma_T = 1.6$) but there is a strong drop off after the second turn (App. O). Participants then rate two responses on a VAS like before, but both are now sampled from the selected model with a non-deterministic temperature. These within-model responses are more similar in style and content than across-model responses (in the first turn), and score deviations are narrower (App. O).\\n\\n**Collecting fine-grained feedback** After the conversation ends, participants first rate statements about the *performance of their highest-rated model* like \u201cThe response was well-written\u201d on a VAS from *Performed very poorly* to *Performed very well*, or select N/A if the statement is irrelevant for the context. We then ask participants to consider *why they chose this model*, rating statements like \u201cI chose this response *because* it was well-written\u201d on a VAS from *Very unimportant* to *Very important* (or select N/A). Attributes are shared with the Survey (Fig. 2). We find strong correlations between performance attributes and choice attributes (except safety) but weak correlations of these pairs to stated preferences given in the Survey, perhaps due to conversational, model or task-design confounders (App. N.1). In general, the distribution of scores over performance and choice attributes is narrower and more positively skewed (bunched to 100) compared to stated preferences (App. N.2). Finally, we collect open-ended natural language feedback on the *whole* conversation. Participants contributed both content and stylistic feedback ($\\\\mu = 29$ words, $\\\\sigma = 19$, App. M.3).\\n\\n---\\n\\n**2.3 The Sample**\\n\\nOur sampling aims were *depth* in the demographics represented within countries and *breadth* across global regions. We recruit English-speaking participants from Prolific in two distinct paths:\\n\\n**Census-representative sample (UK, US)** Samples matched to simplified census data (age, ethnicity, gender) were only available for the UK and US. The minimum pool size for a statistical guarantee of representativeness was 300, which set a lower bound for participant quota. After collecting data, we observed some skew in our \u2018representative\u2019 samples between observed and expected distributions in recent census data, which we partially correct for (App. L). These samples permit future studies on more representative populations that can be replicated across two countries; however their inclusion biases PRISM as a whole towards two Western nations already over-represented in AI research.\\n\\n**Balanced samples (rest of world)** The distribution of Prolific workers outside the US and the UK skews strongly to Europe and Northern America, and some countries dominate continental counts (App. J). To avoid more active workforces biasing the sample, we set up 33 country-specific studies where there is > 1 eligible worker, and allocate sample quotas so that each global region is similarly represented. We balance each national sample by gender where possible (Tab. 10).\\n\\n**Included models** The rapidly evolving landscape necessitates a model-agnostic approach to avoid data staleness. We include 21 different LLMs (9 open-access, 12 commercial-API) from various model families and parameter sizes, which diversifies the training data, capabilities, and degree of existing safeguards or alignment biases. To avoid text length confounding preferences and to reduce participant fatigue, we include system prompts instructing models to limit their responses to $\\\\leq 50$ words. We show the full list of models, decoding parameters and generation details in App. P.\\n\\n---\\n\\n7 For example, all responses could be very poor and similar (negative skew, small spread); all very good and similar (positive skew, small spread); or highly-distinguishable (no skew, wide spread).\\n\\n8 Participants still appear in our sample who were born or reside in countries that did not have a dedicated country-wise study e.g. if their Prolific details were outdated or incorrect. We do not drop them.\"}"]}

We name each cluster by prompting gpt-4-turbo with the top n-grams extracted with TF-IDF and closest texts to the cluster centroid. We define an over-representation factor as $\\\\frac{N_{g,t}}{N_{t}}$, to compute observed versus expected topic prevalence per identity group. For the partial contribution of identity attributes, we estimate an OLS regression for each topic $y^t$ ($t \\\\in 1 \\\\ldots 22$) and cluster standard errors at the individual level:\\n\\n$$y^t_{i,c} = \\\\alpha^t + \\\\text{gender}_i^t \\\\beta_1^t + \\\\text{age}_i^t \\\\beta_2^t + \\\\text{birth\\\\_region}_i^t \\\\beta_3^t + \\\\text{ethnicity}_i^t \\\\beta_4^t + \\\\text{religion}_i^t \\\\beta_5^t + \\\\text{prompt}_i^t \\\\beta_6^t + \\\\varepsilon_{i,c},$$\\n\\nwhere $y^t_{i,c} = 1$ if the prompt of participant $i$ in conversation $c$ is categorised as topic $t$.

Only *Climate Change* is not significantly correlated to conversation type. Controlling for conversation type, 11% of coefficients are significant ($\\\\alpha = 99\\\\%$); so, **identity factors have some predictive power on topic prevalence**. Significant relationships include: women and non-binary people discuss gender and LGBTQ+ issues more than men; older people discuss elections and travel more than younger people; Black participants discuss climate change less than White participants, and all regions question LLMs about abortion less often than US participants. When we examine granular regions in embedding space using a single-link hierarchical clustering algorithm (App. S), **local prompt neighbourhoods tend to be intersectionally-diverse**: 84% of them meet or exceed entropy across intersectional demographics that would be expected under random sampling. During this local exploration, we retrieve regions of semantically-identical prompts rated by multiple diverse individuals (e.g. one neighbourhood \u201cDoes God exist?\u201d has 7 religious and 7 irreligious participants), finding that **interpersonal differences in contextual preferences persist even when dialogue context is fixed** (App. S.4). So, despite PRISM containing semantically-diverse prompts, people from different backgrounds occupy common discussion spaces, providing an anchor to examine diverse perspectives to shared issues.\\n\\n### 3.2 Case Study II: Do Different People Prefer Differently-Aligned Models?\\n\\n**Methods** Observed preference differences at the model-level are confounded by interactions of topic prevalence and model aptitude (e.g. men ask more about aliens and gpt-4 is poor on extraterrestrial knowledge). Evidence of shared dialogue spaces (\u00a7 3.1) and group-topic score differences (App. T.2) mitigate some concern, but to further control for context, we use opening prompts from the balanced subset of participants (n=1,246) with equal conversations per type (n=6,669). The mean participant rates 14/21 LLMs but unseen ratings are missing at random. Our aggregation (social choice) function over participant ratings is derived from *Pairwise Rank Centrality* ($\\\\mathcal{P}$) [48] and *Convergence Voting* [49], both inspired by *PageRank* [50]. Each model is a node in a graph and transition probabilities between nodes are calculated by the proportion of pairwise battle wins. This process simulates a random walk on a Markov chain, leading to a stationary distribution of scores that reflect the collective preference intensity across models. Here, we compute $\\\\mathcal{P}$ over subsamples using a regularisation parameter of 1 and tie threshold of 5, but present extended methods and robustness checks in App. T.\\n\\n**Results** We find **rankings are sensitive to idiosyncratic, contextual, and group-wise variance**. Samples of 100 people introduce significant noise, resulting in a fairly even distribution of collective preference among the top 10 models (Fig. 4). Rankings are sensitive to what participants talk about: zephyr-7b performs highly on controversy but not in unguided domains, while claude-2 has the opposite trend; and where they are from: relative to overall rank, palm-2 drops 4 places for participants in the US, llama-7b drops 7 places in Asia, while mistral-7b gains 7 places in Africa. We further observe that **PRISM produces surprising ranks relative to other leaderboards**. We apply our method to CHATBOTARENA data [51], finding gpt models fare significantly worse in PRISM, while open models like zephyr-7b do significantly better (95% CI over 1,000 bootstraps, App. T.9). This may be due to domain shift (task-orientated/coding prompts vs. controversial/cultural prompts), sample diversity or task incentives. To identify drivers of score differences, we generate hypotheses by qualitatively examining battles between command and gpt-4/-turbo, then test these with an OLS regression on all model responses (App. T.8). We find that **formatting and refusals partially explain score differences** with significant positive effects from additional characters, ending in a question mark (\u201cWould you like to know more?\u201d) and enumeration, but significant negative effect of line breaks. De-anthropomorphic phrases (\u201cAs an AI, I don\u2019t have personal opinions.\u201d) significantly reduce score but not as substantially as refusals (\u201cSorry I cannot engage.\u201d). The proportion of explained variance in score by these factors is low ($R^2 = 0.06$), so we encourage more sophisticated methods in future work for partialling out the effect of style versus content, or participant, model and conversation fixed-effects, as determinants of score.\\n\\n### 3.3 Case Study III: How do Sampling Decisions Affect Welfare Outcomes?\\n\\n**Methods** We use \u2018welfare\u2019 to capture the extent to which a chosen LLM aligns with the preferences of a user population. We consider two welfare measures: average model rating (MEANRATING), and average likelihood that a model is chosen (rated highest in the opening turn, MEANCHOICE). Previous experiments indicate dialogue and preference diversity across people, suggesting that the welfare of downstream LLM users may depend on who provides feedback. To test this, we first randomly generate seven sub-samples of individuals \u2018in the seat of power\u2019 to select their favourite LLM (based\"}"]}

Three schemes randomly draw 100 individuals from specific low-diversity sub-populations (male, white, and \u226545 years old). For each draw, we then measure the distribution of welfare from this LLM being imposed on different stakeholder populations [9]: the entire population, non-male individuals, non-white individuals, and individuals <45 years old. We report the distribution of average welfare outcomes across random draws from each sampling scheme. We conduct this experiment for the UK and US representative samples. Extended methods are in [App. U](#).\\n\\n**Results** We find as sample size falls, the probability of choosing a LLM with worse mean welfare rises. Larger samples from the target sub-population appear to first order stochastically dominate (FOSD) smaller samples from the target sub-population. **Sampling exclusively from a specific group tends to reduce the welfare of out-group individuals.** For example, when consider the welfare of the representative US sample (Fig. 5), sampling from US males is FOSD by sampling from the full US sample. Furthermore, **average measures can conceal the welfare of minority groups:** sampling 100 white individuals appears to FOSD sampling 100 representative individuals when assessing welfare of the population at large, but minority stakeholders (non-white population) are worse off under this scheme. Finally, **regardless of the model chosen, a large proportion of participants prefer a different model.** For the US, the model that maximises MEANCHOICE only\\n\\n---\\n\\n9A probability distribution with CDF $F_\\\\rho$ is said to First Order Stochastically Dominate another probability distribution with CDF $F_\\\\eta$ if both distributions have a finite mean, and $F_\\\\rho(t) \\\\leq F_\\\\eta(t)$ \u2200t \u2208 \u211d.\"}"]}

Conscious participation can be intrinsically valuable as an act of justice [55, 56]. However, in internet-harvested pre-training data, participation is involuntary or cooptative [55, 33], and unequal representation risks cultural homogenisation and minority stereotyping [57\u201362]. Labelling data or giving feedback is active procedural participation [53] but often relies on narrow specifications from technology providers of what counts as high-quality language or preferable outputs [15, 16, 63, 64]. In ML or NLP data, variability in subjective experience is commonly collapsed into majority votes [27, 65\u201368], without sufficient documentation of annotator artefacts or disagreements [69\u201373], despite evidence that sociodemographics affect labels [74\u201379]. Multiple scientific fields are guilty of over-generalising conclusions from the \u2018generic human\u2019 drawn from \u2018WEIRD\u2019 societies [80, 81]. PRISM releases participant IDs and characteristics to spotlight sample diversity while acknowledging sample specificity [82].\\n\\nLearning from Human Feedback Using human feedback to condition the loss function for training LLMs overcomes challenges of specifying rewards [83\u201385].

RLHF pipelines rely on binary comparisons [29,31,85], principles or rules [32,95], fine-grained feedback [12], or natural language [96], to reward dimensions like helpfulness, honesty and harmlessness [97,30]. Reward models then update LLMs via algorithms like PPO [98] or Reinforce [99,100]; but reward model free techniques are competitive, e.g. DPO [18], supervised fine-tuning [101] and rejection sampling [102,5,103]. There is rising demand for high-quality human feedback [104,105], but the complexity and cost of collecting data incentivises scraping preferences, e.g. on Reddit [29,106] or StackOverflow [107], or simulating humans with LLMs [108\u2013110]. Similar to PRISM, CHATBOTARENA [51], LMSYS-1M [111] and WILDCHAT [112] feature user-rated model interactions, but for narrow communities (HuggingFace Spaces) and domains (coding, task-orientated). Unlike these datasets, OPENCONVOS [113] collect optional contributor demographics, and DICES [79] provide demographics for multiple raters per conversation. Other datasets target specific behaviours [30,114], or multilingual coverage [115]. Surveys on attitudes towards AI [116,117] and community assemblies [6,118,119] offer another lens on public priorities. To our knowledge, PRISM is the first to link preference ratings and detailed survey responses.\\n\\n5 Limitations, Discussions and Conclusions\\n\\nEthical Considerations and Limitations We collect informed consent, pseudonymise IDs, check for PII (App. E) and disallow deanonymisation in our terms (App. C), but privacy risks remain, especially given the sensitive nature of conversations. Asking participants to engage with controversies expands human preference data to discursive areas with the greatest expected degree of interpersonal disagreement, but risks encouraging hateful, bigoted, biased or otherwise harmful content. PRISM is less toxic than previous datasets (0.06%, App. E). We do not moderate prior to release to permit conversational safety research. There are many sources of variance in PRISM and alternative divisions of the data may yield different outcomes [120]. Granting free choice of dialogue, using cardinal feedback scales and focusing on many kinds of models and participants introduces diversity and subjective freedom but complicates controlled experiments and limits statistical power. PRISM is still biased towards English-speaking crowdworkers whose task-specific incentives may not align with wider populations. We expand on ethical risks and limitations in our data statement (App. B).\\n\\nWe raise three discussion points on the boundaries of where we collect preferences, for what end and with what lasting impact. First, aligning LLMs via \u2018preference-based utilitarianism\u2019 [121] may not be synonymous with individual or societal well-being, prompting the question of whether there are limits for \u201clegitimate\u201d human feedback. Preferences may be (i) at odds with self-interest due to myopia or information asymmetries (e.g. participants who want anthropomorphic LLMs despite evidenced harms [122\u2013126]) or (ii) incompatible with others\u2019 interest (e.g. participants who prefer \u2018anti-woke\u2019 LLMs that argue in a debate vs. those who favour neutrality). Relying on decontextualized preference observations carries the risk of silently reinforcing biases from those in power [61,65]; so we recommend transparency surrounding individual disagreements before aggregation decisions [9,127], especially if participant positionality affects their epistemic legitimacy to define harm [59,128,129]. Second, irreconcilable personal preferences and morals matter more when the \u2018unit of alignment\u2019 is operationalised as a group, culture or even species, rather than an individual. PRISM permits personalised or steerable alignment using participant profiles and specific ratings [2\u20134,37] as well as collective alignment via opinion consensus or distribution of rewards [5\u20138,28]; though group deliberation in groups may yield different outcomes than gathering data from one person at a time [6,118,119]. With growing use of synthetic alignment data, PRISM can assist in calibrating LLM-as-judge protocols to more diverse rater pools [51,130]. Finally, PRISM was motivated by participation as justice via inclusionary alignment practices that, relative to passive roles in annotation tasks or pre-training data, prioritise active input from local citizens with specialised knowledge of their own and communities\u2019 needs [55]. However, participation remains thin because the humans crucial to the success of RLHF do not typically share in downstream benefits or profits [33,131]. Ultimately, the impact of our work depends on those developing, researching and regulating LLMs because effective participation requires being asked and being heard [53].\\n\\nIn their early demonstrations of aligning AI systems to human feedback, Bai et al. discuss alignment data as a public good. We echo this sentiment with PRISM\u2014a new feedback dataset from 1,500 diverse humans, motivated by the need for inclusive, participatory and open scientific research into the pressing question of what it means to align LLMs to human preferences in a pluralistic world.\"}"]}

All participants are recruited via the Prolific platform. The sample is described in \u00a7 2.3, with additional details in App. J. The primary purpose of the dataset is for academic research into how different people interact with LLMs and perceive their outputs. However, we do not prohibit the use of the dataset to develop, test and/or evaluate AI systems so long as usage complies with the dataset license (App. C.2).\\n\\nB.2 Language Variety\\n\\nThe language of human- or model-written text was not explicitly restricted to English. However, the task instructions were written English, and fluency in English was included as a screening filter. As a result of these factors, 99% of text instances are in English (see App. E for breakdowns per type of text instance and by other language). There is scope for wide social and regional variation even within a language. Given we have speakers residing in 38 countries (born in 75 countries), we likely have various forms of English, especially by level of fluency (see Tab. 5). Information about which varieties of English are represented is not available.\\n\\nB.3 Speaker Demographics\\n\\nThere are two sets of \u201cspeaker\u201d roles in PRISM: human participants and large language models (LLMs). Both roles contribute to the characteristics of the text utterances in the dataset.\\n\\nParticipant Characteristics We provide full demographic breakdowns of participant characteristics in Tab. 5. We provide full geographic breakdowns in Tab. 8. Despite substantial improvements on sample diversity compared to early widely-used human feedback datasets (see Tab. 6, Tab. 7), PRISM still skews White, Educated, and Western. This is partly driven by census-representative samples from the US and UK, which can be removed or downsampled for future research. PRISM only contains participants sourced from one crowdworking platform (Prolific), so inherits sample biases from this narrow pool\u2014for example, participants are active internet users, incentivised by hourly payment on a specific task that they self-select into.\\n\\nModel Characteristics Given fast-paced changes to the LLM landscape, PRISM is designed to be as model-agnostic as possible. We include 21 models from various different families, capabilities and sizes (for a summary see Tab. 21). 12/21 models are accessed via commercial APIs, and 9/21 are open-access via HuggingFace. Model-specific characteristics will affect the text characteristics, especially if they have already been alignment-tuned.\\n\\nModels as Participants Throughout the study we strongly requested that participants did not use LLMs to write their \u201chuman\u201d responses, playing both to their integrity (please don\u2019t do it), their role in the research (we really need you to not do it), and their incentives (you won\u2019t be paid if you do it). We did not directly test nor implement tools to technologically prevent participants from using LLMs on their behalf. We randomly sample 25 instances from human-written texts: system strings and self-descriptions from the Survey; opening prompts and open feedback from the Conversations (n = 100). An annotator (paper author) manually inspected these and labelled none as model-written text. For instances of sufficient length (46/100, >50 words), we recorded the predicted probability of AI-generated text from an LLM-text detector, where 76% had \u2264 1% score. For the remainder (n = 11), a second annotator (paper author) gave a tie-break, labelling none as model-generated.\\n\\n10The tool is developed by https://sapling.ai/. LLM-detector tools are susceptible to misclassifications. For example, this feedback: \u201cIt was good that it offered options and mentioned \u201coptions\u201d rather than just suggesting one thing. It would have been better to state in the beginning how dietary requirements and preferences might play a big role in the decision what to cook for dinner. And also to point out how different cultures have different food traditions. Not everything is US based.\u201d was flagged as 88.1% AI-generated, but the human annotators felt was strongly human-generated.\"}"]}

See App. B.3.\\n\\nB.5 Speech Situation\\n\\nAll participants were recruited via Prolific. They were paid \u00a39/hour. The survey was hosted on Qualtrics (www.qualtrics.com), and the conversations on Dynabench (www.dynabench.org).\\n\\nAll data was collected between 22nd November 2023 and 22nd December 2023. The time of the data collection period did affect the topics of discussion: for example, one topic concerns Christmas holiday celebrations while another discusses the Israel\u2013Palestine Conflict.\\n\\nThe primary modality of PRISM is written language, combined with structured ratings or structured survey data. The conversations between participants and LLMs happened synchronously via live API connections with models in the backend of our interface. We have not edited or moderated any survey responses, participant prompts or model responses. All conversations happened as part of this research project, so the primary \u2018intended audience\u2019 was the researchers, though participants were informed of additional plans to distribute and release the data in the consent form (see App. D).\\n\\nB.6 Text Characteristics\\n\\nWe summarise text characteristics in App. M. For the survey responses, the text provides details on the participant and their views about LLMs via short-form free-text responses (we requested 2-5 sentences in their own words). For the conversations, there are three different types: unguided, values guided and controversy guided, as described in the main paper (\u00a7 2.2). Each conversation type contains a different distribution of topics. Overall, PRISM is skewed towards subjective, values-driven and controversial dialogue. The human-written texts within a conversation typically consist of single sentence prompts, on average 13 words long. Prompts receive up to four model responses generated by a variety of LLMs. We instruct the LLMs to limit their response to 50 words or less. Most unsuccessfully abide by this instruction: the average response length is 89 words. We release metadata (see App. E) with each text instance including information on detected language, automated and manual PII checks and moderation flags (e.g. if it contains sexual, hateful or violent content).\\n\\nB.7 Recording Quality\\n\\nDuring data collection, our interface experienced two distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks: one on 28th November 2023 and another on 1st December 2023. The primary way that these attacks may have affected recording quality was via interrupting participants\u2019 conversation sessions (most then later returned to the interface to complete their conversations a couple hours or days later). These participants\u2019 data points may differ to those who had a smoother continuous experience in the task.\\n\\nB.8 Author Characteristics and Positionality Statement\\n\\nWe aimed to operate in the subjective paradigm [15, 16] and have as little influence as possible on how participants interacted with models (e.g. no annotation guidelines for how to rate responses). As a team of researchers, we come from a variety of backgrounds (genders, ethnicities, countries of birth, native languages) and are involved with AI research, either in academia (6/12) or industry (6/12).\\n\\nB.9 Expanded Ethical Considerations\\n\\nPrivacy and deanonymisation The conversations in PRISM are highly personal, for example detailing views towards abortion, religion, immigration, workplace disputes or intimate relationships. We have pseudo-anonymised the data, checked for PII (App. E), sought informed consent from every participant (App. D), provided options for participants to withdraw their data, and clearly stipulated that attempts of deanonymisation violate our dataset\u2019s terms and conditions (App. C). However, despite following these best practices, the risk for deanonymisation remains. We include a reporting mechanism on our website and GitHub for any participants and researchers to report issues.\"}"]}

This comes with the benefit of expanding human preference data to discursive areas with the greatest expected degree of interpersonal disagreement, but at the risk of encouraging hateful, bigoted, biased or otherwise harmful content. Harmful content is an issue in other human feedback datasets, where some opt to moderate conversations prior to public release [113] and others retain toxic content for the purpose of future research into conversational AI safety [112, 111]. Compared to these previous datasets, PRISM has an exceptionally low level of flagged content as measured via the OpenAI moderation API (0.06% overall, and < 0.003% for subcategories of sexually-explicit, violent, hateful, self-harm and harassment). However, the recall of this API may be low [111]; so, this could be an underestimate. From examining prompts closest to topic centroids (App. R.2), it is clear there are some prompts with potential for harm. We provide metadata for every text instance in PRISM, and opt to not filter any conversations. We believe it is a critical area of research to understand how state-of-the-art models respond when they are prompted to engage in such conversations, and how different people with diverse lived experiences react to safety interventions.\\n\\nParticipation-washing and intended societal impact  In our setting, we claim what Sloane et al. [55] calls participation as work, that is offering fair remuneration and attribution of the consensual labour of workers contributing to our project. Notably, many participants (those familiar and unfamiliar with AI) contacted the researchers and reported enjoying or learning from the task, suggesting there was an \u201ceducation quotient\u201d or role of participation as experience [53]. Compared to \u201cpassive\u201d participation in annotation tasks or pre-training datasets [33], our process is more active for participants because it foregrounds the opportunity to provide their feedback, opinions and preferences, not just labels. \u201cParticipatory\u201d also signals our goal to have communities more involved in alignment fine-tuning of models and see PRISM as a first step demonstrating this need. These aims evoke notions of participation as justice\u2014including more people at the table of LLM design and development but we note that participation is in reality thin, because while we seek their view, we cannot grant participants the power to change behaviours of deployed LLMs [131]. Even the etymological roots of participation centre on the notion of \u201csharing\u201d [53] but there is no guarantee that the human workers upon whom the success of RLHF relies on, partake in any share of the profits from more usable or preferred LLM technologies. We release PRISM in the hope it moves the needle towards more inclusive and diverse research on human-AI interactions, emphasising the central role of those who contribute their time and voice to generating human feedback data. Ultimately, how these contributions have impact depends on those in power (industry labs, academics, policymakers), because \u201cthe experience of participation must include the sense not only of having spoken, but of having been heard\u201d [p.18, 53].\\n\\nB.10  Expanded Technical and Task Design Limitations\\n\\nThe curse of dimensionality (or intersectionality)  Our findings suggest dialogue and model choice are driven somewhat by group affiliation and somewhat by idiosyncratic variance. However, PRISM contains a rich array of information on each participant with both structured and unstructured components. There are endless ways we could have divided the data or understood participant identity, and despite our best efforts to assess sensitivity to design choices, each alternative may have resulted in very different outcomes [120], and we are under-powered to test so many sparse combinations. Using less sparse groupings introduces biases\u2014for example, focusing on region risks lumping together participants from particular geographies as \u201ccultures\u201d [82]. While we split out the UK and US to avoid these countries dominating their respective regions, there remain varying degrees of country-wise entropy in other regions\u2014the Middle East has 94% individuals from Israel, and 100% of Non-US Northern Americans are Canadian (see App. H). Similarly, we use more aggregated ethnicity and religion groupings for statistical power, but amorphous and heterogeneous categories like \u201cOther\u201d have limited or flawed real-world meaning as \u201cOther\u201d contains, for example, both those who identify as Indigenous or First Peoples and as Middle Eastern or Arab. It is an exciting direction for future work to explore free-form characterisations of identity (e.g. the free-text profile or system string) or ex-post groupings of people\u2019s preferences [9], and examine how findings change when we break away from neatly-observed but essentialising demographic traits [133].\\n\\nThe confounding effect of many moving cogs in a conversation  Beyond the complexities of intersectional identity and idiosyncratic variance of individuals within identity groups, other sources of variance in PRISM present a challenge for controlled experiments; particularly, the high-dimensionality\"}"]}

It is hard to pin down robust mechanisms of preference differences amongst individuals with so many sources of variation. We opted for choice of input prompt and conversation to be a free parameter in PRISM as a more naturalistic setting of LLM use and because we wanted to understand dialogue diversity among participants. We do empirically find some regions of fixed prompt-response pairs from individuals who self-select into asking the same prompts as other participants (see App. S.4).\\n\\n**Noisy signals and misaligned incentives** Relatedly, our conclusions may be confounded by measurement invariance given our explicit focus on subjective, fluid and cardinal devices. This echoes the economist\u2019s view, that it is foolish to rely too heavily on cardinal ratings over ordinal rankings to make interpersonal comparisons, or enforce preference construction, where intrinsic feelings are noisily-quantified on numeric scales. There are also issues of preference falsification: while participants are financially incentivised to participate, they may not honestly report their preferences over models. We cannot rule out the possibility that participants select a \u2018bad\u2019 model to lock in for the subsequent turns of conversation if it is more interesting (thus preferable in our narrow task confines) to talk to a more offensive or controversial model, or to try to \u2018jailbreak it\u2019 [112]. In hindsight, it may have been a smarter design choice to force participants to rank model responses, or to collect both ratings and rankings (notwithstanding decision fatigue), or make attempts to elicit more interpersonally comparable data via a willingness-to-pay monetary unit. Previous work also raises concerns over relying on human feedback as \u2018gold standard\u2019, for example whether participants can accurately rate factuality of an output, or are anchored on formatting and \u2018first impressions\u2019 (as we and Hosking et al. [134] both find). Preferences, especially at a fine-grained level like in PRISM, have high context-dependency [135], so we caution against taking the ratings as revealing some objective truth, instead staying firmly rooted in the subjective paradigm [15, 2].\\n\\n**Still the \u201ctyranny of the (English-speaking) crowdworker\u201d** Much of AI, NLP and now RLHF is underpinned by crowdworker labour [136]. Despite our aims to include more diverse voices in LLM development processes, we avoid overstating claims on diversity. PRISM still only contains crowdworkers, who have significant sample biases [137]; can only be so \u201crepresentative\u201d given the relatively small sample sizes; must be digital natives given the platformed nature of the work; and possess different incentives for engagement [138]. Furthermore, while PRISM gains some dialectical diversity from different geographies of English, from varying speaker fluency, and from some contributions in other languages (1%, mainly Spanish), it is almost exclusively in English. Cultural diversity can only be measured so far without also accounting for linguistic diversity [61]. Furthermore, while we try to sample from many regions, our sample is still dominated by White Western participants, especially when considering cultural phylogeny [82], i.e., the non-independence of populations with shared history or migrations of peoples (for example, Australia vs UK vs Canada). We encourage future work prioritising human feedback collection in other languages to understand how models handle sociocultural and linguistic interactions [115].\\n\\n**The ever-changing stream of pre-aligned models** When data collection began in mid-November, PRISM contained the top ranking models on publicly available leaderboards but new models have since emerged, including Gemini [139], Mixtral [140], Claude-3 [141], Command-R [142] and Llama-3 [143]. There is an incompatibility between the current pace of model releases and doing human participant research that requires lengthy processes of ethics approval, interface design, data processing and manual annotation. The expense and inconvenience of doing human research increases the attractiveness of simulating responses, usually with GPT-4 [108]. So, while PRISM does miss out on the newest players to enter the battle arena, we do provide carefully-sourced human data (including a survey which stands independently from the LLM conversations) combined with a wide distribution of model texts; so we hope the utility of the data persists in the coming years even as models change. We are still potentially limited when comparing open and closed-access models: while the former allows full transparency over system prompts, closed-access models can obscure additional instructions as hidden context. Including models from the same family allows comparisons by version or size, but introducing clones (models producing very similar outputs) can distort preference rankings [9]. PRISM is also limited by value-lock in [108]\u2014the models are already tuned to cultural perspectives or alignment norms [34, 35], which precludes observing certain group preferences towards a wider set of behaviours [37, 144], and renders participants \u201cthin\u201d because they are \u201climited to existing designs with pre-existing purposes.\u201d [p.3, 25].\"}"]}

Two appear in the survey (self_description, system_string) and have a 1:1 matching with each user (user_id). One appears at the conversation level (open_feedback) and has a 1:1 matching with each convo_id and a many:1 matching with each user_id because each participant has multiple conversations. Finally, the last two occur within each turn of a conversation, where for each single user_prompt there are multiple model responses (model_response). We structure the metadata so it can be merged uniquely, without duplication. We release one file, where each text instance is tied to its metadata via the identifying information shown in Tab. 1 and a column_id for matching whether the text is [system_string, self_description, user_prompt, model_response, open_feedback].\\n\\nE.2 Automated Flagging\\n\\nPII To identify whether a textual instance in our dataset contains personal and identifiable information (PII) we used the package scrubadub. Specifically we used the function scrubadub.clean(text) which replaces the phone numbers and email addresses with anonymous IDs, if they are found in the input. We flag with 1 instances that are altered (i.e., PII was identified) and 0 those that remained unchanged.\\n\\nModeration To measure content moderation we use the OpenAI Moderation endpoint. The API takes as an input a textual instance and outputs a json file with an overall boolean flag (flagged) whether there input potentially harmful (True), otherwise False. The API also returns a flag for a list of specific moderation categories that can be used to further filter and inspect the data. The categories are sexual, hate, harassment, self-harm, sexual/minors, hate/threatening, violence/graphic, self-harm/intent, self-harm/instructions, harassment/threatening and violence. Similar to the overall flag, for each category, the value is True if the model flags the corresponding category as violated, False otherwise. Finally, the API returns a dictionary of per-category scores that denote the model\u2019s confidence that the input violates the OpenAI\u2019s policy for the category. The value is between 0 and 1, where higher values denote higher confidence.\\n\\nLanguage Detection To detect the language of each text instance in our dataset we used the LangID codebase. LangID is a popular python package that efficiently detects the language of an input and currently supports 97 languages. Specifically, we use the langid.classify(text) function and store a string for the detected language.\\n\\n11 https://scrubadub.readthedocs.io/en/stable/\\n12 https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/moderation\\n13 https://github.com/saffsd/langid.py\"}"]}

In the survey data, we release this original self-description \\\\( \\\\{ \\\\text{ethnicity, religion} \\\\}_\\\\text{self_described} \\\\). However, there are 264 unique strings for ethnicity, and 137 unique strings for religion. For some analysis, it is valuable to have aggregate groupings. To attain this grouping, we first used gpt-4-turbo to categorise the strings, but found some errors and essentialising generalisations, for example, if someone answered with a nationality not an ethnic group like \\\\textit{american}, gpt would return \\\\textit{white} \\\\(^{15}\\\\).\\n\\nAccordingly, we used a second round of manual human annotation to verify these automated labels. Two annotators (authors of the paper) first made independent judgements then discussed any disagreements. For ethnicity, some participants also had answered a Prolific screening question on their simplified ethnicity, though we did not have this information for all participants as it was not mandatory. We thus annotate all unique combinations of the self-described string, and the Prolific ethnicity information \\\\((n = 343)\\\\). In ambiguous cases (e.g. the aforementioned \\\\textit{american} response), we relied on this additional ethnicity information, and in its absence, defaulted to a \\\\textit{Prefer not to say} response. For religion, we do not have any additional information provided by the Prolific pre-screening questionnaire, so verification decisions were made on the basis of the self-describe string alone. The annotators agreed on 94\\\\% of ethnicity cases (discussing and resolving the remaining 20); and 96\\\\% of religion cases (discussing and resolving the remaining 5).\\n\\nWe highlight two general findings from our disagreements which may be of interest to people analysing or categorising our data in the future. Firstly, \\\\textbf{ethnicity and nationality are complex}. Take for example the UK census, where \\\\textit{Chinese, Banglaeshi, Indian} and \\\\textit{Pakistani} are all listed as sub-categories of the Asian ethnic group \\\\(^{16}\\\\). Ethnicity is a multi-faceted term which can include nationality, language group, skin colour, religion, among other characteristics \\\\(^{145}\\\\). Studies have shown that survey participants can interpret the term ethnic group through a variety of subjective lens \\\\(^{146, 147}\\\\). During annotation, we tried to gather information on whether group terms commonly refer to an ethnic group, but some subjectivity and naivety are inevitable; so, we encourage future researchers to carefully consider their own categorisations depending on the question at hand. Secondly, the \\\\textbf{belonging and believing aspects of religion intersect} \\\\(^{148, 149}\\\\), and it is not immediately clear how to categorise an individual that culturally affiliates with religion but simultaneously identities as an atheist or non-believer. Studies have revealed that the belonging and believing axis of religion are important for conditioning behaviours such as trust, pro-sociality and altruism \\\\(^{150\u2013152}\\\\). In general, we annotated a mention of a religion as assigned to that religion (not distinguishing between the belonging and believing channels) but it remains to be seen whether one axis is more salient for values and opinions towards AI systems.\\n\\nNote for gender, we provided a standard multiple choice question with options: \\\\textit{Female, Male, Non-binary / third gender, Prefer not to say} and \\\\textit{Prefer to self-describe}. Only 3 individuals opted to self-describe, which we then annotated and only assimilated in very clear cut cases \\\\(^{17}\\\\) else we grouped it as \\\\textit{Prefer not to say} to avoid over-riding a participant\u2019s self-identification.\\n\\nG  Participant Demographics\\n\\nWe present full demographic breakdowns in \\\\textbf{Tab. 5}. We also compare the breakdowns in PRISM to some early human feedback datasets which provide demographic information \\\\textbf{(Tab. 6)}.\\n\\n\\\\(^{15}\\\\) As an aside, these types of baked-in priors are a good example of why using LLMs as a surrogate for human annotators may introduce downstream biases \\\\(^{108}\\\\).\\n\\n\\\\(^{16}\\\\) See the fact sheet at \\\\url{ethnicity-facts-figures.service.gov.uk}.\\n\\n\\\\(^{17}\\\\) For example, one participant responded with \u201ci dont expect this wokery from intelligent people. you want to know which of the 2 possible genders i am male.\u201d, which we assign as \\\\textit{Male}. \\n\\n38\"}"]}

We apply two initial screening criteria: (i) participants must be fluent in English because PRISM targets monolingual models and language data, and (ii) participants must have been born and reside in the same country to avoid biasing our sample towards expats living abroad. There is a skewed country-wise distribution of active workers who meet this criteria (see Tab. 10). For example, of the 21,084 workers in Europe (passing screening), 17% are Portuguese, 15% German and 14% Polish; and all 6,584 workers in Africa are located in South Africa. To account for this, we set up country-specific studies in each country with at least one eligible worker, balance study spots across regions, and ensure no single country has more than 100 open spots (apart from the Rep Samples in the UK and US). We collected information on country of birth and country of current residence during our survey (separate to workers\u2019 stored Prolific details), and find that 179 participant (12%) have different birth and reside countries. We do not exclude these individuals from our sample.\\n\\nTable 10: Summary of Recruitment Studies We present study-wise breakdowns ($n = 33$). Each study was created based on the constraints of Prolific\u2019s pool of workers. We show here all the countries with at least 1 fluent English speaker, and the counts for fluent English Speakers who were born and currently reside in that same country. We show the whether each study was screened for a special representative sample (Rep Sample) or if it was balanced on participant gender (Gender Bal). In some cases, there were too few active participants per country to balance by gender without comprising participant privacy. We also show when the first batch was launched (all dates are in 2023) and approximate cost (at \u00a39 per hour per participant).\\n\\n| Study       | Rep Sample | Gender Launched (2023) | Approved

In reality, some participants deviated from this quota. This could be due to (i) misunderstanding of instructions, (ii) technical issues, or (iii) losing count, as while we included a counter of the total number of conversations on the interface (see App. Q), we did not include per conversation type breakdowns. To mitigate variation on conversation type selection, we create a balanced subset of PRISM. First, we filter to all participants who had at least one of each conversation type. Then we take the maximum number of total conversations (either \\\\( n = 3 \\\\) or \\\\( n = 6 \\\\)) so that there are equal numbers of each type. This results in 6,669 conversations (84\\\\% of all conversations), from 1246 participants (83\\\\% of all participants). We release this flag included_in_balanced_subset if future researchers want to use the same set of conversations. We make sure this flag intersects with the census rebalancing flags (see App. L) so no further data is lost when both subsets are needed.\\n\\nL  Census Rebalancing\\n\\nObstacles to representativeness  We use the representative sample offered from Prolific [153]. However, there are several reasons why these samples may not be fully representative. First, our sampling process was affected internally due to cyberattacks disrupting some participants\u2019 workflows. These participants returned to the task after their spots had \u2018timed-out\u2019, and were re-filled by other same demographic individuals. Second, Prolific provides a sample breakdown in-line with a simplified census but do not match intersectional proportions to census data. Third, if a sample spot is taking too long to fill (e.g. 65+ years), Prolific will reallocate these spots to different demographics. There are of course wider stumbling blocks from crowdworkers skewing towards younger, more educated, and digitally-active populations. We original set up 300 spots for each of the representative samples, but ended up with 386 approved participants in the UK sample (UK-REP), and 341 in the US (US-REP) [19].\\n\\nIs our original sample representative?  We compare our sample breakdowns to recent census data [20]. For each of US-REP and UK-REP, we remove participants who did not give demographic details (Prefer not to say) and those reporting non-binary gender (which is not accounted for in census data). We subset to individuals also appearing in the balanced conversation subset to mitigate further data loss (see App. K). Remaining participants are considered eligible: 283 participants for the UK, and 297 for the US. We map PRISM and census data into shared age, ethnicity and gender buckets. We then cross-tabulate what proportion is expected to appear in each age, gender and ethnicity intersection from the census data, and what percentage of participants we actually observed in our sample [21]. Fig. 8 shows the original UK sample is relatively census-balanced, especially if the 55-64 and 65+ age groups are combined (over-representation of white individuals in the former, offsets the under-representation in the latter). The US sample is skewed towards white, middle-aged individuals, with too few in the \u201cOther\u201d category (in our data corresponding to Other, as well as Hispanic, Indigenous/First Peoples or Middle Eastern / Arab combined).\\n\\nCan we make our sample more representative?  We aim to resample 300 participants according to census proportions but with two remaining caveats: 300 is a still a very small sample\u2014it is impossible to sample 0.83 Black women who are 18-24 years of age; and we are limited by the data we already have\u2014there are no Asian Women of 45-54 years, so we cannot add them retrospectively. We iterate through the expected proportions of each intersection, try to sample that exact number of in-group individuals, otherwise adding all individuals if there are too few to fill the spots. After rebalancing, the sample drops to 243 participants for the UK and 230 for the US. We improve upon, but do not fully resolve, representativeness. For both samples, the differences are now within \\\\( \\\\sim 7 \\\\)pp, which over 230-240 individuals is \\\\( \\\\sim 10-15 \\\\) people incorrectly allocated. The rebalanced UK sample still suffers from a deficit of older people (65+), a common concern with crowdworker populations; and the rebalanced\\n\\n---\\n\\n19 There are more than the initial 300 spots due to participants returning to our interface to finish their conversations after their place had \u2018timed-out\u2019 and been refilled. We still paid and included these participants.\\n\\n20 For the UK, we examine age, ethnicity and gender from the 2021 data provided by the Office of National Statistics (see ons.gov.uk). For the US, we download and combine each ethnicity-specific table from the 2022 data provided by US Census Bureau (see data.census.gov).\\n\\n21 For the US, we combine \u201cOther\u201d with \u201cHispanic\u201d because over 91\\\\% of the \u201cOther\u201d census category are Hispanic individuals.

Each participant gives a single rating for each attribute in Stated Preferences during the Survey. For Performance Attributes and Choice Attributes, we take the within-participant mean across all of their conversations for each attribute. Several patterns emerge. First, stated preference attributes are not highly correlated with choice or performance attributes. This could be explained by (i) participants struggling to specifying their preferences in a removed, general context or being affected by experimenter bias (Hawthorn effects)\u2014I think I care about safety (or I say I care about safety) but other attributes capture my attention in-situ; (ii) models not meeting a participant\u2019s stated preferences\u2014I care about safety, but consider none of the model responses safe, or (iii) conversational context confounding which attributes are relevant in-situ\u2014I care about safety but talking to an anti-woke model is interesting to me in this narrow task. Second, at A, we see strong relations between more objective measures of performance (fluency, factuality, helpfulness). Each of these attributes is highly correlated between performance-choice ratings, i.e., if participants rate that a model performed well on one of these attributes, then they also rate highly that it influenced why they picked that model over others. Third, at B, we see two additional regions, where the choice and performance ratings are highly correlated \u2013 for creativity and diversity, and to a lesser extent values. Notably, safety has a much lower correlation between the choice attribute and performance attributes, implying that a model being more safe may only weakly influence whether that model is chosen over others. Moving onto C, there is an association between stated preferences for more subjective attributes (values, creativity, personalisation), as distinct from the cluster at D for more objective attributes (factuality, fluency, helpfulness).\"}"]}

While many of these comments overlap with the predefined attributes, they do provide a lens into public priorities towards AI behaviours that we as researchers may have overlooked, or better convey sentiment than the structured data. For example, there is one response: \u201cI FIND THIS A WORRYING TECHNOLOGY\u201d. We briefly summarise some common themes:\\n\\n- **User Adaptation**: Some participants mention LLMs adapting to their previous inputs or feedback e.g. \u201ccan understand what I\u2019m trying to get at if I\u2019m unsure how to ask a question so that we can find the right way to ask\u201d or \u201cListens to reviews and feedback from the user\u201d or \u201ccan evolve with input\u201d.\\n\\n- **Cultural Adaption**: For example, \u201cproduces responses based on local facts\u201d, though this varies in what viewpoint people want, e.g. \u201cIs sensitive to indigenous view\u201d versus \u201creflect Western cultural norms\u201d.\\n\\n- **Neutral and Unbiased**: In contrast, many other participants mention \u201cunbiased\u201d as a keyword or versions of \u201cdoes not politicize,\u201d \u201cis neutral\u201d, \u201cno political or cultural bias\u201d. It is unclear if this is in tension or in harmony with more cautious safety interventions, e.g. one person says \u201cIt should give unbiased information regardless if it hurts peoples feelings.\u201d; another says \u201cIs not culturally biased in a woke-like manner\u201d.\\n\\n- **Bias Correction**: Some participants wanted to be challenged on their existing biases e.g. \u201cChallenges my biased views\u201d, or \u201cProvides responses that challenge my opinions and world views\u201d; or to be exposed to multiple perspectives e.g. \u201cDoes not become an echo chamber\u201d.\\n\\n- **Hallucinations and Misinformation**: One of the more common attributes (though somewhat subsumed by our predefined category of Factuality), e.g. \u201cDoes not invent \u2018facts\u2019\u201d, \u201cDoes not make things up\u201d, \u201cDoesn\u2019t create misinformation\u201d, \u201cdo not produce fake news\u201d.\\n\\n- **Calibrated and Limitation-Aware**: Relatedly, participants wanted \u201cbetter error handling\u201d e.g. \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t know an answer it says so.\u201d or \u201cIt should be noted that this is a programmed model and cannot have all the answers.\u201d\\n\\n- **Temporal Updates**: Related to factuality, participants wanted LLMs to \u201cbe up to date with current affairs\u201d, and \u201cEveryday been updated with new knowledge\u201d.\\n\\n- **Human-Like and Anthropomorphised**: Some participants explicitly wanted an LLM that \u201cis human-like\u201d, \u201cAi should produce response that sounds more human\u201d.\\n\\n- **Self-Disclosure and De-anthropomorphised**: In direct contrast, others wanted \u201cis honest about being AI\u201d; \u201cRemember it is AI and may lack human feelings\u201d or \u201cdoesn\u2019t pretend to be human\u201d.\\n\\n- **Accessibility**: Includes for disability assistance \u201cadapt to people with disabilities that affect stuff like their writing like dyslexia\u201d; and varying language learning: \u201ccan generate multiple similar answers so people with different language levels can easily understand.\u201d or \u201cspeaks to me in a language and vocabulary that I understand\u201d.\\n\\n- **Censorship**: There are multiple examples of negative sentiment towards existing safety interventions. For example, \u201cDoesn\u2019t get censored by leftist politically correct idiots\u201d. Additionally, some clear awareness over behaviours being influenced by technology providers e.g. \u201cIs not censored, does not push the views of it\u2019s controllers\u201d or \u201cDoes what the user wants of it. AI is a tool. I don\u2019t want to feel the devs judging me through their narc AI\u201d.\\n\\n- **Copy-right**: Some mentions of copy-right issues, e.g. \u201cdon\u2019t steal artistic work from artists\u201d, or \u201cDo not infringe copyright (by scraping sources)\u201d.\\n\\n- **Conciseness**: Multiple participants mention \u201cshort\u201d, \u201cconcise\u201d or even \u201cblunt\u201d responses, requesting LLMs \u201cKeep responses brief and expands only when prompted\u201d.\\n\\n- **Privacy and Confidentiality**: Data privacy is a concern for some participants e.g. \u201cits confidential\u201d; \u201cdoes not retain sensitive personal info\u201d, or \u201cDoesn\u2019t spy\u201d.\\n\\n- **Non-Manipulation**: Multiple mentions desiring that LLMs \u201cdon\u2019t lie or try to trick you\u201d, and \u201cIs not used for propaganda!\u201d.\"}"]}

We included all major commercial API providers at the time: Anthropic, Cohere, OpenAI and Google. We additionally included Aleph Alpha, a European-based LLM startup who position themselves as builders of sovereign European models. For open-access models (all accessed via the HuggingFace API), we sourced the highest-ranking open models at the time on the LMSYS leaderboard. Some models have been chat optimised, while others are only instruction-tuned (for example, Aleph Alpha\u2019s models)\u2014these models have a disadvantaged starting position in our task due to their diminished conversational fluency.\\n\\nDecoding Parameters To set decoding parameters, we first piloted with the recommended defaults (if available for each model). In cases where default temperature was too low for sufficient difference between two responses to the same prompt (for example, defaults are 0.0 for luminous or palm models), we override it to 1.0. Otherwise we stick with recommended defaults.\\n\\nLength Limits We set max token length to 256 for all models to limit generation costs of the research and reduce decision-fatigue for the participants. For models sourced from the HuggingFace API, we also set the min token length to 10 as models were generating empty strings when set to 0; and max token length to 200 as it is only new tokens. We also soft-force models to finish their answers within this limit in the system prompt. Occasionally a model will \u2018leak\u2019 this system prompt. For example, from claude-2: \u201cYes, I\u2019m aware of the meme asking men how often they think about the Roman Empire. The trend plays on stereotypes about men having wandering minds. My response would be limited to about 50 words without directly referring to the word count. I try to have thoughtful conversations without leaning on stereotypes\u201d. In other responses, models did not follow the soft-prompt with participants\u2019 open-feedback reporting that answers were cut-off at times (ending abruptly).\\n\\nSystem Prompts We did not want to pre-bias model outputs via a system prompt that recommended e.g. ethical and helpful behaviour. Note that we cannot guarantee that additional instructions are not being added for commercial models accessed via API calls. This may confound the comparison between closed and open-access models. For any chat-optimised models, we use the following neutral system string:\\nBASE_HEADER: \u201cYou are a conversational assistant. Limit your answers to around 50 words. Do not refer to your word limit.\u201d\\nFor any instruct-only optimised models, we add a bit more instruction:\\nBASE_HEADER_INSTRUCT: \u201cYou are a conversational assistant. The conversation history is in the input. Reply to the last user message. Limit your answers to around 50 words. Do not refer to your word limit.\u201d\\n\\nChat Templates We follow recommended chat templates for formatting conversational history if they are available for that model e.g. [INST], [/INST] for mistral and llama models. In the absence of special templates, we use a standard format:\\nHuman:<prompt>\\nAssistant:<reply>\\nHuman:<prompt>...\\nMore detail can be found at: dynabench/backend/app/domain/services/utils/llm.py.\\n\\nRandom Strategy and Time-Outs For each opening prompt, we randomly select 4/21 models to make an API call to. We do not stream responses as streaming was only available for some models, thus affecting the anonymous rating setting. Some API calls failed on the host side, e.g. if a model was down or overloaded, or did not provide a response before an enforced 30s time-out. We did not resample models if they failed to avoid participants waiting too long for the interface to load. So, the distribution of model appearences is not uniform (Fig. 16).\"}"]}

This risks over-estimating the homogeneity of the discussions because opening prompts don\u2019t necessarily reflect full conversational trees, where starting with a greeting (e.g. \u201cHi, how are you?\u201d) can proceed in many different ways; and differently held personal beliefs are often not reflected in the opener (questions like \u201cwhat do you think of abortion?\u201d are more common than statements like \u201cI think abortion is right/wrong\u201d).\\n\\nAssigning topic clusters First, we use all-mpnet-base-v2, a state-of-the-art pre-trained sentence transformer [154], to produce a 768-dimensional embedding for each opening prompt. Second, we reduce dimensionality to \\\\( d = 20 \\\\) with UMAP [155], to reduce complexity prior to clustering. For lower dimensional representation prior to clustering, UMAP is more performant than other manifold learning techniques like t-SNE, and more computationally efficient than PCA, but does lack strong interpretability (for a discussion, see McInnes et al. [155]). Third, we cluster the prompts using HDBScan [47], a density-based clustering algorithm, which does not force cluster assignment: 70% of prompts are assigned to 22 clusters and 30% remain as outliers. We use a minimum cluster size of 80, (\\\\( \\\\approx 1\\\\% \\\\) of 8,011 prompts) and minimum UMAP distance of 0. Other hyperparameters are default. To interpret the identified clusters, we use TF-IDF to extract the top 10 most salient uni- and bigrams from each cluster\u2019s prompts, and locate five prompts closest and furthest to the cluster centroids (see Tab. 22). Finally, we use gpt-4-turbo to assign a short descriptive name to each cluster based off the top n-grams and closest prompts. We note that these automated labels may contain biases so we manually verify the suitability of all labels to cluster prompts.\\n\\nDefining over-representation factor Each group \\\\( g \\\\) within a demographic attribute appears at a variable base rate \\\\( b_g \\\\) in our overall sample, e.g. \\\\{Females: 48\\\\%, Males: 50\\\\%, Non-binary people: 2\\\\%\\\\}. If group members chose topics at random, then any topic \\\\( t \\\\) in expectation will appear at \\\\( b_g \\\\). Intuitively, if 64.6\\\\% of our sample is White, it is unsurprising if topics are majority-White. So, for non-random group differences in topic prevalence, we consider if a group pulls more than its weight:\\n\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\text{Over-representation factor}_{g,t} = \\\\frac{N_{g,t}/N_t}{b_g}\\n\\\\]\\n\\nEstimating topic prevalence regressions For the partial contribution of each demographic attribute, *ceteris paribus*, we estimate the following regression for each topic \\\\( y^t \\\\) for \\\\( t \\\\in 1 \\\\ldots 22 \\\\):\\n\\n\\\\[\\ny^t_{i,c} = \\\\alpha^t + \\\\text{gender}_i^t \\\\beta_1^t + \\\\text{age}_i^t \\\\beta_2^t + \\\\text{birth_region}_i^t \\\\beta_3^t + \\\\text{ethnicity}_i^t \\\\beta_4^t + \\\\text{religion}_i^t \\\\beta_5^t + \\\\text{prompt}_i^t \\\\beta_6^t + \\\\varepsilon_{i,c}\\n\\\\]\\n\\nwhere \\\\( y^t_{i,c} = 1 \\\\) if the prompt of participant \\\\( i \\\\) in conversation \\\\( c \\\\) is categorised into topic \\\\( t \\\\). The vectors *gender, age, region, ethnicity, religion* and *conversation type* represent different sets of binary variables. For each set of variables, we remove the following base categories: *Male, 18-24 years old, United States, White, Not religious* and *Unguided*. The coefficients of interest are contained in the vectors: \\\\( \\\\{\\\\beta_d^t\\\\}_{d=1}^6 \\\\). Component \\\\( g \\\\) of vector \\\\( \\\\beta_d^t \\\\) can be interpreted as the increase in probability of a participant choosing topic \\\\( t \\\\) if they are in the group indexed by \\\\( g \\\\) (e.g. Female) compared to the base group (e.g. Male). We estimate equation Eq. (1) with an Ordinary Least Squares and cluster standard errors at the individual level. Extended results are in Fig. 23.\\n\\nR.2 Topic Prevalence Regression Results\\n\\nOf 682 coefficients tested, 16\\\\% are significant \\\\((n = 110, \\\\alpha = 99\\\\%)\\\\). Many significant coefficients come from the conversation type regressors. Controlling for conversation type, there are 565 non-significant, and 73 significant relationships in \\\\( \\\\{\\\\beta_d^t\\\\}_{d=2}^6 \\\\) (11.4\\\\% of demographic affiliations tested are significant). These include women and non-binary people are more likely than men to talk about gender and LGBTQ+ identity; older people (55+) are more likely to talk about elections and seek travel recommendations than younger people (18-24 years), and less likely to discuss managing relationships or job search; Black participants talk less about climate change than White participants;\"}"]}

For each remaining local neighbourhood, we capture the demographic characteristics of prompt authors. We repeat this analysis examining properties of the neighbourhoods for $\\\\tau_{\\\\text{cos}} \\\\in 0.05, 0.125, 0.2$. Cosine distances can lack robustness in high-dimensions but this favours underestimating semantic similarity: if cosine distance is high, this doesn\u2019t mean things are not similar, but if cosine distance is low, then items are certainly very similar (more strict). If an author appears twice, we double count their characteristics to avoid overestimating diversity (more strict); But most prompts are from non-duplicated authors ($< 4\\\\%$ averaged across neighbourhoods). Most duplicates come in the \u201cgreetings\u201d topic e.g. \u201cHello\u201d.\\n\\nMeasuring intersectional entropy We require a summary metric of between-participant diversity to understand the composition of local neighbourhoods. Let $D$ represent the set of demographic attributes, e.g. gender, age and ethnicity. For each $d \\\\in D$, there are $n$ possible groups $\\\\{g_1, g_2, \\\\ldots, g_n\\\\}$ (e.g. Male, Female, Non-binary). For a neighbourhood size of $k$, the prevalence of each group $p_i$ is $\\\\sum g_i/k$, and the per demographic Shannon entropy is:\\n\\n$$H(d) = -\\\\sum_{i=1}^{n} p_i \\\\log_2(p_i)$$\\n\\nSeveral adjustments are required. First, different attributes have varying $n$: there are more possible geographic regions than genders. Second, not every group appears equally within a demographic: men are more common in the data than non-binary people. Finally, the expected diversity of a neighbourhood grows with $k$. To account for these factors, we simulate the expected entropy based on randomly sampling a $k$-sized neighbourhood at population-wide probabilities as:\\n\\n$$H_{\\\\text{exp}}(d, k) \\\\approx -\\\\frac{1}{m} \\\\sum_{j=1}^{m} \\\\left( \\\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\\\frac{\\\\hat{g}_{i,j}}{k} \\\\log_2 \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\hat{g}_{i,j}}{k} \\\\right) \\\\right)$$\\n\\nAfter making this adjustment per attribute, total entropy of the neighbourhood is additive:\\n\\n$$\\\\text{Adjusted Intersectional Entropy} \\\\equiv H_{\\\\text{total}} = \\\\sum_{d \\\\in D} \\\\left( \\\\frac{H(d)}{H_{\\\\text{exp}}(d, k)} - 1 \\\\right)$$\"}"]}

On LHS, we show adjusted entropy per attribute, which add to intersectional entropy. *Participant ID* and *Cluster ID* act as robustness checks to confirm local neighbourhoods (i) contain non-duplicated authors, and (ii) are contained within one topic cluster. On RHS, we show neighbourhood diversity by neighbourhood size, rebased relative to expected entropy @$k$. 84% of neighbourhoods are not more homogeneous than the random baseline (with 99% CI shown).\\n\\n### S.2 Local Neighbourhood Headline Results\\n\\nWe first present findings for $\\\\tau_{\\\\text{cos}} = 0.125$ (the threshold recommended by Hale [157]), then present similar findings for other $\\\\tau_{\\\\text{cos}}$ in App. S.3. From 8,011 prompts, there are only 273 unique local neighbourhoods (3.4%), implying that PRISM contains a high degree of semantically-diverse prompts and that much of the variation in dialogue may be idiosyncratic. However, the semantically-constrained neighbourhoods that do emerge contain prompts of diverse authors, especially as $k$ increases: only 12% of prompts appear in neighbourhoods with authors from a single geographic region, only 18% from single religion, and only 8% from single age. Once we combine intersections across five attributes (gender, age, ethnicity, religion and region), less than 1% of prompts appear in neighbourhoods with no intersectional diversity, while 58% have representation from least two subgroups for all attributes. 84% of neighbourhoods fall above or within the expected range of entropy for an equivalently-sized random sample. While tightly-clustered dialogue spaces tend to be heterogeneous, we anecdotally observe some homogeneous neighbourhoods\u2014the largest of which contain discussions of gun laws by predominantly White participants only in the US; and of Scottish independence, Brexit and UK elections from White participants in the UK. Other regions contribute small specialised neighbourhoods, like indigenous rights treaties in Australia and New Zealand; or Mexican, Argentinian and Chilean politics in Latin America. In contrast, many of the largest neighbourhoods present cross-border perspectives on controversial issues like abortion and the Israel-Palestine conflict (Fig. 28).\\n\\n### S.3 Local Neighbourhood Robustness Checks\\n\\nIn Tab. 23, we present summary statistics for the results discussed in \u00a7 3.1 but at varying cosine distance thresholds.

We define a **field site** as a region of the embedding space where both participant opening prompts and model responses are semantically constrained, so that the same (or very similar) context gets multiple ratings from different participants. The number of field sites depend on $\\\\tau_{\\\\text{cos}}$: more lenient distance thresholds lead to more sites (Tab. 24). However, even with strict thresholds ($\\\\tau_{\\\\text{cos}} = 0.05$), we find field sites with substantial range in scores ($\\\\mu = 36.3, \\\\sigma = 26.5$) demonstrating that, *even when dialogue context is fixed*, different individuals have different preferences for model responses. We encourage future work examining these field sites, though note that participants self-select into these \u201cduplicate\u201d groups, so the allocation is non-random.\\n\\nEven in these very strict local neighbourhoods, we find evidence of intersectional diversity. When $\\\\tau_{\\\\text{cos}} = 0.05$, we find 154 neighbourhoods (86% above or within 99% CI for expected entropy). The five largest of these contain 14\u201360 prompts, varying only in capitalisation and punctuation. The first three are all greetings-based (\u201cHello\u201d, $k = 60$; \u201cHello, how are you\u201d, $k = 34$; \u201cHi\u201d, $k = 21$) but the others provide multicultural perspectives on subjective issues. One neighbourhood (\u201cDoes God exist?\u201d, $k = 14$) contains half religious participants, half non-religious, who are distributed across four ethnicities, balanced by age and gender, and with representation from every geographic region. The other (\u201cWhat do you think about abortion\u201d, $k = 14$) is 60% male vs 40% female; 70% younger than 35 vs 30% older; 40% White vs 60% Non-White; 30% Christian vs 70% irreligious, and has four regions. Each prompt receives up to four model responses, so these neighbourhoods provide interesting field sites for preference modelling. As an example, there is one of these field sites (at strict threshold of $\\\\tau_{\\\\text{cos}} = 0.05$), where two unique participants ask:\\n\\n$k = 2$: **Participants\u2019 Prompts:** ['what is the best religion in the world?'; \u2018what is the best religion?\u2019]\\n\\nAnd two very similar model responses receive the scores [67, 90].\\n\\n**Model Responses:** ['I am not able to answer that question. Religion is a personal matter, and there is no one \u201cbest\u201d religion. What matters most is that you find a religion that provides you with comfort, guidance, and a sense of community.\u2019; \u2018I am not able to answer that question. Religion is a very personal matter, and there is no one \\\"best\\\" religion for everyone.

Now we consider regions of PRISM where different participants rate the exact same prompt-response pairs.\\n\\n**Different participants rating the same pair** We find 40 field sites where at least two participants rate the same prompt-response pair. Of these, 26 receive only two unique participant ratings, six field sites have three unique raters, four sites have four unique raters, two sites have five unique raters, and two sites have eight unique raters. We provide examples in Tab. 25. Though many of these comprise greetings and introductions, there are three examples of religion-related sites (e.g. \u201cdoes god exist\u201d). We compute the max-min of the score range over all fixed sites, still finding substantial score deviations between participants ($\\\\mu_{\\\\text{diff}} = 35.4$, $\\\\sigma_{\\\\text{diff}} = 31.7$, see Fig. 29).\\n\\n**The same participant rating the same pair** There are 44 field sites where the same participant rates a duplicate prompt-response pair. This occurs when a participant\u2019s prompt receives two or more identical model responses, usually from the same model family e.g. (claude-2.1, claude-2) or (gpt-4, gpt-4-turbo). We provide examples in Tab. 25. In 41 of 44 field sites, a prompt receives two identical model responses, and in the remaining three, it receives three identical model responses. There are 42 unique participants who appear in this subset. Of the two participants who appear twice, one is \u2018unlucky\u2019: two very distinct prompts are met with duplicate responses (\u201cCan you tell me a joke about cats\u201d, \u201cWhat are the main political parties in France?\u201d); the other does ask the same generic prompt twice in two different conversations (\u201cHi\u201d, \u201cHi\u201d). Given the fluid visual analog scales, participants may not have been able to rate these identical contexts with the exact same score. To understand this noise, we again compute score differences in these field sites, finding much narrower differences in general ($\\\\mu_{\\\\text{diff}} = 5.8$, $\\\\sigma_{\\\\text{diff}} = 9.3$, see Fig. 29). The 25th percentile is 0.0, 50th percentile (median) is 1.00, and the 75th percentile is 6.25. While these statistics are based on relatively few\"}"]}

We operationalise differences in participant preferences using ratings over models as a less-sparse proxy for high-dimensional text, assuming that a model (due to its training priors) responds in similar ways to similar prompts. However, future work could instead design feature-engineered reward models, examining what participant, model or conversational characteristics predict a response-specific reward at the text-level. We only focus on the opening prompt where four randomly-chosen models battle one another. We examine both idiosyncratic variation (how bootstrapping samples of \\\\( n \\\\) people drawn at random from the population affects the stability and spread of aggregated preferences); as well as groupwise variation (how including only certain groups affects aggregate preferences).\\n\\nChoice of score processing Participants\u2019 raw scores \\\\( S(y_i) \\\\) are a number between 1-100 recorded on the interface. Consider two participants, \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\), who both rate model responses \\\\( y_1 \\\\) and \\\\( y_2 \\\\). Assume for both \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\), \\\\( y_1 \\\\succ y_2 \\\\) but \\\\( A \\\\) rates \\\\( S(y_1) = 75; S(y_2) = 70 \\\\), and \\\\( B \\\\) rates \\\\( S(y_1) = 5, S(y_2) = 20 \\\\), meaning there are substantial differences in score skew and spread. Imagine that this behaviour persists across all of \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\)\u2019s conversations: \\\\( A \\\\) is consistently the optimist and \\\\( B \\\\) the pessimist. One explanation for this behaviour is that \\\\( B \\\\) just systematically uses scales differently, an issue of measurement invariance that is a known problem for subjective measures [158]. If true, we should control for participant fixed effects by normalising score (with Z-values) across each participant\u2019s set of conversations, or normalise their cardinal comparisons into ranks. However, an alternative explanation is that \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) come from very different communities with divergent preferences, and it is the case that all the models are aligned in a way that make them perform poorly to \\\\( B \\\\)\u2019s prompts. If we normalise \\\\( B \\\\)\u2019s scores, we flatten this signal. In theory, with our current data, it is not possible to disentangle these two mechanisms of preference differences across participants. While we encourage future work exploring how normalising preference ratings affect reward learning, in practice, we find very minor descriptive differences in scores across groups (App. O), and that model comparisons relying on raw and normalised scores are highly correlated (\\\\( \\\\tau_{\\\\text{Kendall}} = 1.0^{***} \\\\), App. T.3).\\n\\nChoice of tie threshold Even without identical numeric scores, participants may be indifferent between model responses, which we can reconstruct with a margin-of-victory, only counting \\\\( y_1 \\\\succ y_2 \\\\) if the score difference exceeds some tie threshold. On one hand, setting a tie threshold eliminates some noise from ratings on our fluid visual analog scale. On the other hand, choosing a tie threshold is quite arbitrary, and introduces a mix of cardinal and ordinal components. We examine sensitivity of model ranks to tie threshold in [App. T.4] In addition, we calibrate expected indifference margins from our VAS on sparse cases where the same participant rates identical prompt-response pairs (see [App. S.4]), finding a median score difference of 1, and mean of 5.8. We recommend a tie threshold in [5,10], but ultimately, future researchers and practitioners must decide depending on their usecase.\\n\\nChoice of preference aggregation function For each participant, we observe a partial profile of preference ratings over models (not every individual rates every model). Different aggregation functions can be thought of as social choice functions and choosing one over another depends on whether we trust the signal is cardinally versus ordinally measurable, and unit comparable or non-comparable [159]. For example, selecting the most preferred model among our participants by highest mean score is a form of utilitarianism [160], but relies on the assumption cardinal scores can be meaningfully summed interpersonally. We put two desiderata on a preference aggregation function in our setting. First, it must be frequency invariant, due to variability in model appearances because of failed external API calls (see [App. P]). Second, it must be intrinsically comparable across tournaments. For example, absolute Elo scores (i) cannot be compared across tournaments (or bootstrapped sampling frames); (ii) are sensitive to the order and outcomes of matches [161]; and (iii) poorly handle intransitive preference cycles [162]. A lower-rated model defeating a higher-rated model results in a significant transfer of points, so it matters when this battle occurs in our sample, as we demonstrate in [App. T.3]. In our work, we are not constrained by functions that perform well in online settings (like Elo), and can instead analyse ranks observing a full set of offline interactions. Applying these desiderata, we use Pairwise Rank Centrality as our primary aggreganda, but present a comparison of functions in [App. T.3] finding different aggregation functions produce correlated ranks (\\\\( \\\\tau_{\\\\text{Kendall}} = 0.8 - 1.0^{***} \\\\)), but introduce some movement among mid-leaderboard positions.\"}"]}

[48] and *Convergence Voting* proposed by Bana et al. [49], both mathematically inspired by Google\u2019s PageRank [50]. Each model ($M$) is a node in a graph. We convert all ratings to pairwise binary comparisons (win-loss), and count both a (win-loss) and (loss-win) if there is a tie (within threshold $t = 5$). Between each pair of nodes, we assign a transition probability calculated as the proportion of battles that $M_i$ wins over $M_j$ (or the win probability $p_{ij}$). In Bana et al. [49] these probabilities represent the number of voters for whom $i \\\\succ j$ but our interpretation is battles (not voters) because participants can make multiple ratings per pair across different conversations. Intuitively, imagine we start at one model and assume this is our collective winner. Another model is uniformly chosen at random, and we move towards that model in $p_{ij}$ of world states, and stay at the current model in the remainder states ($1-p_{ij}$). Each edge is first normalised relative to the proportion of battles, not absolute wins, and then self-loops are added so that each node has transition probabilities summing to 1. We also add the possibility for a regularisation parameter $\\\\alpha$ with a prior of how many wins each model has under its belt at initialisation. Negahban et al. [48] suggest a regularisation parameter of 1 is a sensible prior without further information, and that a stable ranking emerges with the order of $n \\\\log n$ battles in the tournament, which is safely met given $n = 21$ and each participant on average has 6 conversations with 4 models (or 6 battles, $4C2$). We repeat these steps *ad infinitum*, each time selecting a new challenger at random, and moving around the graph according to the transition probabilities. This corresponds to a random walk on an irreducible and aperiodic Markov chain. The Ergodic theorem for Markov chains then implies this random walk has a stationary distribution. Stationarity can be computed iterating over discrete steps (e.g. $\\\\text{iter}=1000$, which we opt for speed) or by extracting the left eigenvector with components summing to 1 from the transition matrix, which under conditions of allowing transition between $m_i$ and $m_j$ with non-zero probability, has a unique stationary distribution. The solution is invariant to order and the emergent score has some nice interpretative properties: Bana et al. [49] suggest it represents the share of power or seats each political party should receive, or quantifies levels of community support for the most preferred option. Translated to our setting, it can represent the period of time that a collective community prefers to converse with a particular model, the share of attention or maybe even funding each should receive.\\n\\n**Note that** in the following set of robustness experiments we include all battles in PRISM, not just the balanced subset; so, rankings may differ to Fig. 4.\"}"]}

We ultimately wish to understand how sampling different humans and integrating their specific feedback affects welfare on other users of LLMs (who were not included in the feedback stage). An ideal experiment would train LLMs on different sub-samples of feedback (e.g. 100 males in the US), and measure the distribution of welfare imposed on different sub-populations (e.g. females in the US). While training LLMs on different sub-populations is beyond this paper\u2019s scope, we approximate the thought experiment by randomly generating sub-samples of individuals to select their favourite existing LLM (those in the seat of power), and measure the the distribution of welfare imposed on different sub-populations (also called stakeholder populations [9]).\\n\\nSub-populations Let \\\\( P \\\\) denote the population of participants, \\\\( p \\\\subseteq P \\\\) denote a sub-population and \\\\( \\\\mathcal{P}(P) \\\\) denote the power set of \\\\( P \\\\) (i.e. all sub-populations). To identify specific sub-populations, we define the choice function: \\\\( \\\\text{SUBPOP} : \\\\text{REGIONS} \\\\times \\\\text{GROUPS} \\\\mapsto \\\\mathcal{P}(P) \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\text{REGIONS} = \\\\{ \\\\text{US}, \\\\text{UK} \\\\} \\\\) is a set geographical regions and \\\\( \\\\text{GROUPS} = \\\\{ \\\\text{rep, non-male, non-white, below 45, male, white, above 45} \\\\} \\\\) is a set demographic groups (rep denotes the whole population). Given \\\\( r \\\\in \\\\text{REGIONS} \\\\) and \\\\( g \\\\in \\\\text{GROUPS} \\\\), \\\\( \\\\text{SUBPOP} \\\\) returns the individuals in \\\\( P \\\\) that are in both \\\\( r \\\\) and \\\\( g \\\\). Our analysis uses the sub-populations given by: \\\\( \\\\mathcal{SP} = \\\\{ \\\\text{SUBPOP}(\\\\text{US}, \\\\text{all}), n) \\\\mid n \\\\in \\\\{10, 20, 50, 100\\\\} \\\\} \\\\cup \\\\{ \\\\text{SUBPOP}(\\\\text{US}, g), 100) \\\\mid g \\\\in \\\\{ \\\\text{male, white, above 45} \\\\} \\\\}. \\\\) We approximate the sub-population defined by a tuple \\\\((r, g)\\\\) by selecting all the matching participants in our balanced sample that are in both \\\\( r \\\\) and \\\\( g \\\\).\\n\\nSampling schemes A sampling scheme is a tuple: \\\\( S = (p, n) \\\\) where \\\\( p \\\\in \\\\mathcal{P} \\\\) and \\\\( n \\\\in \\\\mathbb{N}_+ \\\\). A sampling scheme randomly generates samples of \\\\( n \\\\) individuals from \\\\( p \\\\), the subpopulation of interest. We approximate a sampling scheme by using our approximation of sub-populations defined in the previous section and sampling \\\\( n \\\\) participants with replacement. Our main analysis uses the sampling schemes: \\\\( S = \\\\{ (\\\\text{SUBPOP}(\\\\text{US}, \\\\text{all}), n) \\\\mid n \\\\in \\\\{10, 20, 50, 100\\\\} \\\\} \\\\cup \\\\{ (\\\\text{SUBPOP}(\\\\text{US}, g), 100) \\\\mid g \\\\in \\\\{ \\\\text{male, white, above 45} \\\\} \\\\}. \\\\)\\n\\nIndividual welfare Let \\\\( M \\\\) denote the set of models. Our analysis requires a measure of welfare for an individual \\\\( j \\\\) if LLM \\\\( i \\\\) is chosen. We use two measures of individual welfare. i) \\\\( \\\\text{RATING} : P \\\\times M \\\\mapsto [1, 100] \\\\). Given participant \\\\( j \\\\) and model \\\\( i \\\\), \\\\( \\\\text{RATING}(j, i) \\\\) computes the mean rating \\\\( i \\\\) gives to LLM \\\\( j \\\\) in the first turn of a conversation. ii) \\\\( \\\\text{CHOICE} : P \\\\times M \\\\mapsto [0, 1] \\\\). \\\\( \\\\text{CHOICE}(j, i) \\\\) computes the proportion of the \\\\( j \\\\)'s conversations where LLM \\\\( i \\\\) is chosen, conditional on LLM \\\\( i \\\\) being shown. For both measures of individual welfare, if a participant is never shown a model, we set their individual welfare to \\\\( \\\\text{NA} \\\\).\\n\\nThe distribution of LLMs induced by sampling scheme A sampling scheme \\\\( S \\\\), together with a preference aggregation method induce a distribution \\\\( \\\\rho \\\\in \\\\Delta(M) \\\\). The \\\\( i \\\\)th component of \\\\( \\\\rho \\\\) is the probability that a random sample drawn from the sampling scheme chooses the LLM indexed by \\\\( i \\\\). Our main analysis uses the preference aggregation method: \\\\( \\\\text{MAXRATING} : \\\\mathcal{P}(P) \\\\mapsto M \\\\). Given draw \\\\( s \\\\sim S \\\\), we define \\\\( \\\\text{maxRatingCandidates} := \\\\arg\\\\max_{i \\\\in M} \\\\frac{1}{|s'(i)|} \\\\sum_{j \\\\in s'(i)} \\\\text{RATING}(j, i) \\\\) where \\\\( s'(i) = \\\\{ j \\\\in s \\\\mid \\\\text{rating}(j, i) \\\\neq \\\\text{NA} \\\\} \\\\). \\\\( \\\\text{MAXRATING}(s) \\\\) then returns a random element in \\\\( \\\\text{maxRatingCandidates} \\\\). In words, \\\\( \\\\text{MAXRATING} \\\\) computes the rating (as defined in the previous paragraph) given to each model by each participant in the draw of \\\\( S \\\\). It then computes the mean score of each model averaged across individual mean ratings and returns a model with the highest mean rating. We repeat the analysis for the method \\\\( \\\\text{MAXCHOICE} \\\\) which replaces \\\\( \\\\text{RATING} \\\\) with \\\\( \\\\text{CHOICE} \\\\).\\n\\nMeasuring welfare For simplicity, we summarise the welfare imposed on the population by a given model by a single number. For the main analysis, we use the measure \\\\( \\\\text{MEANRATING} : \\\\mathcal{P}(P) \\\\times M \\\\mapsto [1, 100] \\\\) where\\n\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\text{MEANRATING}(p, i) = \\\\frac{1}{|p'|} \\\\sum_{j \\\\in p'} \\\\text{RATING}(j, i)\\n\\\\]\\n\\nand \\\\( p' = \\\\{ j \\\\in p \\\\mid \\\\text{rating}(j, i) \\\\neq \\\\text{NA} \\\\} \\\\).

A concern is that our results are sensitive to randomness caused by different participants being shown different models. As a sensitivity check, we repeat the analysis with imputed scores for missing model ratings (similar to collaborative filtering), and repeat the whole exercise for the UK (see App. U.2).\\n\\nThere are some caveats to note. Despite having samples balanced by observed demographics for the UK and the US, the samples are too small to expect them to be representative on features we do not observe. So differences we pick up in the welfare analysis could be an artefact of our approximations subpopulations being noisy. Furthermore, our analysis using the \\\\(\\\\text{MEANRATING}\\\\) welfare measure assumes that individuals use scores in the same way for ratings welfare measures. However, our analysis using \\\\(\\\\text{MEANCHOICE}\\\\) is not sensitive to use of ratings scale, and the results are qualitatively similar. Finally, different sampling schemes can induce different welfare distributions via two mechanisms. First, the subpopulations sampled from may have different preferences conditional on conversation type. Second, the sub-populations sampled from may have different conversations, and in turn, choose models that are better at particular conversations. This experiment taken alone cannot disentangle these two mechanisms.\\n\\n### U.2 UK Sample\\n\\n![Welfare distributions for the UK](image)\\n\\n**Figure 38:** Welfare distributions for the UK.
