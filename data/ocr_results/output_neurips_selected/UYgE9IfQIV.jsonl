This makes sustainable data center control a priority. In this paper, we introduce SustainDC, a set of Python environments for benchmarking multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms for data centers (DC). SustainDC supports custom DC configurations and tasks such as workload scheduling, cooling optimization, and auxiliary battery management, with multiple agents managing these operations while accounting for the effects of each other. We evaluate various MARL algorithms on SustainDC, showing their performance across diverse DC designs, locations, weather conditions, grid carbon intensity, and workload requirements. Our results highlight significant opportunities to improve data center operations using MARL algorithms. Given the increasing use of DC due to AI, SustainDC provides a crucial platform for developing and benchmarking advanced algorithms essential for achieving sustainable computing and addressing other heterogeneous real-world challenges.\\n\\n1 Introduction\\n\\nOne of the growing areas of energy and carbon footprint (CFP) can be traced to cloud data centers (DCs). The increased use of cloud resources for batch workloads related to AI model training, multimodal data storage and processing, or interactive workloads like streaming services, hosting websites have prompted enterprise clients to construct numerous data centers. Governments and regulatory bodies are increasingly focusing on environmental sustainability and imposing stricter regulations to reduce carbon emissions. This has prompted industry-wide initiatives to adopt more intelligent DC control approaches. This paper presents SustainDC, a sustainable DC Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) set of environments. SustainDC helps promote and prioritize sustainability, and it serves as a platform that facilitates collaboration among AI researchers, enabling them to contribute to a more environmentally responsible DC.\\n\\nThe main contributions of this paper are the following:\\n\\n\u2022 A highly customizable suite of environments focused on Data Center (DC) operations, designed to benchmark energy consumption and carbon footprint across various DC config-\\n\\n*Corresponding author. \u2020These authors contributed equally.\"}"]}

This has resulted in the development of several environments for RL applications. *CityLearn*[^1] is an open-source platform that supports single and MARL strategies for energy coordination and demand response in urban environments. *Energym*[^2], *RL-Testbed*[^3] and *Sinergym*[^4] were developed as RL wrappers that facilitate communication between Python and EnergyPlus, enabling RL evaluation on the collection of buildings modeled in EnergyPlus. *SustainGym*[^5] is one of the latest suite of general purpose RL tasks for evaluation of sustainability, simulating electric vehicle charging scheduling and battery storage bid, which lends itself to benchmarking different control strategies for optimizing energy, carbon footprint, and related metrics in electricity markets.\\n\\nMost of the above-mentioned works use *EnergyPlus*[^6] or, *Modelica*[^7],[^8] which were primarily designed for modeling thermo-fluid interactions with traditional analytic control with little focus on Deep Learning applications. The APIs provided in these works only allow sampling actions in a model free manner, lacking a straightforward approach to customization or re-parameterization of system behavior. This is because most of the works have a set of pre-compiled binaries (e.g. FMUs in Modelica) or fine-tuned spline functions (in EnergyPlus) to simulate nominal behavior. Furthermore, there is a significant bottleneck in using these precompiled environments from Energyplus or Modelica for Python based RL applications due to latency associated with cross-platform interactions, versioning issues in traditional compilers for EnergyPlus and Modelica, unavailability of open source compilers and libraries for executing certain applications.\\n\\nSustainDC allows users to simulate the electrical and thermo-fluid behavior of large DCs directly in Python. Unlike other environments that rely on precompiled binaries or external tools, SustainDC is easily end-user customizable and fast It enables the design, configuration, and control benchmarking of DCs with a focus on sustainability. This provides the ML community with a new benchmark environment specifically for Heterogeneous MARL in the context of DC operations, allowing for extensive goal-oriented customization of the MDP transition function, state space, actions space, and rewards.\\n\\n## 3 Data Center Operational Model\\n\\nFigure[^1] illustrates the typical components of a DC operation as modeled in SustainDC. *Workloads* are uploaded to the DC from a proxy client. For non-interactive batch workloads, some of these jobs can be scheduled flexibly, allowing delays to different periods during the day for optimization.\\n\\n[^2]: GitHub repository: [https://github.com/HewlettPackard/dc-rl](https://github.com/HewlettPackard/dc-rl)\\n[^3]: Documentation: [https://hewlettpackard.github.io/dc-rl](https://hewlettpackard.github.io/dc-rl)\"}"]}

A complex HVAC system with multiple components is used to cool the IT system. As shown in Figure 2, warm air rises from the servers via convection. Driven by the HVAC fan\u2019s forced draft, this warm air enters the Computer Room Air Handler (CRAH) (depicted by red arrows), where it is cooled to an optimal setpoint by a heat exchange process using a \\\"primary\\\" chilled water loop.

The warmed water from this loop returns to the Chiller, where another heat exchange process transfers heat to a \\\"secondary\\\" chilled water loop, which carries the heat to a Cooling Tower. The cooling tower fan, operating at variable speeds, rejects this heat to the external environment, with fan speed and energy consumption determined by factors such as the secondary loop\u2019s inlet temperature at the cooling tower, the desired outlet temperature setpoint, and external air temperature and humidity.

Customization parameters for all aspects of the DC environment design in SustainDC can be fully specified through `dc_config.json`, a universal configuration file.\\n\\nFigure 3a further illustrates SustainDC, showing the Workload Environment, Data Center Environment, and Battery Environment along with their customizable parameters. Figure 3b depicts the RL loop in SustainDC, illustrating how agents\u2019 actions and states optimize DC operations, considering external variables like grid CI, workload, and weather.\\n\\n### 4.1 Workload Environment\\n\\nThe Workload Environment ($Env_{LS}$) manages the execution and scheduling of delay tolerant workloads within the DC by streaming workload traces (measured in FLOPs) over a specified time period. SustainDC includes a set of open-source workload traces from Alibaba [10] and Google [11] data centers. Users can customize this component by adding new workload traces to the `data/Workload` folder or by specifying a path to existing traces in the `dc_config.json` file.\\n\\nSome workloads are flexible, meaning they can be rescheduled within an allowable time horizon. Tasks such as updates or backups do not need immediate execution and can be delayed based on urgency or Service-Level Agreements (SLA). This flexibility allows workloads to be shifted to periods of lower grid carbon intensity (CI), thereby reducing the DC\u2019s overall carbon footprint ($CFP$).\\n\\nUsers can also customize the CI data. By default, we provide a one-year CI dataset for the following states: Arizona, California, Georgia, Illinois, New York, Texas, Virginia, and Washington, locations selected due to their high data center density.

Based on these observations, the agent chooses an action $A_{ls,t}$ (as shown in Table 1) to reschedule the flexible portion of $B_t$, to minimize the net $CFP$ over $N$ steps.\\n\\n### 4.2 Data Center Environment\\n\\nThe *Data Center* environment ($Env_{DC}$) provides a comprehensive set of configurable models and specifications. For IT-level design, SustainDC enables users to define IT Room dimensions, server cabinet arrangements (including the number of *rows* and *cabinets* per row), and both *approach* and *return* temperatures. Additionally, users can specify server and fan power characteristics, such as *idle power*, *rated full load power*, and *rated full load frequency*. All these parameters can be configured in the *dc_config.json* file.\\n\\nOn the cooling side, SustainDC allows customization of the *chiller reference power*, *cooling fan reference power*, and the supply air *setpoint* temperature for IT Room cooling. It also includes specifications for the pump and cooling tower, such as *rated full load power* and *rated full load frequency*. One of SustainDC\u2019s key features is its ability to automatically adjust HVAC cooling capacities based on workload demands and IT room configurations, a process known as \\\"sizing.\\\" This ensures that the data center remains adequately cooled without unnecessary energy expenditure. In contrast, previous environments often neglected this capability, resulting in inaccurate outcomes. For example, changing IT room configurations in other environments typically impacted only IT energy consumption without considering the overall cooling requirements, leading to inconsistent RL-based control results, as seen in *RL-Testbed* in (3). SustainDC addresses this by integrating custom supply and approach temperatures derived from Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations, simplifying the complex calculations of temperature changes between the IT Room HVAC and the IT Cabinets (9).\\n\\nIn addition, SustainDC includes weather data (in *data/Weather*) in the .epw format for the same locations as the CI data. This data, sourced from [https://energyplus.net/weather](https://energyplus.net/weather), represents typical weather conditions for these regions. Users can also specify their own weather files if needed.\\n\\nGiven $\\\\hat{B}_t$ as the adjusted workload from the *Workload Environment*, the goal of the RL agent ($Agent_{DC}$) is to select an optimal cooling setpoint $A_{dc,t}$ (Table 1) to minimize the net carbon footprint $CFP$ from combined cooling ($E_{hvac}$) and IT ($E_{it}$) energy consumption over an $N$-step horizon. In SustainDC, the agent\u2019s default state space includes the time of day and year ($SC_t$), ambient weather ($t_{db}$), IT Room temperature ($t_{room}$), previous step cooling ($E_{hvac}$) and IT ($E_{it}$) energy usage, and forecasted grid CI data ($CI_{t...t+L}$).\\n\\n### 4.3 Battery Environment\\n\\nThe *Battery Environment* ($Env_{BAT}$) is based on battery charging and discharging models, such as $f_{charging}(BatSoc, \\\\delta \\\\tau)$ from (12). Parameters for these components, including battery capacity, can be configured in the *dc_config.json* file.\\n\\nThe objective of the RL agent ($Agent_{BAT}$) is to optimally manage the battery\u2019s state of charge ($BatSoc_t$). Using inputs such as the net energy consumption ($E_{hvac} + E_{it}$) from the *Data Center* environment, the time of day ($SC_t$), the current battery state of charge ($BatSoc_t$), and forecasted grid CI data ($CI_{t...t+L}$), the agent determines an action $A_{bat,t}$ (as outlined in Table 1). Actions include charging the battery from the grid, taking no action, or discharging to provide auxiliary energy to the data center, all aimed at minimizing the overall carbon footprint, energy consumption, etc.\\n\\n### 4.4 Heterogeneous Multi Agent Control Problem\\n\\nWhile SustainDC enables users to tackle the individual control problems for each of the three environments, the primary goal of this paper is to establish a multi-agent control benchmark that facilitates joint optimization of the $CFP$ by considering the coordinated actions of all three agents ($Agent_{LS}$, $Agent_{DC}$, and $Agent_{BAT}$). The sequence of operations for the joint multi-agent and multi-environment functions can be represented as follows:\"}"]}

Users can opt for custom reward formulations by subclassing the base reward class in `utils/reward_creator.py`.\\n\\nBased on these individual rewards, we can formulate an independent or collaborative reward structure, where each agent receives partial feedback in the form of rewards from the other agent-environment pairs. The collaborative feedback reward formulation for each agent is formulated as:\\n\\n\\\\[\\nR_{LS} = \\\\alpha \\\\times r_{LS} + (1 - \\\\alpha)/2 \\\\times r_{DC} + (1 - \\\\alpha)/2 \\\\times r_{BAT}\\n\\\\]\\n\\n\\\\[\\nR_{DC} = (1 - \\\\alpha)/2 \\\\times r_{LS} + \\\\alpha \\\\times r_{DC} + (1 - \\\\alpha)/2 \\\\times r_{BAT}\\n\\\\]\\n\\n\\\\[\\nR_{BAT} = (1 - \\\\alpha)/2 \\\\times r_{LS} + (1 - \\\\alpha)/2 \\\\times r_{DC} + \\\\alpha \\\\times r_{BAT}\\n\\\\]\\n\\nHere, $\\\\alpha$ is the weighting parameter. This reward-sharing mechanism enables agents to incorporate feedback from their actions across environments, making it suitable for independent critic multi-agent RL algorithms, such as IPPO (13). For instance, the adjusted CPU load $\\\\hat{B}_t$ influences data center energy demand ($E_{\\\\text{cool}} + E_{\\\\text{it}}$), which subsequently affects the battery optimizer\u2019s charge-discharge decisions and ultimately impacts the net $CO_2$ footprint. Consequently, we explore a collaborative reward structure and conduct ablation experiments with varying $\\\\alpha$ values to assess the effectiveness of reward sharing.\\n\\n### 4.6 Extendable plug-n-play Data Center Simulation Platform\\n\\nFigure 4 illustrates the extendable and plug-and-play design of SustainDC framework for data center control to address the multi-agent optimization of data centers for resolving multiple internal and external dependencies of agents in real-time. The three different controllers for **Cooling Optimizer**, **Flexible Load Shifter** and **Battery Controller** can be substituted with **RL** or **non-RL controllers**. Similarly, the underlying models performing the simulation can be substituted easily using the **Modules and Extendable Functions** block. In the future, we plan to include the models for next generation of fanless direct liquid cooling for AI servers (14) for Energy HVAC Model Plug-in.\\n\\n### 5 Evaluation Metrics and Experimental Settings\\n\\nWe consider five metrics to evaluate various RL approaches on SustainDC. The $CO_2$ footprint ($CFP$) represents the cumulative carbon emissions associated with DC operations over the evaluation period. **HVAC Energy** refers to the energy consumed by cooling components, including the chiller, pumps, and cooling tower. **IT Energy** refers to the energy consumed by the servers within the DC. **Water Usage**, the volume of chilled water recirculated through the cooling system, is a critical metric in DCs where chilled water supply from a central plant is constrained, and efficient use of this resource helps minimize the DC\u2019s water footprint. Finally, **Task Queue** tracks the accumulation of compute FLOPs from workloads that are deferred for rescheduling under lower CI periods. Higher Task Queue values indicate poorer SLA performance within the DC.\\n\\nExperiments were conducted on an Intel\u00ae Xeon\u00ae Platinum 8470 server with 104 CPUs, utilizing 4 threads per training agent.

To investigate this, we can perform ablation studies in which we evaluate net operating CFP by running trained RL agents in only one or two of the SustainDC environments while employing baseline methods ($B_*$) in the other environments. For the Workload Environment ($Env_{LS}$), the baseline ($B_{LS}$) assumes no workload shifting over the horizon, which aligns with current standard practices in most data centers. For the Data Center Environment ($Env_{DC}$), we use the industry-standard ASHRAE Guideline 36 as the baseline ($B_{DC}$) (15). In the Battery Environment ($Env_{BAT}$), we adapt the method from (12) for real-time operation, reducing the original optimization horizon from 24 hours to 3 hours as our baseline ($B_{BAT}$). Future work will include further baseline comparisons using Model Predictive Control (MPC) and other non-ML control algorithms.\\n\\nNext, we perform ablations on the collaborative reward parameter $\\\\alpha$, followed by benchmarking various multi-agent RL approaches. This includes multi-agent PPO (16) with an independent critic for each actor (IPPO) (13) and a centralized critic with access to states and actions from other MDPs (MAPPO) (17). Given the heterogeneous nature of action and observation spaces in SustainDC, we also benchmark several heterogeneous multi-agent RL (HARL) methods (18), including HAPPO (Heterogeneous Agent PPO), HAA2C (Heterogeneous Agent Advantage Actor Critic), HAD3QN (Heterogeneous Agent Dueling Double Deep Q Network), and HASAC (Heterogeneous Agent Soft Actor Critic). MARL agents were trained on one location and evaluated across different locations.\\n\\nIn Figure 5, we compare the relative performance of different RL algorithms using a radar chart based on the evaluation metrics in Section 5. Since reporting absolute values may lack context, we instead plot relative performance differences, offering insights into the pros and cons of each approach. (Absolute values for these benchmark experiments are provided in the supplementary document in tabular format.) Metrics are normalized by their mean and standard deviation, with lower values positioned at the radar chart periphery and higher values toward the center. Hence, the larger the area for an approach on the radar chart, the better its performance across the evaluated metrics.\\n\\n6.1 Single vs multi-agent Benchmarks\\n\\nFigure 5a compares the relative performance of a single RL agent versus multi-agent RL benchmarks, highlighting the advantages of a MARL approach for sustainable DC operations. Among single RL agent approaches, the workload manager RL agent (Experiment 1) and the battery agent (Experiment 3) perform similarly in reducing water usage. The standalone DC (cooling) RL agent (Experiment 2) demonstrates strong performance in both energy and CFP reduction. Note that for Experiments 1 and 3, the Lowest Task Queue metric should be disregarded, as the baseline workload manager does not shift workloads and thus inherently has the lowest task queue.\\n\\nWhen we evaluate pairs of RL agents working simultaneously, the absence of a cooling optimization agent (e.g., Experiment 5) results in performance similar to single RL agent implementations (Experiments 1 and 3), where only $A_{LS}$ or $A_{BAT}$ are used with baseline agents. This indicates that the RL-based cooling optimizer significantly improves overall performance compared to the rule-based ASHRAE Guideline 36 controller (as seen in Experiments 2 and 4). Finally, when all three RL agents operate simultaneously without a shared critic (Experiment 7 using IPPO), they achieve better outcomes in energy consumption, water usage, and task queue management, with a CFP relatively similar to other experiments. The combined performance across all three agents highlights the benefits of a MARL approach for DC optimization.\\n\\n6.2 Reward Ablation on $\\\\alpha$\\n\\nFigure 5b shows the relative differences in performance when considering collaborative reward components. We considered 2 values of $\\\\alpha$ at the extremes to indicate no collaboration ($\\\\alpha = 1.0$) and relying only on the rewards of other agents ($\\\\alpha = 0.1$). An intermediate value of $\\\\alpha = 0.8$ was chosen based on similar work on reward-based collaborative approach in (19, 20). The improvement in setting $\\\\alpha = 0.8$ shows that considering rewards from other agents can improve performance w.r.t. no collaboration ($\\\\alpha = 1.0$) especially in a partially observable MDP.\"}"]}

Figures 5c, 5d, 5e, and 5f illustrate the relative performance of these methods for DCs located in New York, Georgia, California, and Arizona. Our results reveal a consistent trend where PPO-based shared actor-critic methods (MAPPO, HAPPO) outperform the independent agent counterpart, IPPO. On further analysis, we observed that while IPPO effectively reduces HVAC and IT energy, the battery agent struggles to optimally schedule charging and discharging from the grid to meet data center demand. Among MAPPO, HAPPO, and HAA2C, HAPPO consistently performs best (except in Georgia).\\n\\nFor the off-policy methods (HAD3QN and HASAC), performance varies significantly across regions, with HASAC achieving the highest performance in Arizona. The reasons for these regional performance variations are not fully understood and may be partially due to differences in weather and carbon intensity. We plan to further investigate these variations in future work.\\n\\n7 Limitations\\n\\nThe absence of an oracle that already knows the best results possible for the different environments makes it difficult to quantify the threshold for performance compared to simpler environments. For computational speed in RL, we used reduced order models for certain components like pumps and cooling towers. We could not exhaustably tune the hyperparameters for all the networks.\\n\\n8 Next Steps\\n\\nWe are planning to deploy the trained agents to real data centers and are working towards domain adaptation for deployment with safeguards. We will augment the codebase with these updates. In order to have a smooth integration with current systems where HVAC runs in isolation, we plan a phased deployment with recommendation to the data center operative followed by direct integration of the control agents with the HVAC system with safeguards. For real-world deployment, a trained model should be run on a production server using appropriate checkpoints within a containerized platform with necessary dependencies. Security measures must restrict the software to only read essential data, generate decision variables, and write them with limited access to secure memory for periodic reading by the data center\u2019s HVAC management system. To ensure robustness against communication loss, a backup mechanism for generating decision variables is essential.\\n\\n9 Conclusion\\n\\nThis paper introduced SustainDC, a fully Python-based benchmarking environment for multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) in sustainable, cost-effective, and energy-efficient data center operations. SustainDC provides comprehensive customization options for modeling multiple aspects of data centers, including a flexible RL reward design, an area we invite other researchers to explore further. We benchmarked an extensive collection of single-agent and multi-agent RL algorithms in SustainDC across multiple geographical locations, comparing their performance to guide researchers in sustainable data center management with reinforcement learning.\\n\\nAdditionally, we are collaborating with consortiums like ExaDigiT, which focuses on high-performance computing (HPC) and supercomputing, as well as with industry partners, to implement some of these approaches in real-world scenarios. SustainDC\u2019s complexity and constraints, rooted in realistic systems, make it a suitable platform for benchmarking hierarchical RL algorithms. We plan to implement continual reinforcement learning to accommodate dynamic data center environments and prevent out-of-distribution errors during equipment upgrades and accessory changes.\\n\\nMoreover, SustainDC features an extendable, plug-and-play architecture of data center modeling compatible with digital twin frameworks, supporting research into other aspects of data center optimization for joint and multi-objective goals.\"}"]}

The environment is designed to evaluate the performance of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms in rescheduling delay-capable workloads within the DC.\\n\\nLet $B_t$ be the instantaneous DC workload trace at time $t$, with $X\\\\%$ of the load being rescheduled up to $N$ simulation steps into the future. The goal of an RL agent ($Agent_{LS}$) is to observe the current time of day ($SC_t$), the current and forecast grid CI data ($CI_{t...t+L}$), and the amount of rescheduled workload left ($D_t$). Based on these observations, the agent decides an action $A_{ls,t}$ to reschedule the flexible component of $B_t$ to create a modified workload $\\\\hat{B}_t$, thus minimizing the net $CFP = \\\\sum_{t=0}^{N} CFP_t$ over $N$ steps.

This rate ensures that the battery does not exceed its maximum capacity \\\\( C_{\\\\text{max}} \\\\) and that charging occurs efficiently.\\n\\nDischarging Rate (\\\\( r_{\\\\text{discharge}} \\\\))  The discharging rate \\\\( r_{\\\\text{discharge}} \\\\) is the rate at which energy is drawn from the battery during the discharging process. It is defined as:\\n\\n\\\\[\\nr_{\\\\text{discharge}} = \\\\min \\\\left( \\\\frac{E_{bat,t}}{\\\\eta_{\\\\text{discharge}} \\\\cdot \\\\Delta t}, P_{\\\\text{discharge,max}} \\\\right)\\n\\\\]\\n\\nwhere \\\\( P_{\\\\text{discharge,max}} \\\\) is the maximum allowable discharging power. This rate ensures that the battery does not discharge below zero and that discharging occurs efficiently.\\n\\nEnergy Constraints  The state of charge is bounded by the battery capacity:\\n\\n\\\\[\\n0 \\\\leq E_{bat,t} \\\\leq C_{\\\\text{max}}\\n\\\\]\\n\\nBattery Power Constraints  The maximum power that the battery can charge or discharge is limited by:\\n\\n\\\\[\\nP_{\\\\text{charge,max}} = u \\\\cdot P_{\\\\text{charge}} + v\\n\\\\]\\n\\n\\\\[\\nP_{\\\\text{discharge,max}} = u \\\\cdot P_{\\\\text{discharge}} + v\\n\\\\]\\n\\nSimple Reward Calculation  The goal of the three agents (\\\\( \\\\text{Agent}_{\\\\text{LS}}, \\\\text{Agent}_{\\\\text{DC}}, \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\text{Agent}_{\\\\text{BAT}} \\\\)) is to minimize the cumulative carbon footprint (CFP) over a given horizon \\\\( N \\\\). The CFP at each time step \\\\( t \\\\) is computed as:\\n\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\text{CFP}_t = (E_{\\\\text{it},t} + E_{\\\\text{hvac},t} + E_{\\\\text{bat},t}) \\\\cdot CI_t\\n\\\\]\\n\\nwhere:\\n\\n- \\\\( E_{\\\\text{it},t} \\\\): Energy consumption by IT equipment due to \\\\( \\\\hat{B}_t \\\\)\\n- \\\\( E_{\\\\text{hvac},t} \\\\): Energy consumption by HVAC systems\\n- \\\\( E_{\\\\text{bat},t} \\\\): Energy contribution from the battery (positive when discharging, negative when charging)\\n- \\\\( CI_t \\\\): Grid carbon intensity at time \\\\( t \\\\)\\n\\nThe total reward is then:\\n\\n\\\\[\\nR = -\\\\sum_{t=0}^{N} \\\\text{CFP}_t\\n\\\\]\\n\\nThe reward could have other terms that may consider queue length, water usage, average task delay, etc.\"}"]}

This diagram highlights how the decisions made by each agent impact the overall DC operations and contribute to the optimization of energy consumption and carbon footprint.\\n\\nIn the Workload Environment ($Env_{LS}$), the RL agent ($Agent_{LS}$) reschedules flexible workloads to optimize utilization. This action will influence the IT load, which directly impacts the Data Center Environment ($Env_{DC}$). The RL agent ($Agent_{DC}$) in the data center environment adjusts the CRAC setpoints to optimize cooling and IT operations, thus affecting the HVAC cooling load and overall energy consumption.\\n\\nThe Battery Environment ($Env_{BAT}$) is influenced by the energy demands of the data center environment. The RL agent ($Agent_{BAT}$) manages the charging and discharging of the battery to optimize energy usage and reduce the carbon footprint. The interconnections between these environments ensure that the agents work together to minimize the cumulative CFP by considering the energy consumption of IT, HVAC, and battery systems.\\n\\nBy observing the current state and forecast data, each agent makes informed decisions that contribute to the overall sustainability and efficiency of the data center operations. This coordinated approach leverages the strengths of each environment to achieve significant reductions in energy consumption and carbon emissions.\\n\\nB Customization of dc_config.json\\n\\nThe customization of the DC is done through the dc_config.json file located in the utils folder. This file allows users to specify every aspect of the DC environment design. We show here a part of the configuration file to indicate the different configurable elements inside SustainDC. Additional elements can be added to this config either under an existing section or a new section, and utils/dc_config_reader.py will automatically import the new configurations. Inside the \\\"data_center_configuration\\\" SustainDC allows the user to configure the dimensions of the data\"}"]}

The states with the most significant number of data centers tend to be Virginia, Texas, California, and New York. Virginia, especially, is a major hub due to its proximity to Washington D.C. and the abundance of fiber optic cable networks. Texas and California are also prominent due to their size, economic output, and significant tech industries. New York, particularly around New York City, hosts numerous data centers that serve the financial sector and other industries.\\n\\nThe selection of these locations is justified by their significant number of data centers, which emphasizes the potential impact of DRL agents in these regions. By targeting areas with both high data center density and favorable carbon intensity characteristics, DRL agents can maximize their effectiveness in reducing carbon emissions.\\n\\nF Reward Evaluation and Customization\\n\\nF.1 Load Shifting Penalty ($L_{S\\\\text{Penalty}}$)\\n\\nThe Load Shifting Penalty ($L_{S\\\\text{Penalty}}$) is applied to the Load Shifting Agent ($Agent_{LS}$) in the Workload Environment ($Env_{LS}$) if it fails to reschedule flexible workloads within the same day. If $D_t$ (the amount of rescheduled workload left) is positive at the end of the day, $\\\\text{penalty\\\\_tasks\\\\_queue}$ is assigned. Additionally, we included a function that progressively increases the penalty as the hour of the day approaches 24h. This means the penalty increases linearly from hour 23h to hour 24h.\\n\\nFurthermore, there is a penalty for tasks that were dropped due to queue limits ($\\\\text{penalty\\\\_dropped\\\\_tasks}$). This penalty is added to discourage the agent from dropping tasks and ensure that workloads are managed efficiently.\\n\\nTherefore, the $L_{S\\\\text{Penalty}}$ is composed of $\\\\text{penalty\\\\_tasks\\\\_queue}$ and $\\\\text{penalty\\\\_dropped\\\\_tasks}$.

To create a custom reward function, you can define it as follows:\\n\\n```python\\ndef custom_reward(params: dict) -> float:\\n    # Custom reward calculation logic\\n    pass\\n```\\n\\nReplace the logic inside the `custom_reward` function with your custom reward logic.\\n\\nFor more examples of custom reward functions, users can check the file `utils/reward_creator.py`.\\n\\nTo use the custom reward function, you need to include it in the `utils/reward_creator.py` as follows:\\n\\n```python\\n# Other reward methods can be added here.\\nREWARD_METHOD_MAP = {\\n    'default_dc_reward' : default_dc_reward,\\n    'default_bat_reward': default_bat_reward,\\n    'default_ls_reward' : default_ls_reward,\\n    # Add custom reward methods here\\n    'custom_reward' : custom_reward,\\n}\\n```\\n\\nAdditionally, you need to specify the reward function in `harl/configs/envs_cfgs/dcrl.yaml`:\\n\\n```yaml\\nagents:\\n    ...\\n    ls_reward: default_ls_reward\\n    dc_reward: default_dc_reward\\n    bat_reward: default_bat_reward\\n    ...\\n```\"}"]}
