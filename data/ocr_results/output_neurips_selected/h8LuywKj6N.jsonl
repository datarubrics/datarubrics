However, current agents primarily exhibit excellent understanding capabilities in static environments and are predominantly applied in relatively simple domains, such as Web or mobile interfaces. We argue that a robust GUI agent should be capable of perceiving temporal information on the GUI, including dynamic Web content and multi-step tasks. Additionally, it should possess a comprehensive understanding of various GUI scenarios, including desktop software and multi-window interactions. To this end, this paper introduces a new dataset, termed GUI-WORLD, which features meticulously crafted Human-MLLM annotations, extensively covering six GUI scenarios and eight types of GUI-orientated questions in three formats. We evaluate the capabilities of current state-of-the-art MLLMs, including ImageLLMs and VideoLLMs, in understanding various types of GUI content, especially dynamic and sequential content. Our findings reveal that ImageLLMs struggle with dynamic GUI content without manually annotated keyframes or operation history. On the other hand, VideoLLMs fall short in all GUI-orientated tasks given the sparse GUI video dataset. Based on GUI-WORLD, we take the initial step of leveraging a fine-tuned VideoLLM as a GUI agent, demonstrating an improved understanding of various GUI tasks. However, due to the limitations in the performance of base LLMs, we conclude that using VideoLLMs as GUI agents remains a significant challenge. We believe our work provides valuable insights for future research in dynamic GUI content understanding.\\n\\n1 Introduction\\n\\nMultimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), such as GPT-4V(ision) [1] and LLaVA [2], have significantly contributed to the development of the visual-text domain [3]. These models bring forth innovative solutions and paradigms for traditional visual tasks, including visual reasoning [4], medical image interpretation [5, 6], and applications in embodied agents [7]. One particularly promising area is Graphical User Interface (GUI) understanding, which holds significant potential for real-world applications, such as webpage comprehension [8, 9] and navigation by GUI agents [10\u201312]. The key challenges of GUI understanding are twofold: effective GUI agents are expected to (1) possess a deep understanding of GUI elements, including webpage icons, text identified through Optical Character Recognition (OCR), and page layouts, and (2) exhibit an exceptional ability to follow instructions within GUI contexts, such as conducting searches through search engines.\"}"]}

(2) The videos may lack comprehensiveness, typically capturing only commonly used operations and overlooking rarer functions crucial for dataset completeness. To address these issues, we also source videos from social media platforms that host a diverse array of GUI-related content. Specifically, we download tutorial videos from YouTube\u2014given its prevalence as a video-sharing platform\u2014because they richly detail various GUI operations. These videos are then segmented into shorter clips, each representing a distinct sequence of operations.\\n\\nThe subsequent step involves annotating these video clips with keyframes and textual descriptions of each keyframe using custom-designed annotation software. Although several algorithms exist for keyframe extraction [26\u201329], they typically underperform with GUI videos where changes between frames might be minimal (*e.g.*, a slight movement in the mouse cursor). To ensure high-quality datasets, we therefore perform manual extraction of these keyframes. Each keyframe is meticulously annotated to include details such as the operation performed, the purpose between two keyframes, the software or website used, mouse actions (*e.g.*, scroll, click), and keyboard inputs (*e.g.*, copy (Ctrl + C), paste (Ctrl + V), specific input). We detail our annotation process in subsection B.3.\\n\\n2.3 GUI Tasks Generation from Human-MLLM Collaboration\\n\\nDrawing insights from prior research [30\u201334], we develop a Human-MLLM collaboration pipeline to annotate captions and diverse types of QA specifically tailored for GUI comprehension. The process involves inputting an instructional prompt, a comprehensive description, key information (*e.g.*, system or application), and a sequence of human-annotated keyframes into GPT-4V. As depicted in Table 3, GUI-WORLD features an array of question types, as detailed in follows:\\n\\n- **Detailed and Summarized Captioning:** This task challenges basic GUI knowledge and multimodal perception, also addressing the deficiency of detailed GUI content in video-caption pairs. Initially, GPT-4V generates two distinct descriptions for each video: one concentrating on fine-grained details and the other on the overall image sequences. Furthermore, GPT-4V provides a succinct summary, highlighting core operations and overarching objectives in the video.\\n\\n1 https://www.notion.so/\"}"]}

We instruct GPT-4V to generate free-form queries with a golden answer concerning static GUI elements or specific scenes that recur in more than two keyframes, ensuring their consistent presence in the video. Additionally, GPT-4V also crafts QA pairs that evaluate inferential skills in static content, focusing on interrelations among icons or textual information.\\n\\n\u25b7 **Dynamic and Sequential GUI Content:** This task concentrates on temporal content in GUI video, such as dynamically changing interfaces, and aims to elucidate the sequential information and reasoning chains within GUI content. We direct GPT-4V to identify consistently changing elements to create queries for dynamic content. Moreover, predictive tasks are formulated on order and temporal relation in provided sequential images, challenging agents to anticipate future events or states.\\n\\nIn the last stage, human annotators will follow the guideline in subsection B.3 and carefully review the entire video and MLLM-generated QA pairs to correct inaccuracies and hallucinations, as well as supplement information for both questions and answers to make these tasks more challenging.\\n\\n### 3 Progressive Enhancement on GUI Perception Ability\\n\\nWe introduce our strategy to enhance the GUI-oriented capabilities of current MLLMs on both static and dynamic GUI content. Inspired by previous studies [9, 35], we structure our methodology into two distinct fine-tuning stages, as illustrated in Figure 4. Initially, we fine-tune the MLLM on simpler tasks, such as description queries and captioning exercises, to instill a basic understanding of GUI elements. Subsequently, building on this foundation, the second stage aims to augment the MLLM\u2019s proficiency with more complex and challenging tasks. Our fine-tuning is all based on the Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT): \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}_{\\\\text{SFT}} (\\\\pi_\\\\theta) = -\\\\mathbb{E}_{(x,y) \\\\sim \\\\mathcal{D}} [\\\\log \\\\pi_\\\\theta(y | x)] \\\\), where \\\\( x \\\\) is the input, \\\\( y \\\\) is LLMs\u2019 output, and \\\\( \\\\pi_\\\\theta \\\\) denotes the model parameters that need to be optimized.\\n\\n**Stage-1: Learning Preliminary for GUI Content.** The initial phase focuses on aligning GUI content with a pre-trained vision encoder and a base LLM, utilizing GUI videos accompanied by detailed descriptions and captions. This phase aims to embed a robust understanding of fundamental GUI concepts and terminology within the MLLM. By engaging the model in basically captioning various GUI components, the model learns to recognize and articulate the functionalities and visual characteristics of these elements, thereby laying a solid groundwork for GUI knowledge.\\n\\n**Stage-2: Mastering Advanced GUI Capability.** Building on the foundational knowledge established in Stage 1, the second stage focuses on advancing the MLLM\u2019s proficiency in interacting with GUI elements through more complex tasks. These tasks are designed to simulate real-world scenarios that the MLLM might encounter in GUI environments, which include predicting based on\"}"]}

Initially, videos and images are encoded using the UMT-L visual encoder [36]. Subsequently, a QFormer compresses visual tokens into a smaller set of query tokens. Drawing inspiration from [37], we enhance the QFormer [38] by integrating instructions to enable it to extract visual representations pertinent to the given instructions. Additionally, we apply low-rank adaptation (LoRA [39]) to base LLM. This model is concurrently fine-tuned with the visual encoder and QFormer using a Vision-grounded Text Generation (VTG) loss: $\\\\mathcal{L}_{VTG}(\\\\theta) = -\\\\mathbb{E} \\\\left[ \\\\log p(y|v; \\\\theta) \\\\right]$, where $v$ represents the visual tokens derived from the QFormer, and $y$ represents the text output grounded in the visual context.\\n\\n4 Experiments and Analysis\\n\\n4.1 Experimental Setups\\n\\nModels. We conduct evaluations on four of the most robust image-based MLLMs: GPT-4V(ision) [1], GPT-4o [40], Qwen-VL-Max [41], and Gemini-Pro-1.5 [42]. We benchmark on three keyframe selection settings: (1) Random, where frames are sampled at fixed time intervals within a video; (2) Extracted, with keyframes extracted using Katna\\\\(^2\\\\); and (3) Human, where keyframes are selected by humans during the annotation process. For the Random and Extracted settings, we input 10 frames into each MLLM, while the Human setting uses an average of 6.719 frames, as detailed in Table 2. Each model\u2019s responses employ a three-step Chain-of-Thought (CoT) [43] process, i.e., \u201cDescribe-Analyze-Answer\u201d, to evaluate their peak performance. Additionally, we assessed three advanced VideoLLMs\u2014ChatUnivi [44], Minigpt4-video [45], and Videochat2 [46]\u2014for their performance on GUI content. For detailed experimental setups are referred to Appendix D.\\n\\nEvaluation Metrics.

For a comprehensive evaluation, we also provide BLEU [50] and BERTScore [51] in Appendix E. For multiple-choice questions, we measure performance using accuracy as the primary evaluation metric.\\n\\nTextual Information Integration. To investigate the effectiveness of integrating image-caption models to enlarge the context window for LLMs\u2014typically employed in natural videos\u2014and the helpfulness of GUI history content in accomplishing GUI-oriented tasks, we implement three experimental settings: Detailed Caption, Concise Caption, and Vision + Detailed Caption.

This performance gap highlights a significant shortfall in understanding environments where GUI elements are scattered and demand sophisticated interpretation. It emphasizes the critical need for specialized benchmarks and datasets tailored to these complex GUI scenarios, which is essential for enhancing the GUI-oriented capabilities of MLLMs, paving the way for them to become truly reliable and high-performing general control agents.\\n\\n**Keyframe Selection is Important for GUI-orientated Tasks.** Across both basic tasks such as captioning and more complex tasks like prediction and reasoning, significant variations are evident among keyframe selection methods. GPT-4V and Gemini significantly benefit from using random-selected and human-selected keyframes, scoring approximately 0.2-0.3 points higher in both captioning and free-form tasks than those using programmatic extraction. This suggests that traditional keyframe technologies, designed for natural videos, are less effective for detecting essential GUI operations, particularly when subtle movements like mouse clicks and dynamic changes are involved. Conversely, the difference in performance is relatively smaller in Qwen-VL-Max, indicating that while keyframe selection methods are crucial for models proficient in GUI content, they exert less influence on less capable models.\\n\\n**Dynamic GUI Tasks Continue to Challenge MLLMs.** In the fine-grained tasks depicted in Table 5, GPT-4V and GPT-4o excel with static GUI content and prediction tasks over image sequences but struggle with providing detailed descriptions for entire videos and dynamic GUI content. This discrepancy is attributed to minor variations in GUI that significantly impact descriptions. Enhancing the number of keyframes and the granularity of perception might mitigate these issues. Among VideoLLMs, ChatUnivi excels in conversational tasks by effectively leveraging contextual nuances, particularly in subsequent rounds, yet it underperforms in GUI-oriented captioning tasks. In contrast, GUI-Vid demonstrates proficiency in sequential tasks but falls short in both captioning and static content handling. This gap is linked to deficiencies in GUI-Vid\u2019s pretraining, which lacked comprehensive GUI content crucial for effective vision-text alignment, as evidenced by its poor performance in Table 13 and an instruction tuning process also failed to fully address these shortcomings.\\n\\n**Vision Perception is Important for Sequential GUI Tasks.** As demonstrated in Table 5, integrating detailed textual information slightly outperforms purely vision-based inputs or detailed captions, akin to a Chain of Thought (CoT) [43] setting. Surprisingly, GPT-4V excels in caption and prediction\"}"]}

As a pioneering study in training VideoLLMs as screen agents, GUI-Vid significantly outperforms the baseline model, showing an average improvement of 30% across various tasks and GUI scenarios, even surpassing the commercial ImageLLM, Qwen-VL-Max. This enhancement is particularly notable in captioning and prediction over image sequences, where GUI-Vid matches the performance of GPT-4V and Gemini-Pro. As shown in Figure 6, our two-stage progressive fintuning significantly enhances the performance in all GUI scenarios. Remarkably, GUI-Vid scored 3.747 in caption tasks within the XR scenario, highlighting its potential in XR applications and the high-quality annotations provided by our dataset. However, in Multiple-Choice QA and Chatbot tasks, GUI-Vid still lags behind industry leaders like GPT-4V and Gemini-Pro, a discrepancy likely due to the baseline LLM\u2019s weaker performance and the challenges of instruction-based fine-tuning.\\n\\nUpper Bound of GUI-orientated Capability with More Keyframes and High Resolution. As depicted in Table 6, our two ablation studies during the fine-tuning phase demonstrate that utilizing GUI image-text captioning data significantly enhances the model\u2019s preliminary understanding of GUI elements, outperforming training that relies solely on videos. Additionally, an increased number of keyframes correlates with improved performance across various scenarios, notably in environments featuring multiple windows and software applications. Further evidence from Table 7 reveals that higher image resolutions substantially boost task performance, both basic and complex, for GPT-4o. These findings underscore the potential for further developing a more robust GUI Agent.\\n\\n5 Conclusion\\n\\nIn this paper, we have introduced GUI-WORLD, a comprehensive GUI-oriented dataset designed to benchmark and enhance understanding of virtual interface, especially sequential and dynamic tasks. This dataset extensively covers six scenarios and various tasks, addressing the previous research gap in comprehensively evaluating models\u2019 capabilities in graphic-based understanding. We conduct extensive benchmarks on leading MLLMs and the first Video Agent \u2018GUI-Vid\u2019 finetuned on our GUI-WORLD specifically for tasks requiring temporal information, achieving results comparable to top-performing models, providing detailed insights into enhancing GUI-related capabilities.\"}"]}

Firstly, despite expanding the dataset to include various GUI scenarios, our models still show limited generalization capabilities when applied to environments not represented in the training data. This highlights the need for further research to improve the adaptability and robustness of GUI agents in diverse and unseen environments. Additionally, the accuracy of our models heavily relies on the selection of keyframes. Automatically extracted keyframes often fail to capture the essential elements needed for accurate GUI understanding, indicating the need for more sophisticated keyframe extraction techniques. Furthermore, although VideoLLMs have shown improvements in handling dynamic content, their ability to understand and predict sequential information in GUI tasks remains suboptimal. This suggests a necessity for future work to focus on enhancing the temporal understanding capabilities of these models. Finally, the training and fine-tuning processes for VideoLLMs require significant computational resources, which may not be accessible to all researchers.\\n\\n7 Potential Negative Societal Impacts\\n\\nWhile our work aims to advance the capabilities of GUI agents for beneficial applications, it is important to consider potential negative societal impacts. The use of GUI agents, especially those capable of operating across multiple environments and platforms, raises significant privacy concerns. Ensuring that these agents operate within strict ethical guidelines and that user data is handled securely and responsibly is paramount. There is also the risk of misuse of advanced GUI agents for malicious purposes, such as unauthorized access to sensitive information or automated exploitation of software vulnerabilities.

Building upon the significant advancements in LLMs [52\u201355] and advanced modality-mixing technologies [56, 57], groundbreaking MLLMs such as GPT-4V [1] and Gemini-Pro [42], along with open-source MLLMs like the LLaVA-1.6 series [2, 58], CogVLM [59], and Qwen-VL series [41], have shown outstanding performance across various tasks [60\u201365]. Venturing beyond text and single image, several studies are now exploring the integration of video modalities for tasks requiring dynamic or sequential visual content [44, 35, 66, 67]. In the GUI domain, leveraging the robust vision perception capabilities of MLLMs, applications such as WebAgents [8, 68, 23] and Mobile Agents [17, 12, 69] have gained popularity for handling everyday tasks like navigation and VQA. Frontier research is also investigating the use of MLLMs as general control agents, such as in playing computer games [70, 71] and serving as OS co-pilots [72, 24], paving the way for more complex GUI operations.\\n\\nGUI Benchmark & Dataset. Building upon the foundational work of Rico [13], the first mobile GUI video dataset, and AitW [16], which features 715k episodes of sequential images, research has extensively covered mobile [14, 73, 74] and web GUI environments [75, 19, 76\u201378]. Mind2Web [20] stands out in web-based datasets with over 2,000 tasks from 137 websites across 31 domains. Advances continue into desktop GUIs with new toolkits [23], benchmarks [21, 79], and frameworks [80, 81, 11]. Research on GUI also transfers from comprehending single images in a static workspace [8] to sequential operations or multi-hop scenarios [24, 22], challenging the understanding and operation capability of these powerful models.\\n\\nB Details of Dataset Construction\\n\\nB.1 Six Main GUI Categories\\n\\nIn earlier endeavors pertaining to GUI, such as those involving GUI testing [82\u201384], the focus was segmented into GUIs for Website, Software, IOS and Android platforms. However, as a comprehensive GUI dataset, we included all potential GUI scenarios into our dataset to ensure that our data is the most comprehensive knowledge that the GUI Agent needs to learn; we divided these scenarios into six categories:\\n\\n- **Android.** This category focuses on the GUI scenarios that occur within the Android operating system, which is predominantly used on smartphones. Android\u2019s ubiquity in the mobile market has led to a wide variety of GUI designs and interaction patterns, making it a rich field for study. This category has been the subject of extensive scrutiny in scholarly works such as [13, 73, 16, 85].\\n\\n- **Software.** This category encapsulates the GUI scenarios arising within software applications, whether they are standalone programs or components of a larger suite. The diversity of software applications, from productivity tools to creative suites, offers a wide range of GUI scenarios for exploration. The literature is rich with research in this area, such as [86].\\n\\n- **Website.** This category is concerned with the GUI scenarios that manifest within a web browser. Given the ubiquity of web browsing in modern digital life, this category holds significant relevance. It holds a substantial representation in academic literature, with pioneering papers such as [20, 21] proposing excellent GUI datasets for websites.\\n\\n- **IOS.** This category zeroes in on the GUI scenarios that transpire within the iOS operating system, the proprietary system for Apple devices like the iPhone and iPad. The iOS platform is known for its distinct design aesthetics and interaction patterns, providing a unique context for GUI research. A number of studies, such as [87, 88] make use of GUI information in IOS.\\n\\n- **Multi Windows.** This category is dedicated to GUI scenarios that necessitate simultaneous interaction with multiple windows, a common occurrence in desktop environments where users often juggle between several applications or documents. Despite the common use of multi-window interaction in everyday GUI usage, there has been relatively little research into this area [89]. The need for efficient multitasking in such scenarios presents unique challenges and opportunities for\"}"]}

As of our knowledge, there are no specific datasets catering to these multi-window GUI scenarios.\\n\\n- **XR.** XR encompasses Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR), and Mixed Reality (MR) [90]. Given the advancements in XR technology and the growing accessibility of commercial-grade head-mounted displays [25, 91], XR has emerged as a novel medium for human-computer interaction. This necessitates the exploration of GUI within XR environments. In these scenarios, the GUI takes on a 3D, immersive form [92], demanding the agent to comprehend and navigate a 3D space. The emerging field of XR presents a new frontier for GUI research, with unique challenges and opportunities due to its immersive and interactive nature. To date, as far as we are aware, there are no datasets that specifically address GUI in the realm of XR.\\n\\n### B.2 Selected Website/Software\\n\\nIn our study, we selected a diverse range of websites and software to comprehensively evaluate GUI understanding capabilities across various user scenarios. These selections cover essential categories such as social media, productivity tools, online shopping, and educational platforms, providing a broad spectrum of GUI environments.\\n\\nThe chosen websites, as shown in Figure 7, include popular social media platforms like Instagram, Twitter, and LinkedIn, which are integral to understanding dynamic and interactive GUI elements. We also included widely used productivity tools such as Microsoft Teams, Notion, and Slack to evaluate GUI tasks in professional and collaborative settings.\\n\\nFor software shown in Figure 8, we incorporated key applications like Adobe Photoshop and MATLAB to assess GUI operations in specialized and technical environments. Additionally, video conferencing tools like Zoom and cloud storage services like Google Drive were included to represent common remote work and file management scenarios.\\n\\nThese selections ensure that our study encompasses a wide array of user interactions and GUI complexities, thereby providing a robust evaluation of the current state-of-the-art in GUI understanding by MLLMs and comprehensively constructing a high-quality dataset.\\n\\n### B.3 Human Keyframes Annotation Process\\n\\n**Annotator\u2019s Information** The annotation is conducted by 16 authors of this paper and 8 volunteers independently. As acknowledged, the diversity of annotators plays a crucial role in reducing bias and enhancing the reliability of the benchmark. These annotators have knowledge in the GUI domain, with different genders, ages, and educational backgrounds. The education backgrounds of annotators are above undergraduate. To ensure the annotators can proficiently mark the data, we provide them with detailed tutorials, teaching them how to use software to record videos or edit video clips. We also provide them with detailed criteria and task requirements in each annotation process.\\n\\n**Recording Video.** For self-recording videos, we employ OBS\\\\(^3\\\\) on the Windows system for screen capturing and the official screen recording toolkit on the Mac/IOS system. This process necessitates human labelers to execute a series of targeted actions within specific websites or applications, which are subsequently captured as raw video footage. These actions, commonplace in everyday usage, enhance the reliability of our dataset. Subsequently, the raw videos are segmented into sub-videos, each encapsulating multiple actions (e.g., clicking a button) to achieve a specific objective (e.g., image search). The videos are then processed to extract keyframes annotated with detailed descriptions.\\n\\n**Edition Based on YouTube Videos.** For sourcing videos from YouTube, we utilize a search protocol formatted as \\\"[website name/application name] + tutorial\\\" to compile relevant video lists. Human labelers first review these videos to understand the primary operations they depict. These videos are then divided into sub-videos, each containing several actions directed towards a\\n\\n\\\\(^3\\\\)https://obsproject.com/\"}"]}
