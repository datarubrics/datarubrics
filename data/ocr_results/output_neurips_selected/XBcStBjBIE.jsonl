Compared to existing benchmarks that focus on visual quality and text relevance of generated videos, *ChronoMagic-Bench* focuses on the models\u2019 ability to generate time-lapse videos with significant metamorphic amplitude and temporal coherence. The benchmark probes T2V models for their physics, biology, and chemistry capabilities, in a free-form text control. For these purposes, *ChronoMagic-Bench* introduces 1,649 prompts and real-world videos as references, categorized into four major types of time-lapse videos: biological, human creation, meteorological, and physical phenomena, which are further divided into 75 subcategories. This categorization ensures a comprehensive evaluation of the models\u2019 capacity to handle diverse and complex transformations. To accurately align human preference on the benchmark, we introduce two new automatic metrics, MTScore and CHScore, to evaluate the videos\u2019 metamorphic attributes and temporal coherence. MTScore measures the metamorphic amplitude, reflecting the degree of change over time, while CHScore assesses the temporal coherence, ensuring the generated videos maintain logical progression and continuity. Based on the *ChronoMagic-Bench*, we conduct comprehensive manual evaluations of eighteen representative T2V models, revealing their strengths and weaknesses across different categories of prompts, providing a thorough evaluation framework that addresses current gaps in video generation research. More encouragingly, we create a large-scale *ChronoMagic-Pro* dataset, containing 460k high-quality pairs of 720p time-lapse videos and detailed captions. Each caption ensures high physical content and large metamorphic amplitude, which have a far-reaching impact on the video generation community.\\n\\n1 Introduction\\n\\nText-to-video (T2V) generative models [89,88,94,96,43,23,76,69] have developed rapidly recently.

Additionally, the evaluation metrics they use mainly focus on visual quality and textual relevance, from early metrics like FID [26], FVD [71], and CLIPScore [25] to more recent ones like UMTScore [47], T2VQA [33], and UMT-FVD [47], all of which overlook two other crucial aspects of videos: metamorphic amplitude and temporal coherence. These limitations hinder the development of T2V models in generating videos with rich physical content.\\n\\nDue to the greater metamorphic amplitude and temporal coherence of time-lapse videos, they contain more physical priors compared to general videos [89]. Therefore, to address the aforementioned issues, we introduce a benchmark called *ChronoMagic-Bench* for Metamorphic Evaluation of Time-Lapse Text-to-Video Generation, which provides a comprehensive evaluation system for T2V. We specifically designed four major categories for time-lapse videos, including biological, human creation, meteorological, and physical, and extended these to 75 subcategories. Based on this, we constructed *ChronoMagic-Bench*, comprising 1,649 prompts and their corresponding reference time-lapse videos. As shown in Table 1 compared to existing benchmarks [66, 83, 47, 28, 79, 68], *ChronoMagic-Bench* emphasizes generating videos with high persistence and strong variation, i.e., metamorphic videos with high physical prior content. Additionally, we developed MTScore for evaluating metamorphic amplitude and CHScore for temporal coherence to address the deficiencies in evaluation metrics and perspectives. With *ChronoMagic-Bench*, we conducted comprehensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations of almost all open&closed-source T2V models, enabling analysis of their strengths and weaknesses. The results highlighted the weaknesses of these models, including (1) almost all models fail to generate time-lapse videos with large variations; (2) poor adherence to prompts, necessitating multiple inferences to achieve satisfactory results; (3) the visual quality of single frame may be high, but flickering may occur, indicating poor temporal coherence.\\n\\nFurthermore, we have meticulously curated the dataset *ChronoMagic-Pro* to provide the community with the first large-scale T2V dataset specifically designed for time-lapse video generation with higher physical prior content. *ChronoMagic-Pro* stands out from previous T2V datasets [83, 2, 77, 16, 75] as it comprises time-lapse videos (e.g., ice melting and flowers blooming) characterized by strong physical characteristics, high persistence, and variability. Considering the domain differences between time-lapse videos and general videos, we proposed an automatic time-lapse video collection framework to maintain video purity and improve annotation quality.\\n\\nThe contributions of this work are as follows:\\n\\n**i) New T2V Benchmark.** We introduce *ChronoMagic-Bench* for comprehensive evaluation of T2V models, focusing on visual quality, text relevance, metamorphic amplitude, and temporal coherence.\\n\\n**ii) New Automatic Metrics.** We develop MTScore and CHScore, which align better with human judgment than existing metrics, for assessing metamorphic attributes and temporal coherence.\\n\\n**iii) New Insights for T2V Model Selection.** Our evaluations using *ChronoMagic-Bench* provide crucial insights into the strengths and weaknesses of various T2V models.\\n\\n**iv) Large-Scale Time-lapse Video-Text Dataset.** We create *ChronoMagic-Pro*, a dataset with 460k high-quality 720p time-lapse videos and detailed captions, promoting advances in T2V research.\"}"]}

For example, FETV [47] enhances FVD and CLIPScore within the UMT [39] feature space, resulting in UMT-FVD and UMTScore. Additionally, the CLIPScore feature extractor can be replaced with BLIP [92] to evaluate the relevance between text and generated content. To the best of our knowledge, existing T2V benchmarks [46, 47, 87, 18, 55] mainly assess these two aspects, with prompts based on general videos. This means that temporal coherence and metamorphic amplitude in videos have been overlooked, leading to the absence of automated metrics that indirectly reflect the physical content encoded by video models. Although [47, 28, 46] assess coherence, they are based on feature space or human evaluation, which is expensive and not sufficiently intuitive. Therefore, we propose the Metamorphic Score (MTScore) and Coherence Score (CHScore) to measure the metamorphic degree and temporal coherence of videos, filling this gap in the field.\\n\\n**Datasets for Text-to-Video Generation.** Large-scale high-quality text-content pair data [10, 67, 56, 27] are essential for training generation models [93, 19, 59, 58, 51, 52, 14, 54, 40, 6, 7, 24, 53, 91, 65]. To enable models to learn better representation spaces that simulate the real world, the larger the dataset and the richer the physical knowledge contained in the videos, the better the training effect. Researchers often construct these large-scale datasets through web scraping. For example, existing video generation models typically use WebVid-10M [2], which contains 10 million videos and captions. Recently released datasets, such as Panda-70M [16], HD-VG-130M [75], and InternVid [77], contain 70 million, 130 million, and 7.1 million text-video pairs, respectively. Despite their large sizes, these datasets consist of general videos with small metamorphic amplitude and short persistence of change, resulting in limited physical knowledge. Consequently, models trained on these datasets struggle to generate metamorphic videos. To address this issue, we propose the first large-scale dataset of time-lapse videos, comprising 460k 720P resolution video clips and their corresponding captions, which features strong persistence of changes, and high physical content.\\n\\n## 3 ChronoMagic-Bench\\n\\n### 3.1 Benchmark Construction\\n\\n**Prompt Construction.** To comprehensively evaluate the time-lapse video generation capabilities of existing T2V models, the designed text prompts need to cover as many metamorphic types as possible, and the corresponding reference videos must be of relatively high quality. Manual construction is impractical; therefore, to build a T2V benchmark rich in visual concepts, we first manually created a search term database suitable for diverse and broadly applicable time-lapse videos. We then counted the number of videos obtainable for each search term and filtered them based on frequency, resulting in a search database containing 75 categories of time-lapse videos.

We then utilized a search engine to crawl 20 or more high-quality videos from video platforms for each category, ultimately gathering a total of 1,649 videos. Finally, we use GPT-4o [1] to accurately caption these videos and treat these captions as the text prompts for the benchmark. For more details about benchmark construction, please refer to Appendix E.\\n\\n**Benchmark Statistics.** We collect a total of 1,649 prompts with corresponding videos and categories, the specific data distribution is shown in Figure 2, indicating that 75 categories have a comparable number of test cases to reflect the time-lapse video generation capabilities of different models accurately. Each data sample in ChronoMagic-Bench consists of four elements: prompt $p$, reference video $v$, sub-category $c_1$, and major category $c_2$. Since existing T2V models typically use CLIP as the text encoder, which supports a maximum input of 77 tokens, we have limited the length of $p$ to within 77 tokens for general applicability, as shown in Figure 3(a). Although the length is limited, the diversity remains rich. By comparing the main words in the word cloud, as shown in Figure 3(b), it is observed that terms related to time-lapse videos such as \\\"transitioning,\\\" \\\"progressing,\\\" \\\"increasing,\\\" and \\\"gradually\\\" appear most frequently. These terms significantly highlight ChronoMagic-Bench\u2019s focus on large metamorphic amplitude, strong persistence of changes, and high physical content. In addition, words from four major categories are distributed, such as biological (seed, butterfly, etc.), human creation (Minecraft, traffic, etc), meteorological (sunset, tide, etc), and physical (burning, explosion, etc). For detailed explanations of the 75 subcategories, please refer to the Appendix E.\"}"]}

This indicates a lack of metrics for evaluating the capability to generate time-lapse videos, which not only need to measure the aforementioned two aspects but also need to assess metamorphic amplitude and temporal coherence.\\n\\n**Metamorphic Score.** To the best of our knowledge, there is no existing automated evaluation metric for assessing metamorphic amplitude. A simple way is to use questionnaires or GPT-4o [1], which, although highly effective, is expensive. Another way is to use the open-source model [78], which, although less effective, is much cheaper. To address this, we propose both coarse-grained and fine-grained scores to measure the metamorphic amplitude, aiming to balance cost and performance.\\n\\nFor the coarse-grained score (i.e. MTScore), we initially designed $N$ retrieval sentences (please refer to Appendix B.1 for more details). We then input these sentences into a video retrieval model [78], resulting in the computation of probabilities for $n$ metamorphic and $m$ general videos. Let $P_{i}^{\\\\text{meta}}$ and $P_{i}^{\\\\text{gen}}$ represent the probabilities for the $i$-th metamorphic and general retrieval sentences, respectively. We then integrate these probabilities to derive a coarse-grained metamorphic score $S_c$:\\n\\n$$S_c = \\\\frac{\\\\sum_{i=1}^{n} P_{i}^{\\\\text{meta}}}{\\\\sum_{i=1}^{n} P_{i}^{\\\\text{meta}}} + \\\\sum_{i=1}^{m} P_{i}^{\\\\text{gen}}$$\\n\\nDue to the strong instruction-following capability and world-understanding ability of GPT-4o, it can partially replace humans. For the fine-grained score (GPT4o-MTScore), we use GPT-4o as the evaluator. Specifically, we set a 5-point evaluation standard, then uniformly sample $T$ frames and input them into GPT-4o[1] to get the score. More implementation details are provided in Appendix B.\\n\\n**Temporal Coherence Score.** Temporal coherence is crucial for time-lapse videos because they span a large time range. Current benchmarks assess coherence either through questionnaires [47] or by employing methods based on feature space calculations [28, 46]. The former approach is time-consuming, whereas the latter lacks intuitiveness and does not support visualization. Therefore, we developed the Coherence Score (CHScore) based on a video tracking model [29] as shown in Algorithm 1. More details are provided in the Appendix B.2. First, we process the input video using a pre-trained model with grid size $G$ and threshold $T$ to obtain $p_{vis}[i, j]$ (the visibility of point $j$ in frame $i$). Next, we count the number of missing tracking points $m[i]$ in each frame and the change in missed points between consecutive frames $\\\\Delta m[i]$. To make the CHScore robust to the temporally coherent disappearance of points, we further calculate the direction of camera/object movement.\"}"]}

If the tracking point j of frame i disappears in the far direction, it is not included in the calculation of $m[i]$. We then calculate the average proportion of missed points per frame $R_{missed}$, indicating the overall visibility issue across the video. Following this, we compute the variation in the number of missed points between consecutive frames $V_{missed}$, measuring frame-to-frame coherence. We also determine the ratio of frames that need to be cut $R_{cut}$, reflecting the extent of video editing required, and count the number of consecutive changes in missed points exceeding the threshold $C_{missed}$, indicating frequent large-scale instability in point tracking. Additionally, we measure the maximum continuous change in missed points $M_{missed}$, highlighting the most severe continuity breaks in the video. Finally, we integrate these metrics to calculate the Coherence Score (CHScore). In the subsequent section, the actual CHScore is scaled by 0.1 to provide a more concise representation. Further details can be found in the appendix B.2.\\n\\n3.3 Application Scope\\n\\nChronoMagic-Bench proposes automatic scores for measuring *metamorphic amplitude* and *temporal coherence*. When combined with existing metrics for *visual quality* and *textual relevance*, such as FVD [71], CLIPScore [25], UMT-FVD [47], and UMTScore [47], a comprehensive evaluation of T2V models across four dimensions can be achieved. Additionally, we can use human evaluation to more accurately assess these four dimensions.\\n\\n4 ChronoMagic-Pro\\n\\n**Multi-Aspect Data Curation.** As previously mentioned, existing large-scale text-video datasets primarily consist of general videos with limited physical information content, restricting open-source models [6, 66, 23] to generating only general videos rather than time-lapse videos. To address this, we construct the first large-scale time-lapse video dataset by collecting time-lapse videos based on the search terms outlined in Section 3.1, ultimately obtaining 66,226 original videos. Following the Panda70m method [16], we split these videos to produce 460K semantically consistent single-scene video clips. Finally, we utilize the video annotation strategy similar to MagicTime [89], replacing GPT-4V [1] with the open-source ShareGPT4Video [13] to reduce computational overhead while ensuring high-quality video captions. We conduct a verification experiment on the dataset in the Appendix D.3. More details about dataset construction are provided in Appendix C.\\n\\n**Dataset Statistics.** We collected time-lapse videos from 75 categories manually set by the human, with proportions being roughly similar. Some samples can be found in the Appendix C.4. ChronoMagic-Pro is the first high-quality large-scale time-lapse T2V dataset, which contains more physical knowledge than general videos, as shown in Table 2. As shown in Figure 4, in terms of duration, more than half (53.3%) of the videos have a duration of 0-15 seconds, a quarter (27.1%) are longer than 60 seconds, 12.1% are between 15-30 seconds, and the remaining videos are distributed between 30-60 seconds. Regarding resolution, 97% are high resolution (720P), 2% are ultra-high resolution (1080P), and the remaining videos have lower resolutions ranging from 360P to 480P. As the number of words accepted by the text encoder increases, we require the generated captions to be as detailed as possible, with 95% of captions containing more than 100 words. For aesthetic score [64], 73% videos get high scores ranging from 4 to 6. 14% of the videos had aesthetic indicators exceeding 6, and only a small portion of the videos scored below 3.

We also selected four closed-source models for evaluation, specifically U-Net based: Gen-2 [63], Pika-1.0 [36], DiT-based: Dream Machine [48], and KeLing [35]. All inference settings follow the official implementation. For more details, please refer to the Appendix D.\\n\\n### 5.2 Evaluation Setups\\n\\n**Evaluation Criteria.** We assess video quality primarily from the following four aspects: (a) **Visual Quality** measures the clarity, color saturation, contrast, and overall aesthetic effect, using UMT-FVD [47], an enhanced version of FVD [71]. (b) **Text Relevance** measures the correlation between the prompt and the video using UMTScore [47], an enhanced version of CLIPScore [25]. (c) **Metamorphic Amplitude** measures the diversity and dynamic changes in the video content, using the proposed Metamorphic Score. (d) **Temporal Coherence** measures the smoothness and logical sequence of the video content over time, using the proposed Coherence Score. Additionally, we use human evaluation to cross-verify the reliability of the four metrics.\\n\\n**Implementation Details.** For each baseline, we generate corresponding triple results based on the 1,649 prompts contained in the ChronoMagic-Bench, resulting in 4,947 videos for each model. We then use the four automated metrics mentioned above to assess all the generated videos.\"}"]}

All input texts are from our ChronoMagic-Bench. Unlike existing benchmarks that only assess general videos, our evaluation task focuses on generating metamorphic videos, such as the construction of houses in Minecraft, the blooming of flowers, the baking of bread rolls, and the melting of ice cubes. As shown in Figure 5, almost all U-Net-based and DiT-based models are limited to generating general videos and fail to follow prompts to produce videos with significant motion and temporal spans, except for MagicTime [89] and CogVideoX [86] (training data contains time-lapse videos), which underscores the importance of ChronoMagic-Pro dataset. Since T2V-Zero [30] is a zero-shot video generation model, its coherence is significantly lacking, although its visual quality is acceptable. Among the emerging DiT-based video models, CogVideoX [86] and OpenSora v1.2 [96] stands out as a representative that matches the performance of U-Net based methods, followed by EasyAnimate V3 [23], OpenSoraPlan v1.1 [43], while Latte [49] shows poor text-following capability.\\n\\n**Qualitative Evaluation.** Next, we present and analyze the results of different T2V models from a qualitative perspective as shown in Table 3. Consistent with Figure 5, MagicTime [89] and CogVideoX [86], as the only model capable of generating metamorphic videos, has the highest MTScore and GPT4o-MTScore among all models. The other models, trained only on general videos, produce videos with limited motion range due to the minimal physical knowledge encoded in the models. It can also be seen that the results of the MTScore based on feature space with lower overhead and the GPT4o-MTScore based on question answering with higher overhead are roughly similar, proving the effectiveness of the proposed indicators. Additionally, ZeroScope [69] has limited metamorphic amplitude but the best coherence, while the zero-shot algorithm T2V-Zero [30] has the lowest CHScore. U-Net based and DiT-based models have similar CHScore, but the former shows superior average metamorphic amplitude. For visual quality and text relevance, the emerging CogVideoX [86] and EasyAnimate [82] performed best. The OpenSoraPlan v1.1 [43] and OpenSora 1.1&1.2 [96] have visual quality comparable to U-Net based methods, but slightly inferior text relevance. Only MagicTime [89] and CogVideoX [86] follows the prompt to generate\"}"]}

We randomly select the generated videos corresponding to 16 prompts and invited 212 participants to vote, obtaining manual evaluation results. To enhance user satisfaction, we select only six representative baseline results and reference videos from which users can choose. Figure 6 shows the correlation between automatic metrics and human perception. It is evident that the proposed three metrics, MTScore, CHScore, and GPT4o-MTScore, are consistent with human perception and can accurately reflect the metamorphic amplitude and temporal coherence of T2V models. Additionally, as mentioned earlier, UMTScore [47] cannot accurately measure text relevance, especially in the evaluation of time-lapse videos, where its Kendall and Spearman coefficients are the lowest. We infer that its feature space is not suitable for time-lapse video. For more details please refer to Appendix D.\\n\\n**Extended Analysis of Closed-Source Models** In this section, we explore the performance and limitations of closed-source models. Given the impracticality of manually testing all 1,649 prompts in ChronoMagic-Bench, we selected two hard prompts from each of the 75 categories, resulting in ChronoMagic-Bench-150. We first analyze the results from a quantitative perspective. As shown in Table 4, with Dream Machine [48] performing better in metamorphic amplitude (MTScore, GPT4o-MTScore) and Pika-1.0 [36] showing the worst text relevance (UMTScore). DiT-based methods outperform U-Net based ones in visual quality. To facilitate comparison under a unified standard, we also test open-source models on ChronoMagic-Bench-150. It is evident that for most models, the MTScore and GPT4o-MTScore are low, and they are unable to generate videos involving complex state changes. Additionally, due to the inherent limitations of UMT-FVD [47] and UMTScore [47], they fail to accurately reflect the differences between open-source and closed-source models. However, the qualitative analysis across all models demonstrates that closed-source models consistently surpass open-source models in visual quality and textual relevance. Furthermore, it is worth noting that the results within the same domain (open/closed) align with human evaluations. We also conduct a detailed qualitative analysis, please refer to Appendix D.5 for more details.\"}"]}

To verify the validity and robustness of the ChronoMagic-Pro, we conducted quantitative validation based on OpenSoraPlan v1.1 [43]. Specifically, we fine-tuned the temporal module of the OpenSoraPlan v1.1 model using the Magic Training Strategy [89], based on the weights of OpenSoraPlan v1.1 [43]. Due to limited computational resources, we randomly selected only 10,000 video-text pairs from ChronoMagic-Pro for training. The results are shown in Table 3. After fine-tuning with ChronoMagic-Pro, the visual quality (i.e., UMT-FVD), text relevance (i.e., UMTScore), and metamorphic amplitude (i.e., MTScore and GPT4o-MTScore) were all effectively improved. Moreover, we utilized a straightforward method (e.g., full parameters) to fine-tune the model; however, the results suggest that this is less effective than the Magic Training Strategy [89]. More details and qualitative analysis are provided in Appendix D.3.\\n\\nGuideline for Model Selection. With the increasing number of T2V models, the community faces challenges in selecting the most appropriate model due to the tendency of each model to showcase its best results. To address this issue, we provide a guideline for model selection based on the evaluation results of ChronoMagic-Bench: (a) Except for MagicTime [89], CogVideoX [86] and Dream Machine [48], most T2V models exhibit minimal metamorphic amplitude and cannot generate complete processes rich in physical changes, such as seed germination, sunrise, or building construction; (b) The visual quality of a single frame may be high, but when viewed in sequence, flickering often occurs, indicating poor temporal coherence. This issue is particularly evident in T2V-zero [30] and OpenSora 1.2 [96], whereas closed-source models do not exhibit this problem; (c) The emergence of Sora [9] has promoted the rapid development of DiT-based methods. Closed-source models based on DiT have comprehensively surpassed those based on U-Net. However, most open-source models\u2019 visual quality, text-following capability, and metamorphic amplitude still lag behind U-Net-based methods. We speculate that DiT-based models are more scalable and require more data, giving closed-source models a significant advantage over open-source models; (d) It is expensive to access massive data and computing resources. First, they can build datasets by crawling videos without copyright disputes. Second, adopting the U-DiT architecture may balance performance and cost to a certain extent; (e) Ordinary users who want to try T2V models can prioritize Dream Machine [48] and KeLing [35]. Researchers who wish to conduct in-depth research on T2V can prioritize the study of metamorphic video generation with CogVideoX [86], EasyAnimate [82], OpenSoraPlan [43] and OpenSora [96], as neither open-source nor closed-source models can achieve this function.\\n\\n6 Conclusion\\n\\nIn this paper, we present ChronoMagic-Bench, the first benchmark specifically designed to assess the generation of time-lapse videos. It addresses the shortcomings of current benchmarks, which primarily focus on standard videos and overlook critical elements such as metamorphic amplitude and coherence. Additionally, we introduce two new automated metrics, MTScore and CHScore, which align with human perception. Based on ChronoMagic-Bench, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of almost all open&closed-source leading text-to-video (T2V) models and provide crucial insights into the strengths and weaknesses of various models. Moreover, we propose ChronoMagic-Pro, the first large-scale time-lapse T2V dataset, to facilitate further research by the community.\\n\\n7 Limitations and Future Work\\n\\nWhile ChronoMagic-Bench offers a robust evaluation framework, there are still two limitations of this work. (1) The majority of the data is sourced from YouTube, where video quality varies significantly, necessitating extensive filtering based on aesthetic criteria, views, and likes. Additionally, most videos are licensed under CC BY 4.0, limiting their use to academic research. (2) Despite introducing MTScore and CHScore for metamorphic attributes and temporal coherence, a clear gap remains between these existing metrics and human preferences. Future efforts will focus on aligning automated metrics more closely with human judgment for a more accurate evaluation of T2V models.\\n\\n8 Acknowledgments\\n\\nWe thank all the anonymous reviewers for their constructive comments.

Existing T2V architectures can be categorized into two types: U-Net-based and DiT-based. The former typically builds on Stable Diffusion [62], extending the 2D U-Net to a 3D U-Net by adding temporal layers, thereby achieving high-quality video generation [74, 15, 23, 4, 11, 41]. The latter focuses on recreating open-source structures similar to Sora [9], using the DiT (Diffusion-Transformer) [57] framework for T2V generation [43, 96, 94, 20]. However, the generation quality of DiT-based architectures still lags behind that of U-Net-based architectures. MagicTime [89] notes that although these models have achieved basic video generation, the videos are typically limited to simple actions and scenes, resulting in the production of general videos rather than those enriched with physical priors like metamorphic/time-lapse videos. For a more intuitive representation, we have detailed a comparison of the metamorphic video generation capabilities of different algorithms.\"}"]}
{"id": "XBcStBjBIE", "page_num": 19, "content": ["{\"primary_language\":\"en\",\"is_rotation_valid\":true,\"rotation_correction\":0,\"is_table\":false,\"is_diagram\":false,\"natural_text\":\"B More details about Automatic Metrics\\n\\nB.1 Construction of retrieval sentences for Metamorphic Score\\n\\nTo obtain an effective Metamorphic Score (MTScore), we meticulously designed ten distinct retrieval texts to differentiate between time-lapse and normal videos. Although, in theory, only two retrieval sentences are needed to distinguish between general and time-lapse videos, multiple texts were used to enhance the model\u2019s robustness and accuracy. This approach also provides diverse linguistic representations for each video category, ensuring comprehensive coverage and minimizing bias. As shown in Table 5, the first five sentences (Index 0-4) describe general videos, capturing standard, unaltered video content in unique phrasings. The last five sentences (Index 5-9) describe time-lapse videos, characterized by accelerated playback or condensed time sequences, also phrased in various ways to capture different nuances. When calculating the MTScore, the video retrieval model uses these texts to evaluate each frame of the video, assigning probabilities based on the matches. The final result is obtained by summing the general probability and the metamorphic probability. For GPT4o-MTScore, we used a five-point rating scale and provided detailed scoring guidelines in the prompt, as shown in Table 6.\\n\\nTable 5: Retrieval sentences for coarse-grained score (MTScore)\\n\\n| Index | Sentence |\\n|-------|----------|\\n| 1     | A conventional video, not a time-condensed video. |\\n| 2     | A usual video, not an accelerated video sequence. |\\n| 3     | A normal video, not a time-lapse video. |\\n| 4     | A standard video, not a time-lapse. |\\n| 5     | An ordinary video, different from a fast-motion video. |\\n| 6     | A time-lapse video, distinct from a regular recording. |\\n| 7     | A time-lapse footage, not your typical video. |\\n| 8     | A fast-motion video, unlike a standard video. |\\n| 9     | A time-condensed video, not a conventional video. |\\n| 10    | An accelerated video sequence, not a usual video. |\\n\\nTable 6: Scoring Criteria for GPT4o-MTScore. We set guidelines for each score to ensure that GPT-4o makes choices based on consistent criteria.\\n\\n| Score | Brief Reasoning Statement |\\n|-------|---------------------------|\\n| 1     | Minimal change. The scene appears almost like a still image, with static elements remaining motionless and only minor changes in lighting or subtle movements of elements. No significant activity is noticeable. |\\n| 2     | Slight change. There is a small amount of movement or change in the elements of the scene, such as a few people or vehicles moving and minor changes in light or shadows. The overall variation is still minimal, with changes mostly being quantitative. |\\n| 3     | Moderate change. Multiple elements in the scene undergo changes, but the overall pace is slow. This includes gradual changes in daylight, moving clouds, growing plants, or occasional vehicle and pedestrian movements. The scene begins to show a transition from quantitative to qualitative change. |\\n| 4     | Significant change. The elements in the scene show obvious dynamic changes with a higher speed and frequency of variation. This includes noticeable changes in city traffic, crowd activities, or significant weather transitions. The scene displays a mix of quantitative and qualitative changes. |\\n| 5     | Dramatic change. Elements in the scene undergo continuous and rapid significant changes, creating a very rich visual effect. This includes events like sunrise and sunset, construction of buildings, and seasonal changes, making the variation process vivid and impactful. The scene exhibits clear qualitative change. |\\n\\nB.2 Further Description of Temporal Coherence Score\\n\\nWe present a detailed description of the algorithm for computing the Temporal Coherence Score. Specifically, we first process input video using the pre-trained model with grid size $G$ and threshold $T$ to get visibility of point $p_{vis}$. Then, we count the number of missing tracking points $m[i]$ in each frame, and the change in missed points between consecutive frames $\\\\Delta m[i]$: \"}"]}

To make the CHScore robust to temporally coherent disappearance of points, we first calculate the direction of camera/object movement based on the tracking points across all frames. Then, if the tracking point \\\\( j \\\\) of frame \\\\( i \\\\) disappears in the far direction, it is not included in the calculation of \\\\( m[i] \\\\). Based on these, we then calculate the \\\\( R_{\\\\text{missed}} \\\\), which represents the average proportion of missed points per frame in the video. And the \\\\( V_{\\\\text{missed}} \\\\), which measures the variation in the number of missed points between consecutive frames, indicating frame-to-frame coherence:\\n\\n\\\\[ R_{\\\\text{missed}} = \\\\frac{1}{F} \\\\sum_{i=1}^{F} m[i] \\\\]\\n\\n\\\\[ V_{\\\\text{missed}} = \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{1}{F-1} \\\\sum_{i=1}^{F-1} (\\\\Delta m[i] - \\\\bar{\\\\Delta m})^2} \\\\]\\n\\nwhere \\\\( \\\\Delta m[i] = m[i + 1] - m[i] \\\\), \\\\( \\\\bar{\\\\Delta m} \\\\) is the mean of \\\\( \\\\Delta m[i] \\\\), \\\\( F \\\\) is the total number of frames and \\\\( N \\\\) is the number of points per frame. In addition, we need to calculate the \\\\( R_{\\\\text{cut}} \\\\), which indicates the ratio of frames that need to be cut to the total number of frames, reflecting the extent of video editing required. And the \\\\( C_{\\\\text{missed}} \\\\), which indicates the number of consecutive changes in missed points exceeding the threshold, indicating frequent large-scale instability in point tracking:\\n\\n\\\\[ R_{\\\\text{cut}} = \\\\frac{|\\\\{i : \\\\Delta m[i] > T\\\\}|}{F} \\\\]\\n\\n\\\\[ C_{\\\\text{missed}} = \\\\sum_{\\\\Delta m[i] > T} \\\\Delta m[i] \\\\]\\n\\nwhere \\\\( T \\\\) is the threshold for significant missed point variation, and \\\\( |\\\\{i : \\\\Delta m[i] > T\\\\}| \\\\) represents the number of frames with significant missed point variation. Then we calculate the \\\\( M_{\\\\text{missed}} \\\\), which measures the maximum continuous change in missed points, reflecting the most severe continuity breaks in the video, and finally get the Coherence Score (CHScore):\\n\\n\\\\[ \\\\text{CHScore} = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\lambda_1 \\\\hat{R}_{\\\\text{missed}} + \\\\lambda_2 \\\\hat{V}_{\\\\text{missed}} + \\\\lambda_3 \\\\hat{R}_{\\\\text{cut}} + \\\\lambda_4 \\\\hat{C}_{\\\\text{missed}} + \\\\lambda_5 \\\\hat{M}_{\\\\text{missed}}} \\\\]\\n\\nwhere \\\\( \\\\hat{X} \\\\) represents the normalized variable, and \\\\( \\\\lambda_x \\\\) denotes the corresponding weight coefficient. For the setting of \\\\( \\\\lambda_1 \\\\) to \\\\( \\\\lambda_5 \\\\), we follow the following principles. Specifically, \\\\( R_{\\\\text{missed}} \\\\) is a global metric representing the model\u2019s overall performance across the entire video and holds the highest significance, with a weight of \\\\( \\\\lambda_1 = 0.35 \\\\). \\\\( V_{\\\\text{missed}} \\\\) measures the stability of missed points between frames, a critical aspect of video analysis, and is therefore assigned a weight of \\\\( \\\\lambda_2 = 0.25 \\\\). \\\\( R_{\\\\text{cut}} \\\\) indicates abnormal situations and carries a weight of \\\\( \\\\lambda_3 = 0.15 \\\\). \\\\( C_{\\\\text{missed}} \\\\), similar in function to the \\\\( R_{\\\\text{cut}} \\\\), serves as a secondary indicator, also weighted at \\\\( \\\\lambda_4 = 0.15 \\\\). Lastly, \\\\( M_{\\\\text{missed}} \\\\) represents individual extreme cases and is assigned a lower weight of \\\\( \\\\lambda_5 = 0.10 \\\\).\\n\\n### B.3 Details of Temporally Coherent Disappearance of Points\\n\\nThe 'Temporally coherent disappearance of points' describes the phenomenon where tracking points vanish over time due to movements such as camera movement or water flow, potentially causing these points to exit the camera\u2019s field of view. To prevent this from influencing the CHScore calculation, we initially identify the direction of change for various points within the video, as depicted in Figure 7. Subsequently, points that vanish proximate to this directional endpoint are excluded from the CHScore calculation.\"}"]}

Additionally, since our training data is sourced from video platforms (e.g., YouTube) where videos are designed to engage the audience, they inherently contain many transitions (significant changes in content during video playback). To address this issue, we follow the method described in Panda70M [16] to split the videos into multiple semantically consistent single-scene clips. Specifically, OpenCV [8] initially splits the video by analyzing pixel differences between adjacent frames. Let $I_t$ be the image frame at time $t$; the difference between two adjacent frames can be computed as:\\n\\n$$D_t = \\\\sum_{i=1}^{H} \\\\sum_{j=1}^{W} |I_t(i, j) - I_{t+1}(i, j)|$$  \\\\hspace{1cm} (10)\"}"]}

And finally let ShareGPT4Video [13] summarize the video caption based on these captions and their frame positions.\\n\\nwhere $H$ and $W$ are the height and width of the frame, and $i$ and $j$ represent pixel positions, respectively. Videos are split into clips where $D_t$ exceeds a certain threshold $\\\\tau$. Then, the ImageBind model [22] recombines erroneously split clips by analyzing feature space differences between adjacent clips. Let $\\\\phi(I_t)$ represent the feature vector of frame $I_t$ obtained from the ImageBind model. The feature space difference between adjacent clips $C_i$ and $C_{i+1}$ can be computed as:\\n\\n$$F_i = \\\\|\\\\phi(I_{t_i}) - \\\\phi(I_{t_{i+1}})\\\\|_2$$\\n\\n(11)\\n\\nwhere $t_i$ and $t_{i+1}$ are the times of the last frame of $C_i$ and the first frame of $C_{i+1}$, respectively.

This process results in semantically consistent single-scene video clips.\\n\\n### C.2 Time-Aware Annotation\\n\\nAfter obtaining high-quality time-lapse video clips, it is crucial to add appropriate captions. The simplest approach is to input the video clips into a large multimodal model to generate text descriptions of the video content. However, our experiments found that the 8B [44], 13B [84], and 34B [38] models could not accurately describe the content of time-lapse videos, resulting in severe hallucinations, as shown in Figure 10. Therefore, we decided to follow the annotation strategy of MagicTime [89]. Unlike MagicTime, due to higher costs, we adopted an open-source model [13] instead of the closed-source GPT-4V [1]. As shown in Figure 10, we first uniformly sample $N$ frames from each video segment, input these $N$ frames into the multimodal large model to describe the content, and finally have the model summarize the final video captions based on the textual descriptions of $N$ frames and the corresponding position of each frame in the video.

These samples illustrate the dataset\u2019s diversity and depth, encompassing biological, human creation, meteorological, and physical categories, designed to support advanced research in high-dynamic text-to-video generation and related fields.

The aesthetic detector exhibits inherent biases, favoring artistic images, such as oil paintings and other art forms, over more realistic styles. Consequently, low aesthetic scores do not necessarily indicate poor-quality data. Retaining a small portion of such data can enhance the diversity of the videos. Thus, we include 13% of clips with low aesthetic scores in ChronoMagic-Pro.\\n\\n2. There are two types of time-lapse videos: compressed and uncompressed. The former represents the entire process in a few seconds, while the latter can last for several minutes or even tens of minutes. ChronoMagic consists of compressed videos, whereas ChronoMagic-Pro includes both types to increase diversity. If the 60s+ videos, which account for 27% of ChronoMagic-Pro, are excluded, the average length would be only 12.36 seconds.\\n\\n3.

We provide additional qualitative analysis, as shown in Figure 13. It is evident that, after fine-tuning, the generated videos can extend changes beyond mere lighting and camera movements to alterations in the state of objects, while ensuring that the visual quality, text relevance, and coherence remain uncompromised. This proves that ChronoMagic-Pro can support existing models in generating high-quality time-lapse videos with significant state changes, providing a new approach for future T2V model training.

This phenomenon has also been observed in MagicTime-DiT [89], despite utilizing only around 2,000 time-lapse videos. However, it is important to note that the Magic Training Strategy [89], originally designed for U-Net-based models, may not be as effective for DiT-based models. In this study, we employ this methods solely for verification experiments. Additionally, the efficacy of simple fine-tuning is inferior to that achieved through the Magic Training Strategy [89].\\n\\nD.4 More Qualitative Evaluation on ChronoMagic-Bench\\n\\nDue to space limitations, additional time-lapse videos generated by different baseline methods are shown in Figure 14. Similar to the results in the main text, most algorithms, except for MagicTime [89], fail to generate time-lapse videos with significant state changes, such as building construction. However, for time-lapse videos with smaller state changes, essentially faster-moving videos like city traffic changes, U-Net-based methods [73, 69, 30, 76, 23, 11, 89] exhibit much better visual quality, text relevance, and coherence compared to DiT-based methods [49, 43, 96].

The evaluation focused on four primary aspects: **Visual Quality**, **Text Relevance**, **Metamorphic Amplitude**, and **Coherence**. For each criterion, we employed a five-point rating scale and provided scoring guidelines to ensure consistent user selections, thereby minimizing assessment bias.

Conversely, ChronoMagic-Pro exclusively employs videos from YouTube (CC BY 4.0). The licensing types of these videos are clearly indicated on their respective platforms. The CC0 license (Creative Commons Zero) designates content as public domain, allowing unrestricted use without the need for additional permissions or licenses. Videos from the YouTube platform adhere to the CC BY 4.0 license (Creative Commons Attribution 4.0); consequently, we have included video IDs and author information in the metadata to prevent any potential contractual disputes. The video content consists entirely of time-lapse footage, and we detect and discard NSFW content based on the video caption. For videos involving identifiable individuals, we accelerate the blurring process to ensure the security of personally identifiable information. The collected videos are organized into four major categories (comprising 75 subcategories), with contributors hailing from various countries and regions worldwide. This diversity ensures that ChronoMagic-Bench and ChronoMagic-Pro possess ample representativeness. The Open-Sora-Plan model [43], fine-tuned using our dataset, exhibited no significant content bias.\\n\\nData collection was facilitated by the dedicated efforts of numerous contributors, including the authors of this paper and those who participated in the human evaluation. We regard an individual\u2019s hourly wage or compensation as personal information, which, due to privacy considerations, cannot be disclosed. Nonetheless, we can confirm that all participants received appropriate compensation in compliance with the legal requirements of their respective countries or regions. The privacy information of all participants is protected, so there is no additional risk to the them.\\n\\n**Societal Impact and Potential Harmful Consequences.** The objective of ChronoMagic-Bench is to identify the limitations of current text-to-video generation models in producing time-lapse videos and to develop the ChronoMagic-Pro dataset to advance the field. Although time-lapse video generation models offer substantial potential to support and enhance human creativity, it is crucial to consider broader societal implications during their development:\\n\\nFirst and foremost, environmental issues cannot be overlooked. As text-to-video generation technology advances, the demand for computational resources escalates. Large-scale data processing, model testing, and training generally depend on energy-intensive data centers, which significantly contribute to carbon emissions. For instance, this study utilized the energy-intensive H100 for experiments. If\"}"]}

Consequently, researchers and developers should focus on optimizing algorithms to reduce energy consumption.\\n\\nSecondly, the generation of false content has raised significant social and ethical concerns. After appropriate fine-tuning using the ChronoMagic-Pro/ProH dataset, text-to-video generation models are capable of producing not only metamorphic videos with extended time spans and high levels of realism but also high-quality general videos. These generative models could be misused to create deceptive videos, potentially misleading the public or disseminating misinformation, particularly on fast-paced and widely influential platforms such as social media. To prevent such misuse, it is crucial to consider the implementation of content authenticity verification mechanisms and the establishment of robust legal and ethical frameworks during the development and deployment of these technologies.\\n\\nLastly, the issue of dataset bias may result in skewed and inequitable outcomes in model generation. Although the video content in the ChronoMagic-Bench and ChronoMagic-Pro datasets is sourced globally, the captions are exclusively in English. This single-language choice may impair the model\u2019s ability to accurately interpret and generate videos across diverse cultural contexts and non-English language environments. Moreover, this bias could exacerbate existing language inequalities by disregarding the needs of non-English-speaking users. Therefore, future dataset construction should incorporate multilingual support to ensure broader adaptability and fairness in models on a global scale.\\n\\n**Impact Mitigation Measures.** We take full responsibility for the licensing, distribution, and maintenance of our ChronoMagic-Bench and ChronoMagic-Pro/ProH.
