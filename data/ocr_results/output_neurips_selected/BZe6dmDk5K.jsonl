Current action quality assessment (AQA) algorithms predominantly focus on actions from real specific scenarios and are pre-trained with normative action features, thus rendering them inapplicable in AIGVs. To address these problems, we construct GAIA, a Generic AI-generated Action dataset, by conducting a large-scale subjective evaluation from a novel causal reasoning-based perspective, resulting in 971,244 ratings among 9,180 video-action pairs. Based on GAIA, we evaluate a suite of popular text-to-video (T2V) models on their ability to generate visually rational actions, revealing their pros and cons on different categories of actions. We also extend GAIA as a testbed to benchmark the AQA capacity of existing automatic evaluation methods. Results show that traditional AQA methods, action-related metrics in recent T2V benchmarks, and mainstream video quality methods perform poorly with an average SRCC of 0.454, 0.191, and 0.519, respectively, indicating a sizable gap between current models and human action perception patterns in AIGVs. Our findings underscore the significance of action quality as a unique perspective for studying AIGVs and can catalyze progress towards methods with enhanced capacities for AQA in AIGVs.\\n\\n1 Introduction\\n\\nAction quality assessment (AQA), which aims to quantify how well actions are performed, is a growing area of research across various domains (e.g., [77, 58, 76, 27, 96, 100]). It is becoming especially challenging since generative models like Sora [68, 73] have revolutionized the creation of visually realistic videos. Assessing how well an action is presented can be difficult because of the inherent difference between real videos and generated videos [21, 67]. At minimum, a well-performed action should correctly contain all relevant objects as well as the action subject with recognizable motion presentation while conforming to the physical world dynamics [39, 117]. Moreover, the exponential growth of text-to-video (T2V) models has also given rise to formidable challenges in the evaluation of video action quality, underscoring the increasing need for reliable solutions.\\n\\nHowever, there is a significant gap in the existing AQA research. First, prior work has contributed multiple AQA datasets, which predominantly focus on domain-specific actions from real videos and collect coarse-grained expert-only human ratings [77, 119, 76] on limited dimensions. Meanwhile, the content discrepancies in those AQA videos are often subtle, as the action subjects typically perform similar actions within a consistent environment. Examples include swimming and diving in a natatorium or gymnastics in a gym, which lacks consideration for scene diversity. Second, the\"}"]}

Nevertheless, a distinguishing characteristic of generated videos is that they may contain atypical actions with various body or object artifacts over time [23, 69], such as aberrant limb count, irrational object shape, and physically implausible motion, due to the stochasticity and unstable nature of the diffusion process. In such cases, the model learned from real action videos may fail in AIGVs with worse prediction performance. At present, it remains unclear to what degree any T2V model can achieve visually rational action generation that varies in action categories, much less the cognitive mechanism of action quality that affects human perception.\\n\\nTo address these issues, we present **GAIA**, a **Generic AI-generated Action** dataset encompassing 9,180 AI-generated videos from 18 T2V models, spanning both lab studies and commercial platforms, which covers a variety of whole-body, hand, and facial actions. Specifically, we recruit 54 participants and conduct a large-scale human evaluation to evaluate the action quality *first-of-this-kind* from three causal reasoning-based perspectives: subject quality, action completeness, and action-scene interaction. Among them, as the major premise of an action, the quality of the action subject directly affects the whole action process. Assessing action completeness ensures that the generated action is not only temporally coherent but also logically and narratively complete. Action-scene interaction considers the spatial relationships, environmental factors, and interactions with other elements within the scene that can influence the perception of the action\u2019s quality and realism. Crucially, it provides quantifiable action state estimations based on the behavior of human reasoning in perceiving an action. In theory, this makes complicated coupled action quality approachable and tractable. In practice, the full potential of multi-dimension methods remains largely untapped due to a scarcity of existing datasets, exacerbated by the difficulty of obtaining reliable group subjective opinions. This complements earlier research, which primarily concentrated on AQA under a single real scenario and lacked rating granularity.\\n\\nWe prove the value and type of insights GAIA enables by using it to evaluate the action generation ability and weaknesses across different categories of 18 representative T2V models (several times more than existing benchmarks [23, 51, 69, 67]). Moreover, we contribute a holistic benchmark based on GAIA, which reveals that the existing AQA methods and action-related automatic metrics even video quality assessment (VQA) approaches, correlate poorly with human evaluation. Overall, our study could serve as a pilot for future endeavors aimed at developing accurate AQA methods in generative scenarios while providing substantial insights for better defining the quality of AIGVs.\"}"]}

Early works [80, 105] solely consider human pose-based features while neglecting the relations among joints and other action quality-related visual cues (e.g. splash in diving or barbell position in weightlifting). Later, researchers introduced graph structure to model the joint motion information spatially and temporally [75, 11, 30, 122]. In another line, vision-based approaches [79, 114, 115, 122, 124, 27] combined 3D convolutional neural networks (C3D) [101] with context-aware modules to extract motion-oriented spatial-temporal visual features for assessing action quality. As shown in Tab. 1, there are numerous datasets for AQA, which predominantly focus on the sports domain from real scenarios, while the problem of considering action quality in AI-generated videos remains unexplored. Furthermore, human activities often occur in specific scene contexts, e.g., swimming in a swimming pool. However, it is also possible to enjoy champagne in the pool. Training an action quality assessment model for more diverse AI-generated actions using existing video datasets thus inevitably introduces such bias, which may opposed to paying attention to the actual action in the scene. Choi et al. [24] proposed to mitigate scene bias by adding an adversarial loss for scene types and masking out the human actors. Similar operations include extracting the foreground and background parts of the video as data augmented pairs to improve the accuracy of action recognition [38]. Apart from pixel space augmentation, Gorpincenko et al. [37] extended it further to utilize the time domain to perform deeper levels of temporal perturbations, thus improving the robustness of action classifiers. The above studies illustrate the necessity of disentangling action process from scenes or decomposing the action process to mitigate the effect of representation bias.\\n\\nFrom the perspective of data provenance, virtual worlds and game engines are plausible techniques to generate editable actions as synthetic data before the Generative AI Era. Such synthetic data has been used to train visual models for lots of computer vision tasks (e.g., object detection, recognition, pose estimation, and scene understanding) to extract visual priors. Desouza et al. [82] proposed a diverse, realistic, and physically plausible dataset of human action videos using virtual world simulation software. Experiments show that mixing both synthetic and real samples at the mini-batch level during training can significantly improve action recognition accuracy. Similarly, the controllability of both the type and quality of AI-generated actions (using different types of prompts and video generation models) offers a feasible solution for constructing large-scale action quality assessment datasets, especially for those irrational scenarios.\\n\\n**Video Generative Models.** The recent breakthroughs of generative models [28, 83] expedites massive works towards video generation [49, 53, 110, 15, 120, 71, 41, 109, 43]. As a pioneer, VDM [48] extended the standard image diffusion architecture and presented a 3D U-Net structure [84] to jointly learn the spatial and temporal generation knowledge. Its subsequent works such as Imagen video [46], LaVie [110], and Show-1 [120] cascaded VDM to perform text-conditional video generation and spatial-temporal super-resolution in sequence. AnimateDiff [41] built a flexible MotionLoRA to learn transferable motion priors that can be integrated into text-to-image (T2I) models for video generation. Parallelly, VideoPoet [55] incorporated a mixture of multimodal generative objectives via an autoregressive transformer so as to handle various video generation tasks. More recently, a multi-agent based video generation framework, Mora [118] has been proposed that combines several\"}"]}

In addition to the above laboratory studies, several derived commercial video generation products, e.g., Gen-2 [1], Genmo [2], Pika [6], Neverends [5], MoonValley [3], Morph [4], Stable Video [7], and Sora [73, 68], have harvested widespread attention from both academia and industry, exhibiting great possibilities for future AI-assisted video creation.\\n\\n**Evaluations on Video Generative Models.** Early video generation models shared the same frame-wise evaluation metrics as T2I models, such as Inception Score (IS) [87], Fr\u00e9chet Inception Distance (FID) [45], and CLIPScore [81], as well as their variants for video [103, 104, 86]. These metrics are all group-targeted and not suitable for assessing a single video. For text-to-video (T2V) models, several benchmarks [23, 67, 51, 69, 57] have been proposed to assess various perspectives like video fidelity [57], temporal quality [67], text-video alignment [51, 69]. Despite covering various dimensions, these works lack specificity and breadth with limited model exploration and human group annotation. Our work differs from current research in three key aspects: 1) We created 510 distinct action prompts covering both coarse-grained and fine-grained actions, each applied with 18 T2V models for extensive assessment. 2) Our casual reasoning-based and multi-dimensional action quality evaluation offers valuable and comprehensive insights into video generation. 3) We have quantitatively validated a large amount of existing metrics that none of them performs well on the AI-generated action quality assessment task.\\n\\n### 3 Dataset Acquisition\\n\\n**Prompt Sources.** The marvelous interrelation and working mechanism of body, hand, and face have a high degree of inner unity, which together constitute the key elements of actions [31]. Hence, we sampled action keywords for GAIA from a variety of sources, including the Kinetics-400 [14] for whole-body actions, the EgoGesture dataset [123] and the valence-arousal model of affect [85] for fine-grained local hand and facial actions, respectively (Fig. 1(b)). Besides, to avoid linguistic bias and ensure each action keyword appears explicitly in the prompt, we leverage the GPT-4 [9] to design an assembled prompt strategy (Fig. 1(a)). It consists of a common head, an action-oriented description, and an output control, where we intentionally leave out specialized suffixes such as 8k, HDR, photographic, and high fidelity for fairness. In the meantime, an expert review of the generated prompts is organized to examine the hallucination problem of large language model (LLM) while avoiding NSFW issues for ethical concerns. At last, we obtain 510 prompts for all action categories with an average length of 8.25 words.\"}"]}

To evaluate the action quality of AI-generated videos thoroughly, we select 18 representative T2V models for generation including: 1) 11 open-sourced lab studies: Text2Video-Zero [53], ModelScope [106], ZeroScope [8], LaVie [110], Show-1 [120], Hotshot-XL [71], AnimateDiff [41], VideoCrafter1 (resolution at 512\u00d7320 and 1024\u00d7576) [15], VideoCrafter2 [16], and Mora [118]; 2) 7 popular commercial creation applications: Gen-2 [1], Genmo [2], Pika [6], NeverEnds [5], MoonValley [3], Morph Studio [4], and Stable Video [7], shown in Tab. 2. Note that CogVideo [49] and Gen-1 [32] are excluded due to the language and mode restrictions. Since we focus on human-centric actions in this paper, other settings such as camera motions or styles are set by template. At last, 9,180 videos were collected. We defer more details to the Appendix (Sec. B.1).\\n\\n3.2 Task Definition: the Action Syllogism\\n\\nConsidering the peculiar characteristics of AI-generated videos, to collect a more explainable and nuanced understanding of public perception on action assessment, instead of collecting professional skill scores as in existing AQA studies [76, 115], we opt to collect annotations from a novel perspective, namely the causal reasoning syllogism [93, 54]. Specifically, we decompose an action process into three parts: 1) action subject as major premise, 2) action completeness as minor premise, and 3) interaction between action and scenes as conclusion, according to the syllogism theory. The rationale for this strategy is as follows: (a) The visibility of the action in videos is greatly affected by the rendering quality of the action subject, which is a crucial element of visual saliency information, while humans excel at perceiving such generated artifacts [21, 51, 70]. (b) Moreover, unlike parallel-form feedbacks, the order of these three parts in action syllogism inherently aligns with the human reasoning process. For instance, while human annotators are shown with an action scene about \u201cA musician is playing the piano\u201d, they can intuitively reason like: \u2776 a musician as the major premise, which is the subject to execute the action of playing the piano; \u2777 appearance or completeness of action as the minor premise, containing the spatial and temporal boundaries in the given scenario; \u2778 phenomenon of the keys being pressed as the conclusion describing a reasonable result considering both constraints. This reasoning-form evaluation has many merits. First, by breaking down an action into its constituent parts, researchers can more clearly identify and analyze the specific elements that contribute to the perceived quality of the action. Second, such causal reasoning-based strategy is inherently aligned with human perception and can help in understanding how different parts of action are perceived by the public, which can lead to insights into what makes AI-generated action convincing or unconvincing. Third, this scheme allows for a comparative analysis of AI-generated action against natural human action, revealing where AI excels and where it may need improvement.\\n\\n3.3 Subjective Action Quality Assessment\\n\\nParticipants and Apparatus. To ensure the comprehensiveness, fairness, and reliability of the evaluation, we recruit a total of 54 participants to participate in our human evaluation, as shown in Tab. 3. All with normal (corrected) eyesight. Considering the viewing effect, a 27-inch Lenovo monitor with a resolution of 2560\u00d71440 is used for video display. The viewing distance and optimal horizontal viewing angle are set as 1.9 times the height of the display (\u2248 70cm) and [31\u00b0, 58\u00b0], respectively. Before the annotation, we instructed all participants to have a clear and consistent understanding of all evaluated aspects and tested their eligibility via a 30-video pre-labeling [20]. In the tutorial for each dimension, participants are guided to rate 10 generated-real video pairs with the same caption. Their answer is compared with ground-truth ratings that were developed by multiple experts. Raters needed to achieve at least 75% ratings that satisfied |ground_truth \u2212 rating| < 1.5\u03c3_{expert} to move on to the formal study.\\n\\nMain Process. We adopted a single-stimulus methodology in this evaluation and asked participants to focus on the given action keyword as well as the corresponding prompt and evaluate three action-related dimensions of AI-generated videos, i.e., subject quality, action completeness, and action-scene interaction, by dragging the slide button at a [0, 100] continuous rating scale. We randomly divided the 9,180 videos in GAIA into 31 sessions, with each session, except the last, comprising 300 videos. Ten golden videos with expert opinions from the real-world action database [14] were added to each session as an inspection to control the scoring deviations.

To reduce visual fatigue, there is a rest segment with at least 15 minutes per 150 videos [90, 21, 19]. In summary, it took participants approximately 2.6 hours to finish one session, and all experiments took over a month to complete. Each participant was compensated $12 for each session according to the current ethical standard [92].\\n\\n**Quality Control.** In addition to the above pre-labeling and in-process check trial, we noticed 5 line clickers (all male) with over 40% of the same ratings. We removed all their ratings from GAIA dataset. Besides, we follow Otani et al.\u2019s [74] recommendation that uses the inter-annotator agreement (IAA) metric (Krippendorff\u2019s $\\\\alpha$ [42]) to assess the quality of ratings, where Krippendorff\u2019s $\\\\alpha$ for subject quality, action completeness, and action-scene interaction perspectives are 0.6771, 0.6243, and 0.6311, respectively, indicating appropriate variations among annotators. We further calculated the SRCC score using bootstrapping as in KonIQ-10k [50]. Fig. 2 shows the mean agreement (Spearman rank-order correlation coefficient, SRCC) between the MOS values as the number of observers grows. When considering the correlation between nearly 70% of the participants in our study, the mean SRCC reaches remarkably high values of 0.9556, 0.9531, and 0.9627 in terms of subject quality, action completeness, and action-scene interaction, respectively, which provides a reasonable reference population size for subsequent subjective AQA studies. At last, we obtained a total of 971,244 reliable ratings with an average of 105.8 ratings per video (35.27 per dimension). We then perform Z-score normalization to the raw MOS of each subject to avoid inter-annotator scoring biases. Here, we abbreviate the MOS of three perspectives as $MOS_s$, $MOS_c$, and $MOS_i$ according to their initials for simplicity. A higher value indicates superior performance or quality in that particular aspect.\\n\\n### 3.4 Dataset Statistics and Analysis\\n\\n**Overall Observations.** Each data sample in GAIA consists of four elements: the action keyword $k$, the corresponding prompt $t$, the generated video $v$, and the action quality-related human annotations $\\\\{MOS_a\\\\}_{a \\\\in A}$. $A$ is the collection of three perspectives. Fig. 4 illustrates two examples of generated videos with small (shaking hands) and large (riding bike) movements. In Fig. 1(c), we visualize the 3D scatter map of human-annotated subject quality, action completeness, and action-scene interaction scores in the GAIA dataset and examine three extreme cases, where two dimensions are most differently or consistently (noted in purple circles). In general, the generated videos receive lower-than-average human ratings ($\\\\mu_s = 35.48$, $\\\\mu_c = 33.81$, $\\\\mu_i = 30.25$) on three perspectives, suggesting the inferior performance of existing models to produce artifact-free videos with coherent actions. From Tab. 4, we notice a significantly higher correlation between $MOS_c$ and $MOS_i$ ($0.931$ Spearman\u2019s $\\\\rho$, $0.791$ Kendall\u2019s $\\\\tau$) than other pairs, indicating that\\n\\n![Figure 3: MOS distributions across different models in terms of subject quality, action completeness, and action-scene interaction. 11 Lab studies: (a)-(k); 7 Commercial applications: (l)-(r).](image)\\n\\n![Figure 2: SRCC between MOSs as the observers increases.](image)\\n\\n| Metric       | $MOS_s \\\\rightarrow MOS_c$ | $MOS_s \\\\rightarrow MOS_i$ | $MOS_c \\\\rightarrow MOS_i$ |\\n|--------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|\\n| Spearman\u2019s $\\\\rho$ | 0.863                       | 0.866                       | 0.931                       |\\n| Kendall\u2019s $\\\\tau$  | 0.704                       | 0.703                       | 0.791                       |\\n\\n**Table 4: Effects of perspectives.** The correlation between different perspectives for all 9,180 videos in GAIA.\"}"]}

Most models exhibit left-skewed MOS distribution in all three dimensions. Among them, VideoCrafter2 [16] and Morph Studio [4] are basically the best models in their respective fields (see Fig. 13 in the Appendix for detailed ranking in all dimensions). Additionally, we can observe a trend of increasing performance year by year, from the Text2Video-zero [53] and ModelScope [106] released in March 2023 to the VideoCrafter2 [16] in early 2024. Nevertheless, most models prove decent proficiency on one single dimension, *i.e.*, better subject quality than action completeness and action-scene interaction, which exposes the defects of existing models in producing temporal coherent and complete actions. Surprisingly, the newly proposed Mora [118] significantly underperforms other models in all three perspectives, we speculate that it is limited by the core dependency model in its demo code, stable video diffusion (SVD), an earlier image-to-video model. Furthermore, comparing the two resolution versions of VideoCrafter1 (512 \u00d7 320 and 1024 \u00d7 576) [15], as well as the commercial models and the lab studies (with an average resolution of 596 \u00d7 378 and 1385 \u00d7 835), we can conclude that higher resolution plays an important role in improving action recognizability, resulting in advancements in\"}"]}

A similar conclusion applies to the performance gains as the frame rate increases.\\n\\n**Class-wise Comparison.** We investigate the MOS distribution across action categories via box plots, as presented in Fig. 5. It can be observed that the MOSs, MOSc, and MOSi of complex actions such as *jumping/throwing* and *racquet-bat* are lower than actions with small movements (*e.g.*, *communication*, *touching person*, and *using tools*) (*p* < 0.01, Two-side T-test), indicating that existing T2V models struggle to render actions with drastic motion changes, where atypical body postures are more easily involved. Additionally, when it comes to the local hand action categories, the actions contain subtle movements, *e.g.*, *rotate or move fingers/palm*, or *numeral representation* receive significantly lower MOSs than others, showing the inferior capacity of generating fine-grained actions. Specifically, the frequency of outliers in Fig. 5 reflects the response variance of evaluated models under specific action word conditions, which further supports the above viewpoints. *Beyond the above observations, we further analyze the diversity of contents in GAIA (see Sec.

We also select six action-related metrics from recent T2V benchmarks (VBench [51] and EvalCrafter [67]) as comparisons. Additionally, we include seven representative VQA methods (TLVQM [56], VIDEVAL [102], VSFA [60], BVQA [59], SimpleVQA [97], FAST-VQA [112], and DOVER [113]) to reveal the potential relation between action quality and video quality. We further investigate the performance of video-text alignment metrics, since a high-quality action should be consistent with its target prompt. Seven metrics including four variants of CLIPScore [44] and three vision-language model (VLM)-based metrics, which replace CLIP with more advanced VLMs (BLIP [61], LLaVA-v1.5-7B [65], and InternLM-XComposer2-VL [29]) are evaluated. SRCC and PLCC are adopted as criteria to evaluate the performance of these models. *More implementation details can be found in Sec.

Benefiting from the dynamic-static hybrid stream, ACTION-NET can capture the body postures at specific moments during an action process and thus performs marginally better than the rest models in terms of subject quality. For CoRe and TSA, the input requirement is a pairwise query and exemplary video, which is not exactly applicable to AIGVs, since the same action from different models can vary significantly from generation quality to content scenarios, failing the contrastive regression strategy [119, 115]. Most importantly, plagued by the generation quality of AIGV itself, it is difficult for those commonly used inflated 3D ConvNets (I3D) backbone to learn normative action features as in Kinetics [14]. In general, existing AQA methods focus mainly on assessing actions in a similar environment, where the differences between videos are subtle, which is in accord with its goal (*most for specific tasks rather than a generic AQA*).\\n\\n**Which action-related metric performs better?** As reported in the second part of Tab. 5, all action-related metrics selected from existing benchmarks achieve extremely low correlation in the GAIA dataset with the best scores of 0.2453, 0.2895, and 0.2861 in subject quality, action completeness, and action-scene interaction. Among them, the \u201cHuman Action\u201d from VBench [51] and the \u201cAction-Score\u201d from EvalCrafter [67] adopt a similar approach that utilizes the action classification accuracy to quantify the action quality. Their incapability can be attributed to 1) the used recognition model, VideoMAE V2 [107] and UMT [62], are pre-trained only on Kinetics 400 action classes [52] while our GAIA encompasses much broader action types; 2) based on the premise that action subject is clearly visible and temporally consistent, a condition that is challenging to fulfill in the majority of existing AIGVs. Using optical flow-based metrics, \u201cDynamic Degree\u201d and \u201cFlow-Score\u201d, to measure the movement of actions fails since the motion amplitude of different actions varies. \u201cMotion Smoothness\u201d is proposed to evaluate whether the motion in AIGVs follows the physical law of the real world based on the frame interpolation theory [51]. However, it is not conducive to videos with a low frame rate and cannot justify the rationality of the generated action result such as *badminton ball flying against gravity*. As for the \u201cSubjective Consistency\u201d metric, there is a potential for misapplication in assessing the quality of the subject, since variability in subject posture throughout the action can easily lead to inter-frame subject inconsistencies. Consolidating the above experimental results, we can conclude that current action evaluation metrics fall short of providing reliable action assessments, necessitating a concerted effort to address these issues for the emerging AIGVs.\\n\\n**Comparison to the VQA methods.** Considering the intrinsic correlation of action quality on the content quality of videos, we select seven representative VQA methods to validate whether VQA\"}"]}

We can observe that VQA methods surpass all AQA methods and action-related metrics by a large margin (on average 25.04% and 131.1% better than their respective best methods in terms of SRCC) in the subject quality dimension, while deep learning-based VQA methods perform better than traditional VQA methods (TLVQM and VIDEVAL) that rely on handcraft features. Notably, all VQA methods exhibit a relatively superior capacity to evaluate the subject quality than assessing the action completeness and action-scene interaction, indicating a potential emphasis on low-level technical distortions such as noises, sharpness, blur, and artifacts within the current VQA frameworks, which may not fully encapsulate the temporal-level normativity and interactive facets of action content. Such a conclusion is also supported by evidence from being equipped with different quality-aware initializations, as BVQA and DOVER are pre-trained with spatial distortion-dominated datasets [25, 36, 50, 33, 116]. Moreover, BVQA and SimpleVQA leverage the SlowFast model [34] as their motion feature extractor. This model has demonstrated effectiveness in various action recognition tasks due to its dual pathway design, which captures both spatial semantics and motion information parallelly. However, it encounters problems when applied to AIGVs, primarily because of the limited frames. Another plausible explanation for these subpar performances is the pure regression-based prediction strategy that lacks consideration of textual information, as the same MOS for different actions could lead to a large visual discrepancy.\\n\\n**Evaluation on video-text alignment metrics.** We further evaluate the performance of video-text alignment metrics in measuring action quality considering their capacity in cross-modality feature mapping. Specifically, we compute the cosine similarity between the image embedding and the action prompt embedding to record a deviation degree between the sketch of the content and target action semantics. As listed in Tab. 5, the widely used CLIPScore achieves a weak correlation with human opinion, especially in the subject quality dimension, while performing relatively better with respect to action completeness and action-scene interaction dimensions. We conjecture that this is because such alignment-based metrics are intrinsically sensitive to high-level vision information (*action semantics*) rather than low-level generative flaws (*e.g.*, blur, noise, textures). Meanwhile, we see a decent performance gain on evaluated dimensions (+8.2%, +9.6%, +10.9%, +13.1% in terms of SRCC) when replacing CLIP with a more powerful VLM, such as InternLM-XComposer2-VL, showing an underlying possibility of building more accurate AQA metrics as VLMs evolve. We also conduct a T-test with a 95% confidence level to assess the statistical significance of the performance difference between any two methods (Tab. 9 and Fig. 15). More results are discussed in Sec. D.\\n\\n## 5 Conclusion\\n\\nAssessing action quality in AI-generated videos is a critical topic since it is an intuitive manifestation of the model generation ability and an imperative factor influencing the viewing experience of a video that requires data beyond the currently available prompt and video pairs datasets. We present GAIA, a well-curated generic AI-generated action dataset comprising 9,180 videos generated from 18 popular T2V models with 971,244 human annotations collected. We use it to evaluate the action generation ability of existing T2V models and benchmark the performance of current AQA and VQA methods. Our analysis characterizes the distinctness, variation, and capacity evolution of existing T2V models while revealing the inferiority of traditional AQA and VQA algorithms in providing subjectively consistent action quality assessments for AI-generated videos. We hope that GAIA will facilitate the development of accurate AQA algorithms for AIGVs while elucidating the factors to which humans are sensitive during action perception.\\n\\n**Limitations and Societal Impact.** First, the videos in our dataset are limited in scope concerning subject types and styles, which constrains its applicability. The current synthetic actions are relatively simple as opposed to the complicated motions in real life. Second, videos in our dataset are generated with limited resolutions, frame rates, or lengths due to the imbalance between industry and academia, which could be further refined as the T2V model evolves. Third, different from prior work [78, 119, 66, 76, 115, 122], the action annotations in our dataset were collected based on a causal reasoning syllogism, which stands in stark contrast to the conventional practice of collecting a single quality score. Investigations of such a strategy on AQA would be a fruitful avenue for follow-up work. We anticipate that this work will lead to improved action quality in AI-generated videos, promoting the development of objective AQA metrics in generation domains and the understanding of human action perception mechanisms. Besides, this can make models pre-trained on this dataset less biased in assessing incomplete actions and irrational actions that easily appear in AI-generated scenarios.\"}"]}

We anticipate that this work will raise consideration of human perception and understanding in AI-generated actions to better understand generative models and enable more predictable behavior. Currently, the human preference and perceptual sensitivity to the quality of action along the whole action process still remains as an open problem. This work also provides significant guidance on how to optimize video generation models to produce videos with more pleasant actions. Meanwhile, we acknowledge that this study could raise some safety and ethical concerns. One challenging aspect of text-to-video models is the generation of NSFW content (such as violent and pornographic contents), which may be offensive or inappropriate for some viewers and can potentially foster illegal transactions. Although some video generation platforms like MoonValley, Morph and Stable Video have built-in safety filters that detect prompts with NSFW contents, they can still be circumvented through prompt engineering [18]. Additionally, AI video generation technology can be exploited by criminals for fake impersonations and identity theft. Our study also highlighted that some AI-generated videos can convincingly mimic individual\u2019s facial expressions and actions, thereby posing a latent threat to public safety and eroding public trust in social media.\"}"]}
{"id": "BZe6dmDk5K", "page_num": 21, "content": ["{\"primary_language\":\"en\",\"is_rotation_valid\":true,\"rotation_correction\":0,\"is_table\":false,\"is_diagram\":false,\"natural_text\":\"We further discuss how our work can be applied to benefit the community. Firstly, the main motivation of our work is that the action-related contents highly affect the video viewing experience, especially in this era where AI-generated models are prevalent, yet current video generation models inevitably suffer from subpar action quality, visual artifacts, and temporal inconsistencies within the generated actions. The existing action quality assessment (AQA) research is highly domain-specific, leading to a relatively poor generalization ability across tasks. Due to the domain gap between real videos and AI-generated videos (AIGVs) as well as the difference in task orientation, previous AQA methods underperform in AI generation scenarios. In terms of data sources, existing AQA studies collect the quality scores directly from judges or minority groups (Tab. 1), which is applicable in professional events but can introduce bias in studying the group preference. The mechanisms by which humans assess the quality of actions and the underlying influences are unknown. In this work, we find that the actions from mainstream T2V models are still subpar in subject quality, action completeness, and action-scene interaction perspectives (even Sora [73] shown in Fig. 7), while neither existing AQA algorithms nor video quality assessment (VQA) methods are suitable for evaluating action quality in AIGVs. Our findings underline the necessity of developing reliable automatic AQA metrics for AIGVs while taking the first step to evaluate the action quality in AIGVs through a causal reasoning manner, which also provides valuable insights for the community in refining video generation models. Secondly, despite the action quality, a common line of works tries to evaluate AI-generated videos from traditional spatial quality (e.g., fidelity, blur, brightness, and aesthetic) and temporal quality (e.g., light change, background consistency, warping error, and motion quality) perspectives [51, 23, 69, 67, 57]. Tab. 6 gives a brief comparison of existing T2V benchmarks. While these lines of work serve a general purpose, their action-related metrics were simply adapted from previous action representation strategies used in real world, which is less effective and exhibits inconsistency with human perception in AI-generated scenarios. Our work helps to build a more reasonable definition of action quality in AIGVs. Thirdly, evaluating action quality in a causal reasoning way offers a promising way to understand human action perception and test the performance of T2V models, thus pointing the path for the future improvement of video generation models.\\n\\nA.2 Ethical Discussions of Data Collection\\n\\nWe detail the ethical concerns that might arise in the dataset collection. All participants in subjective evaluation are clearly informed of the contents in our experiments. Specifically, we addressed the ethical challenges by obtaining from each subject depicted in the dataset a signed and informed agreement that they agreed their subjective ratings to be used for non-commercial research, making it equipped with such legal and ethical characteristics. The experiments do not contain any visually inappropriate content or NSFW content (both textual and visual) since we applied rigorous manual review during the action generation stage. Considering the large number of evaluated videos, we divided 9,180 videos into 31 sessions. Fig. 8 exhibits the user interface for collecting subjective opinions. Each participant was compensated $12 for each session according to the current ethical standard [92, 74]. It took over a month to complete the whole experiment, where each participant contributed an average of 80.6 hours to attend this experiment. To ensure participants\u2019 anonymity, we numbered 54 participants according to the order of participation into $P_1 \\\\ldots P_{54}$ and performed a questionnaire survey about their sex, age, and whether they had used AI generation tools, which are not considered as person identifiable information. Note that we do not disclose this information in our dataset, which is used only for reporting participants\u2019 statistics. The GAIA dataset is released under the CC BY 4.0 license, which includes all associated AIGVs and their corresponding action prompts.\\n\\nB More Details of GAIA Dataset\\n\\nWe listed the URL of the adopted text-to-video models in Tab. 7 and detailed the category of each action keyword in our GAIA dataset in Tab. 12, Tab. 13, Tab. 14, and Tab. 15.\\n\\nB.1 Detailed Information of Text-to-Video Models\\n\\nText2Video-Zero.

As a way of characterizing the content diversity of the videos in each dataset, we calculate six low-level features including brightness, contrast, colorfulness, sharpness, spatial information (SI), and temporal information (TI) [102], thereby providing a large visual space in which to plot and analyze content diversities of the five AQA datasets. To reasonably reduce the computational overhead, each of these features was computed on every 8th frame, then averaged over frames to obtain an overall feature representation of each content. Here, we denote the feature as $\\\\{F_i\\\\}, i = 1, 2, \\\\ldots, 6$. Fig. 10 shows the fitted kernel distribution of each selected feature. We also plotted convex hulls of paired features in Fig. 11 to show the feature coverage of each dataset. Furthermore, to quantify the coverage and uniformity of these datasets over each feature space, we computed the relative range and uniformity of coverage [111]. Concretely, the relative range is given by:\\n\\n$$R^k_i = \\\\frac{\\\\max(D^k_i) - \\\\min(D^k_i)}{\\\\max_k(D^k_i)},$$\\n\\nwhere $D^k_i$ denotes the feature distribution of dataset $k$ for a given feature dimension $i$. $\\\\max_k(D^k_i)$ specifies the maximum value for that given dimension across all datasets. The entropy of the B-bin histogram of $D^k_i$ over all sources for each dataset $k$ is calculated to quantify the uniformity of coverage, which stands for how uniformly distributed the videos are in each feature dimension:\\n\\n$$U^k_i = -\\\\sum_{b=1}^{B} p_b \\\\log_B p_b,$$\\n\\nwhere $p_b$ denotes the normalized number of contents in bin $b$ at feature $i$ for dataset $k$.

First, there is a relatively linear distribution of STD for all three perspectives with MOS<15, suggesting that humans are more consistent in perceiving poor-quality actions. Similar observations can be found in high MOS scenarios (MOS>90). Second, the trend lines reveal a peak in STD distribution when MOS is in [20, 40], with a steeper decline and increase in the high MOS range (MOS>80) and low MOS range (MOS<30), respectively. We speculate that AI-generated high-quality actions are mostly consistent with people\u2019s common sense, whereas medium- and low-quality actions exhibit greater diversity, leading to a more pronounced divergence among individuals. Another plausible explanation is that this is due to the uneven distribution of high and low quality action videos in GAIA. Third, the STD distribution is narrower for the subject quality dimension than for action completeness and action-scene interaction dimensions, indicating that the perception of spatial quality distortion in action is less divergent than the temporal consistency and rationality distortion.\\n\\nC Implementation Details\\n\\nOur experiments were conducted on a computer with Intel Core i9-14900K CPU@3.20GHz, 64GB RAM, and NVIDIA RTX 4090 24GB.

Although CLIP is not tuned for fine-grained actions, it may work for some coarse-grained actions, as the action itself is also related to the context of scene. We thereby conduct extra experiments to evaluate CLIPScore on three subsets of the GAIA dataset from coarse-grained actions (whole-body) to fine-grained actions (hand and facial). The results are shown in Tab. 10. We can observe that CLIPScore performs significantly worse on the facial subset (an average SRCC of 0.184, 0.194, and 0.239 in terms of subject quality, action completeness, and action-scene interaction, respectively) than the whole-body (an average SRCC of 0.345, 0.381, and 0.378) and hand subsets. The results further demonstrate the above conjecture that CLIPScore is not appropriate for the assessment of fine-grained actions such as facial actions. Moreover, CLIPScore performs relatively better in action completeness than the subject quality perspective. As discussed in the main paper (Sec. 4.2), we conjecture that such alignment-based metrics are intrinsically sensitive to global high-level vision information (action-related semantics) rather than low-level generative flaws (e.g., blur, noise, textures) that can severely affect the subject quality.\\n\\n**Whether the Combination of Different Metrics can Improve the Perceptual Consistency of Action Quality?** We test several different combinations of existing metrics for comparison. As shown in Tab. 11, in most cases, the performance of the combined one is within the best performance of a single one. Surprisingly, we found a performance gain when combining different variants of CLIPScore. We hypothesize that this is due to the spatial feature compensation provided by the different convolutional kernel sizes. Moreover, we observe that combining VSFA with \u201cHuman Action\u201d or \u201cFlow-Score\u201d did not yield performance improvements, rather, it resulted in a decrease in SRCC/PLCC scores. We attributed it to different scales of predicted scores, since Flow-Score is an optical flow-based metric. Adding VSFA with three variants of CLIPScore shows better SRCC/PLCC on all three perspectives compared to their single forms. As mentioned in the main paper, VQA methods perform better on subject quality than action completeness and action-scene interaction.\"}"]}

Therefore, combining these two kinds of metrics could effectively improve the subjective consistency of results. This observation provides intuition for the future development of better AQA methods. Additionally, CLIPScore and its variants outperform the other methods under zero-shot settings. This result suggests that considering both spatial and textual features to better associate visual features with scene descriptions is helpful in predicting action quality.\\n\\nIndeed, applying a combination of multiple methods is less efficient in practical applications. In the future, we will explore the structure of different models and investigate the possibility of fusing them at the module level in an end-to-end way to better predict the action quality.\"}"]}
