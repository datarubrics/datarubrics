Considering the diversity of sign languages across geographical regions, developing region-specific ISLR datasets is crucial for supporting communication and research. Auslan, as a sign language specific to Australia, still lacks a dedicated large-scale word-level dataset for the ISLR task. To fill this gap, we curate the first large-scale Multi-view Multi-modal Word-Level Australian Sign Language recognition dataset, dubbed MM-WLAuslan. Compared to other publicly available datasets, MM-WLAuslan exhibits three significant advantages: (1) the largest amount of data, (2) the most extensive vocabulary, and (3) the most diverse of multi-modal camera views. Specifically, we record 282K+ sign videos covering 3,215 commonly used Auslan glosses presented by 73 signers in a studio environment. Moreover, our filming system includes two different types of cameras, i.e., three Kinect-V2 cameras and a RealSense camera. We position cameras hemispherically around the front half of the model and simultaneously record videos using all four cameras. Furthermore, we benchmark results with state-of-the-art methods for various multi-modal ISLR settings on MM-WLAuslan, including multi-view, cross-camera, and cross-view. Experiment results indicate that MM-WLAuslan is a challenging ISLR dataset, and we hope this dataset will contribute to the development of Auslan and the advancement of sign languages worldwide. All datasets and benchmarks are available at MM-WLAuslan.\\n\\n* Work done while visiting the University of Queensland.\\n\u2020 Corresponding author.\"}"]}

Each sign language possesses its own vocabulary and grammatical rules, akin to spoken languages [1][2][3]. Notably, even within regions that share a commonly spoken language, such as the United States, Australia, and the United Kingdom, distinct native sign languages are prevalent. To facilitate communication between the deaf and hearing communities, Isolated Sign Language Recognition (ISLR) is highlighted as a fundamental sign language understanding task. ISLR aims to recognize an individual sign gloss, which is a written representation of signs using words from a spoken language, into a corresponding word or phrase in spoken languages [4][5].\\n\\nWith emerging deep learning techniques [6][7][8][9] and large-scale sign language datasets [4][10][11][12][13], ISLR achieves promising progress recently [14][4][15]. As shown in Table 1, researchers from various countries construct word-level sign language datasets and thus promote the development of ISLR in the respective sign languages, such as American Sign Language (ASL) [4][16][17][18][19][10], British Sign Language (BSL) [20][21], Chinese Sign Language (CSL) [22][23] and German Sign Language (DGS) [12][24]. Meanwhile, according to the Australian Federal Department of Health and Aged Care (DHAC) as of 14 May 2024, one in six Australians, over 3.6 million people, had hearing loss affecting them, and the number is expected to reach 7.8 million people by 2060. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no publicly available large-scale Auslan dataset for ISLR. Due to the regional nature of sign languages and the societal commitment to supporting individuals with hearing impairments, word-level Australian Sign Language (Auslan) datasets are inevitably and urgently needed in order to investigate automatic recognition.\\n\\nMoreover, the volume of data, the breadth of data categories, and the diversity of data modalities are three critical points that influence the fundamental quality of an ISLR dataset. The larger the volume, the wider the range of categories, and the richer the modalities of data mean the higher the value of the dataset for scientific research and practical applications, such as sign language education [25] and dictionary [26]. Specifically, a large volume of data and an extensive gloss dictionary within the dataset enhance the robustness and capability of the sign recognition system. Additionally, the captured multi-view sign data and depth information improve the accuracy of recognizing complex hand movements and reduce the issues caused by occlusion and single-view ambiguities. However, most existing publicly available ISLR corpora either contain the limited gloss videos and vocabulary [5][16][27][12][13][24][28] or are only captured in a single viewpoint without depth information [4][10][19][18][20].\\n\\nIn this work, we record the first word-level Auslan recognition dataset, named MM-WLAuslan, that contains the largest number of data samples, the most extensive vocabulary, and the most diverse multi-modal camera views compared to other publicly available datasets, as shown in Table 1. Specifically, we select 3,215 commonly used glosses that contain a sufficient variety of classes and training instances for a practical word-level Auslan recognition model. We collect the glosses from Auslan SignBank [29], the most authoritative Auslan dictionary in Australia. We ask Auslan experts to help select glosses that are widely used throughout Australia, including fingerspelling glosses such as \u201cTV\u201d and \u201cNEWS\u201d. The collected glosses correspond to over 7,900 English words or phrases, covering most of the vocabulary commonly used in daily life. We invite sign language experts, deaf individuals, and volunteers to participate in the recording process. After 2,500+ hours of preparation and recording, we capture over 282K+ high-quality isolated Auslan gloss videos with the assistance of 73 signers. Each video recording is supervised by at least one Auslan expert to ensure the precision of the sign language expression.\\n\\nTo record multi-view, multi-modal, and high-quality isolated Auslan gloss videos, we set up a recording studio equipped with a green screen backdrop. We position two different types of RGB-D cameras, i.e., three Kinect-V2 cameras and a RealSense camera, hemispherically around the front half of the model. As shown in Figure 1, we place the cameras to the left-front, front, and right-front of the subject and simultaneously record videos. Unlike the previous dataset [24] that only provides depth video from the front view, we record both RGB-D videos from every camera.\\n\\n---\\n\\n3 https://www.health.gov.au/topics/ear-health/about\\n4 Auslan SignBank: https://auslan.org.au/dictionary/\\n5 English words are signed letter by letter.\"}"]}

Concurrently, we split the test set into four distinct subsets to mimic the various scenarios in the real world. Videos in three subsets are designed to incorporate diverse backgrounds or potential temporal disturbances. After obtaining the realistic test sets, we utilize the collected multi-modal, multi-view, and multi-camera videos to benchmark various multi-modal ISLR settings. Extensive experiments demonstrate the limitations of current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods when these methods are applied across various cameras and views. This manifests the potential of MM-WLAuslan to advance the future research and development of ISLR systems. Overall, our major contributions are summarized as follows:\\n\\n- We construct the first word-level Australian ISLR dataset, dubbed MM-WLAuslan. MM-WLAuslan consists of the largest number of gloss videos and the most extensive vocabulary.\\n- We provide the most diverse multi-modal camera views and enable the investigation of a variety of multi-modal ISLR settings, including multi-view, cross-camera and cross-view.\\n- We establish a leaderboard and an evaluation benchmark to promote future Australian ISLR research and development of applications.\\n\\n2 Related Work\\n\\n2.1 Isolated Sign Language Recognition Datasets\\n\\nAs shown in Table 1, several datasets are developed to facilitate research and application development of ISLR. However, most datasets have limitations in gloss dictionary size, depth information, and recording perspectives. For example, Purdue RVL-SLLL dataset [16] exhibits methodological rigor in a laboratory setting, but its applicability for sign language recognition is limited because it only covers 39 signs. Furthermore, despite ASLLVD dataset [17] including a large lexicon of 3,000 glosses, it is limited by its single perspective and lack of depth information, crucial for capturing the three-dimensional motion of sign language. WLASL [4] and MS-ASL [10] datasets expand on the number of signs and signers but still restrict their recordings to single-view videos without depth, missing critical spatial dynamics essential for accurate sign interpretation. In contrast, datasets like CSL 500 [11] and DGS Kinect 40 [12] include depth information but cover only a small number of glosses, limiting their usefulness for extensive sign language applications.\\n\\nDifferent from all of the above datasets, the proposed MM-WLAuslan dataset is a comprehensive ISLR dataset. It encompasses 3,215 signs from 73 signers, with each sign captured from four distinct viewpoints along with depth information, significantly enhancing the diversity and utility of the dataset. Moreover, MM-WLAuslan is currently the largest sign language recognition dataset in Australia, with extensive lexicon and high-quality data.\"}"]}

Previous research can be categorized into three types based on the input modality: pixel-based, pose-based and multi-modal-based approaches.\\n\\n**Pixel-based ISLR:** Significant advances in CNN-based action recognition inspire the development of pixel-based ISLR models. Early efforts [36, 37, 38] utilize convolutional neural networks (CNN) to extract frame-wise features, which are then temporally encoded using recurrent neural networks to capture time-series information. Meanwhile, 3D CNNs, such as C3D model [39, 40, 41] and I3D model [6], are commonly used in ISLR [10, 4, 42, 19, 43, 44].\\n\\n**Pose-based ISLR:** Unlike RGB pixel-based methods, pose-based ISLR models are robust against background clutters, lighting conditions, and occlusions, while explicitly depicting human hand and limb movements [45, 46, 47, 48]. ST-GCN [47], the first to apply a spatio-temporal graph convolutional network for action recognition, encodes motions across the human kinetic chain. Subsequent studies utilize this spatio-temporal architecture, employing both graph convolutional networks [4, 49, 50, 51] and Transformers [52, 53, 54, 55] to embedding and analyze sign pose data.\\n\\n**Multi-modal-based ISLR:** Recent studies show that combining pose, depth, and RGB modalities significantly improves ISLR. Zuo et al. [14] use the S3D model to extract RGB and pose heatmap features, enhancing recognition on the WLASL [4] dataset. Moreover, Jiang et al. [15] integrate depth information into the model, enabling recognition results to exceed 99% on the AUTSL dataset [35].\\n\\n2.3 Multi-view and Multi-modal Action Recognition\\n\\nPrevious research [56] argues that Action Recognition (AR) methods can be applied on sign language recognition. To build an effective and robust real-world ISLR and AR system, initiating multi-view and multi-modal learning is essential [28]. Recent advancements in AR introduce various approaches for multi-view learning [57], including dictionary learning [58], neural networks with adjustable views [59], convolutional neural networks [60], and attention mechanisms [61]. Additionally, Zhu et al. [62] adopt vision transformer models as robust solutions for multi-view learning. Recent approaches [63, 64] develop robust view-invariant representations for downstream tasks, while DA-Net [65] merges view-specific and independent modules for effective prediction. A feature factorization approach in [66] and a cascaded residual autoencoder in [67] address challenges in RGB-D action recognition and incomplete view classification, respectively.\\n\\n3 Proposed MM-WLAuslan Dataset\\n\\nIn this section, we describe our recording setup and workflow, detail the data processing and augmentation, and provide statistics for the MM-WLAuslan dataset.\\n\\n3.1 Recording Setup and Workflow\\n\\nOur recording setup is located in a studio environment surrounded by a green screen. In the studio, we position Kinect-V2 cameras at the left-front, front, and right-front views, along with a centrally placed RealSense camera. Both Kinect-V2 and RealSense are capable of recording high-quality videos with depth information. In the Appendix, we compare the different parameters of these two types of cameras. Most importantly, the imaging principles of Kinect-V2 and RealSense cameras are different. The former employs time-of-flight technology to measure depth, while the latter utilizes stereo vision to capture depth information. Moreover, Kinect-V2 offers high resolution and excellent depth sensing, while RealSense provides a higher frame rate and portability. We record data using these two types of RGB-D cameras to investigate the cross-camera robustness of methods.\\n\\nWe recruit signers with diverse experience in Auslan, including Auslan experts, deaf individuals who use Auslan, and volunteers interested in sign language, to sign glosses. The involvement of Auslan experts and deaf individuals ensures the precision of a subset of the data, which is crucial for precise research and applications of sign language. The extensive participation of volunteers enhances the\\n\\n---\\n\\n6 Our dataset follows the copyright Creative Commons BY-NC-SA 4.0 license.

Moreover, we design an interactive interface for dataset recording and present the interface in the Appendix. We record videos of sign language imitated by volunteers. Each sign is supervised and checked by at least one expert to ensure the precision of the sign language expression.\\n\\n### 3.2 Data Processing and Augmentation\\n\\nAfter recording all the sign language videos, we notice that a significant portion of the footage consists of a green screen background. Therefore, we utilize the keypoints estimated by AlphaPose \\\\[68, 69, 70\\\\] to remove the background that is irrelevant to the sign language. We crop videos based on a fixed-size box that can cover every signer and align their eyes on the same horizontal level.\\n\\nTo evaluate the performance of ISLR systems under real-world scenarios, we provide a diverse test set with four distinct subsets, including studio (STU) set, in-the-wild (ITW) set, synthetic background (SYN) set, and temporal disturbance (TED) set. Each subset encompasses videos for all gloss vocabulary. The **STU set** includes consistent scene settings with the training set. In the **ITW set**, green screens are removed and replaced with dynamic or static backgrounds to simulate videos recorded in diverse environments, as shown in Figure 2. We utilize the Background Remover\\\\[8\\\\] to extract signers from videos and synthesize indoor and outdoor backgrounds in the **SYN set**. The **TED set** simulates potential recording time discrepancies in real-world scenarios by randomly adjusting video segments through removal or altering playback speed.\\n\\nOverall, each data sample in our dataset includes: (1) RGB-D videos captured by a Kinect-V2 camera or a RealSense camera; (2) intrinsic and extrinsic parameters for the captured camera; (3) pose sequences corresponding to the RGB video; (4) gloss identities; (5) spoken English words or phrases corresponding to the gloss and (6) signer identities. These various views and modalities of sign language video samples can be further investigated for different word-level Auslan ISLR settings.\\n\\n### 3.3 Data Statistics\\n\\nWe select 3,215 commonly used Auslan glosses, corresponding to over 7,900 English words or phrases. As illustrated in Figure 3(b), there are more than 2,000 glosses with multiple meanings, highlighting the contextual variability of sign language similar to natural languages. Additionally, these terms are finely categorized into 49 groups, including health, education, and others, as shown in Figure 3(d). The extensive vocabulary and semantic richness of MM-WLAuslan demonstrate its potential to advance sign language research and applications.\\n\\nAfter over 2,500 hours of recording, we capture 282,900 videos by 73 signers. Specifically, for 3,215 commonly used word-level Auslan glosses, we record every gloss 22 times utilizing 4 different cameras (3215\u00d720\u00d74). Unlike other datasets \\\\[4, 10\\\\], our dataset maintains a consistent number of videos per Auslan gloss, thereby establishing a uniform ISLR dataset.

Meanwhile, we include a broader range of ethnicities to enhance the inclusivity and representativeness of the dataset further. Thus, this composition ensures that the ISLR models developed from this dataset mitigate biases and offer equitable performance across the diverse Australian population.

We utilize publicly available ISLR models, such as KVNet [14], SPOTER [74], DSTA-SLR [50], STC-SLR [51], SAM-SLR [15] and NLA-SLR [14]. Meanwhile, we incorporate models that have demonstrated strong performance in action recognition, including I3D [6], SlowFast [9] and Timesformer [72]. As indicated by Table 3, pixel-based models perform well in controlled STU. This suggests that pixel models are effective in settings with minimal noise and well-defined conditions. Conversely, pose-based models are robust in challenging environments, like ITW and SYN, because they focus on structural rather than textural information. Furthermore, NLA-SLR [14] is the SOTA model for ISLR. It ensembles the high-performance KVNet-V and KVNet-K models for pixel and pose data, respectively. The model demonstrates high accuracy across all test subsets consistently.\\n\\n**Single-view RGB-D-based ISLR:** As shown in Table 4, the combination of pixel and depth data generally improves recognition accuracy on most methods, highlighting the benefits brought by depth data. However, the performance of the KVNet-V [14] model declines, indicating its insufficient processing of depth information alongside pixel data. In contrast, the UMDR [73] model, a SOTA model for RGB-D action recognition, leads to significant performance improvements across various test subsets. Additionally, pose-based models with 3D pose data as the input also show improved performance, further supporting the benefits of integrating depth information into pose-based models.\\n\\n**Multi-view RGB-based & RGB-D-based ISLR:** In Table 5 and Table 6, we show performances of several RGB-based and RGB-D-based models on multi-view ISLR. The results highlight that using multiple views and additional modalities generally improves model performance. Models like UMDR and SAM-SLR, incorporating depth or 3D pose data, consistently achieve better results. This suggests these models effectively capture more comprehensive gesture information. The introduction of multi-view RGBD data inevitably raises the training costs of the model. Additionally, information redundancy in the data can potentially interfere with the model\u2019s learning process. For instance, the recognition accuracy of the NLA-SLR model, when trained on multi-view RGBD data, is lower compared to when it is trained solely on RGB data. For future research, we focus on developing more efficient methods to optimize performance without increasing complexity for multi-view and multi-modal data.\\n\\n**Cross-camera ISLR:** As illustrated in Table 7, there is a challenge in cross-camera ISLR on the MM-WL Auslan dataset. The results show a significant decline in accuracy when models trained on one type of camera are tested on the other one. Although two models, *i.e.*, KVNet-V [14] and\"}"]}

This highlights the substantial differences between the two cameras, emphasizing the complexity of achieving robust ISLR across varied hardware. The challenge of cross-camera ISLR underscores the need for developing models that can better generalize on data from various cameras.\\n\\nCross-view ISLR: We report the performance of two models, i.e., KVNet-V [14] and UMDR [73], training and evaluating on the data from different Kinect-v2 views, as shown in Table 8. UMDR, incorporating depth information alongside pixel data, generally exhibits greater resilience and performance compared to KVNet-V. Both models exhibit high accuracy under the single-view setting of our dataset, yet experience a significant drop in accuracy in the cross-view context. This indicates that models capable of adapting to diverse visual inputs are necessary to address the challenges posed by cross-view.\\n\\n5 Limitation and Future Work\\n\\nLimited Diversity in Data: As shown in Figure 3(a) of the main paper, we analyze the distribution of Caucasian, African, and Asian signers within the MM-WLAuslan dataset. We observe that the proportion of African signers is significantly lower than that of Caucasian and Asian signers. Consequently, the signers in our recordings do not fully represent the demographic diversity of the Auslan community. Australia, being a multi-cultural nation, encompasses a wide range of ethnicities, and the representation of these ethnicities in our dataset is crucial. Therefore, we will continue recording to achieve a more balanced representation.\\n\\nLack of Real-world Scenarios: Although we attempt to simulate real-life environments by altering backgrounds and capturing some data \u201cin the wild\u201d, these settings still fall short of fully representing the complexities of real-world scenarios, such as multi-person interactions and intricate backgrounds. Moving forward, we intend to capture real-world Auslan glosses for a more authentic dataset. This initiative aims to more accurately reflect the dynamic and diverse contexts in which Auslan is naturally used, thereby improving the relevance and applicability of the dataset.\"}"]}

Consequently, developing more effective multi-modal fusion and multi-view techniques tailored to the unique characteristics of our dataset is essential. This approach will enhance the accuracy and applicability of the models, ensuring they are better suited to address the specific challenges and nuances of isolated sign language recognition.\\n\\nInvestigating Isolated Sign Language Production Task: Sign Language Production is currently a popular task, involving not only the generation of isolated glosses [75] but also continuous sign language [76, 77]. Unlike previous datasets, ours incorporates multi-view and multi-modal capabilities, enabling the creation of more accurate 2D or 3D sign language representations. We plan to further explore this task using our dataset in future research. This will enhance the precision and effectiveness of sign language modelling, providing more robust tools for communication within the deaf and hard-of-hearing community.\\n\\n6 Conclusion\\n\\nIn this work, we introduce the first large-scale, multi-view, multi-modal word-level dataset for Australian Sign Language (Auslan), named MM-WLAuslan. The dataset includes 282K+ videos encompassing 3,215 distinct Auslan glosses performed by 73 signers. To the best of our knowledge, MM-WLAuslan has the largest amount of data, the most extensive vocabulary, and the most diverse set of multi-modal camera views. We position four RGB-D cameras, i.e., three Kinect-V2 cameras and a RealSense camera, hemispherically around the signers. Extensive experiments demonstrate the validity and challenges of MM-WLAuslan. Thanks to the cross-camera, multi-view, and multi-modal gloss videos, our dataset can be used for practical applications related with Auslan. Furthermore, the presented benchmark results can act as strong baselines for future research.\\n\\nAcknowledgement\\n\\nThis research is funded in part by ARC-Discovery grant (DP220100800 to XY), ARC-DECRA grant (DE230100477 to XY) and Google Research Scholar Program. We express our gratitude to Professor Trevor Cohn for his valuable feedback on this work. We also gratefully thank all the anonymous reviewers and ACs for their constructive comments.\\n\\nBroader Impact\\n\\nThe development of the word-level Australian Sign Language (Auslan) dataset has several impacts on technology, education, and society. Our proposed MM-WLAuslan, recorded using multi-view RGB-D cameras and focused on isolated Auslan glosses, brings about a wide range of positive effects:\\n\\n- **Improving Accuracy and Efficiency in ISLR:** The high-quality data provided by multi-view RGB-D cameras enhance the detailed capture of sign language gestures, which is crucial for developing efficient and accurate ISLR systems.\\n\\n- **Facilitating Social Integration for the Deaf:** Improved by our MM-WLAuslan dataset, the ISLR technology can provide the deaf and hard-of-hearing community with more efficient communication capabilities.\\n\\n- **Expanding Educational Resources:** Our dataset can support Auslan education [25, 78]. By providing multi-view demonstrations, the dataset allows Auslan learners to observe signs from different views, enhancing their understanding and accuracy in sign language.\\n\\n- **Driving Technological Innovation:** Our dataset offers valuable resources for research in computer vision and machine learning, promoting technological development and innovation in these fields [79, 80, 81, 82].\\n\\n- **Preserving and Promoting Culture:** By recording and utilizing the MM-WLAuslan dataset, we preserve and disseminate the unique cultural heritage of Australian Sign Language, enhancing public awareness of its cultural value [83].\\n\\nThese societal impacts demonstrate that the development and application of the Auslan dataset are not only technically significant but also have profound positive values on social and cultural levels.\"}"]}
