Designing generalizable evaluation processes remains a challenge, however, partly due to the vast number of possible domain, task and modality combinations and lack of knowledge of how informative they are. In this paper, we propose EEVEE (Efficient Evaluation process Evolution Engine)\\\\(^1\\\\), a method that frames evaluation process design as a learning problem. By analyzing a large number of evaluation metrics from diverse benchmarks and models, EEVEE identifies a smaller subset of tasks with high predictive power over the full set of evaluation metrics, reducing evaluation time. To find the optimal subset maximizing signal while minimizing GPU hours, EEVEE evaluates pre-trained models of various architectures, pretraining schemes, and modalities on diverse downstream tasks and datasets including image classification, segmentation, relational reasoning, zero-shot image-to-text tasks, medical classification and segmentation, video classification, and regression. Our results identify three subsets of benchmarks, with 8, 15 and 21 tasks, providing high quality signal for model generalization. Key benchmarks selected include iWildCam, CLEVR-Math, ACDC, WinoGround, CIFAR100, Fungi, and ADE20K. We structure the subsets into three tiers for 12, 24, and 36 GPU-hour budgets and package them into a unified, efficient, and user-friendly Python framework that we built with the researcher in mind \u2013 which we refer to as the GATE engine. Our experiments reveal ConvNextV2, SigLIP and CLIP as top-performing model encoders, with EfficientNetV2 and ResNext50 excelling in medical tasks and challenging image classification, in particular in Happy Whale Individual classification, ConvNet based models seem to outperform transformer models by a factor of 2.5x, which is surprising. The top performing encoder being ConvNextV2 followed by CLIP seems to agree with other recent large scale evaluations. We also demonstrate the framework\u2019s versatility in fine-tuning models from text and audio modalities, paving the way for future cross-modal evaluations.\\n\\n1 Introduction\\n\\nIncreasing Complexities of Benchmarking: As we create benchmarks for expanding model capability evaluation, the growing number and complexity of these benchmarks inadvertently complicates evaluation, requiring more resources like engineering, computation, and research time.

Few benchmarks have had as much impact as ImageNet [29], which remains a\\nrich resource for model training and evaluation, particularly in visuo-linguistic models. As key\\ncapabilities for deep neural networks were discovered, more benchmarks were generated to measure\\nand stimulate progress in those areas. In natural language processing, the GLUE benchmark [65],\\nSQuAD [45], and CoNLL-2003 [48] have been instrumental. In audio processing, LibriSpeech [39],\\nTIMIT [15], and VCTK [68] are widely used. For machine translation, WMT [3], IWSLT [22], and\\nEuroparl [25] have driven advancements. Relational reasoning has been advanced by benchmarks\\nsuch as CLEVR [23], bAbI [66], and RAVEN [71]. In segmentation, PASCAL VOC [14], Cityscapes\\n[8], and COCO [33] remain crucial. Large language models are often evaluated using benchmarks\\nlike SuperGLUE [64], LAMBADA [40], and MMLU [19]. Vision-language models are typically\\nevaluated using benchmarks such as VQA [1], Visual7W [76], and Flickr30k [42].\\n\\nAs a result, a researcher has to choose from all these options, and even more, and then find a\\nway to unify and experiment with their models across all of them. The lack of unification, and\\nthe lack of guarantees for their generalization signal, quickly becomes a kind of \u201cevaluation hell\u201d,\\nwhere researchers waste a lot of time just doing redundant things like fixing the same bugs to\\ndownload datasets, preprocess them etc, while at the same time not having any real signal as to which\\nbenchmarks are more informative, other than just knowing what has been used the most \u2013 which is\\nusually a function of popularity, and not real informativeness. To elaborate, the adoption of complex\\nevaluation processes that could enhance research efficiency and impact is often hindered by the\\nengineering effort required to evaluate machine learning models. Researchers must create involved\\npipelines across multiple datasets demanding high data engineering efforts, develop task-specific\\nadapters, and derive nuanced training recipes, which is time-consuming. As a result, researchers\\noften revert to simpler evaluation strategies instead of comprehensive assessments.\\n\\nA good benchmark should alleviate these burdens by automating dataset handling, integrating task\\nadapters, optimizers, schedulers, and logging mechanisms seamlessly. It should provide broad and\\nmeaningful signals with minimal GPU time, accommodating various computational budgets, ensuring\\ninclusivity. Furthermore, an increasingly important factor for a robust modern benchmark engine\\nis its support for multi-modal learning and early fusion techniques. AI systems must seamlessly\\nintegrate and reason across multiple modalities, such as text, images, audio, and more. Multi-modal\\nlearning enhances self-supervised learning opportunities and provides inherent supervision through\\nnatural alignments, like audio-visual synchronization in videos. Early fusion, where data from\\ndifferent modalities is combined at the initial stages of processing, allows models to leverage shared\\nrepresentations, improving generalization and reasoning capabilities across varied tasks and domains.\\nThese key desiderata are what motivates the production of this work.\\n\\nWith the desiderata in mind, we next introduce EEVEE, a methodology developed for building\\nhigh-signal low-cost evaluation routines, and GATE, the resulting benchmark that is designed to\\nbe extensible, readable, flexible, modular and robust, supported by a new efficient, easy to use\\nframework.\\n\\n**EEVEE, Learning Optimal Benchmarks:** The ability to find which benchmarks offer the most\\nsignal with respect to a given goal, such that we can optimize our compute time, research iteration\\nspeed, and engineering time is increasingly crucial. In this work, rather than just manually designing\\na new set of benchmarks, we propose a methodology, called **EEVEE (Empirical Evaluation process\\nEvolution Engine)** that frames evaluation design as a learning problem and then leverages machine\\nlearning to automate the discovery and refinement of evaluation processes.\\n\\nMore specifically, EEVEE operates by taking in a large set of performance metrics from diverse\\nmodels applied across various benchmarks and identifies a smaller subset of benchmarks with high\\npredictive power over the entire set. EEVEE achieves this through two main components: (a) an\\nevolutionary algorithm to optimize the selection of benchmark combinations based on a computed\\nscore, and (b) a meta-model trained to predict a model\u2019s performance on the full set of benchmarks\\nusing performance metrics from a chosen subset. We parameterize the meta-model as as a small\\nneural network.\"}"]}

For this purpose, we choose a pool of 20 models, varying in their pretraining schemes (e.g. CLIP, DINO, ImageNet Classification), architectures (e.g. ResNets, ViTs, ConvNext) and even their source modalities (e.g. Whisper, BERT), which we adapt on 31 benchmarks ranging from image classification, segmentation, relational reasoning, zero-shot image-to-text tasks, medical classification and segmentation, video classification, and regression, using robust fine tuning recipes, and training for 10K iterations, ensuring that the signal we get is about models that are adaptable, generalizable and efficient in their adaptation.\\n\\nBy applying 20 models on 31 benchmarks and employing EEVEE on their resulting metrics, we identify three subsets of benchmarks, each targeted to a specific computational budget range. Some of the key benchmarks that have been selected include iWildCam, CLEVR-Math, ACDC, WinoGround, mini-ImageNet, Fungi, ADE20K, and dtextures. We refer to the discovered subsets as **Tiers**, and assign to them identifiers for their sizes, specifically, **small** (n=8, 12 GPU hours), **base** (n=15, 24 GPU hours) and **big** (n=31, 36 GPU hours). We package these tiers into our comprehensive benchmarking suite and software framework (called **GATE**) designed for domain, task and modality transferability evaluation, which facilitates the transfer of neural network encoders to different modalities, domains, and tasks. GATE\u2019s architecture caters to the research community, enabling straightforward replacement of these transferable encoders with minimal effort. With these innovations, GATE seeks to evolve the landscape of model encoder evaluation, championing a deeper understanding of transfer learning and model adaptability.\\n\\n**Contributions:** 1. We introduce **EEVEE**, a machine learning approach for selecting subsets of benchmarks optimized to offer maximal predictive power over a larger benchmark set. 2. We conduct a comprehensive investigation of diverse benchmarks within the space of image, image+text and video modalities, pinpointing those with the highest predictive value for a model\u2019s performance in downstream tasks. We apply EEVEE to model encoder evaluation by training 20 models on 31 benchmarks, identifying subsets of 8, 15 and 21 benchmarks that offer high signal-to-GPU-hour ratios. 3. We pack the EEVEE-discovered subsets (of 8, 15 and 21 benchmarks out of 31 benchmarks) into targeted benchmark packs, referred to as tiers, designed for specific compute budgets (of 12, 24 and 36 GPU hours) and project phases, and establish standard experimental settings for these tiers. We call these collectively as the **GATE** Benchmarks. 4. We develop the **GATE** engine, a unified benchmark suite and software framework that automates dataset downloading, preprocessing, and pipelining for fine tuning and evaluation. GATE facilitates the incorporation of new model encoders, adapts input modalities, fine-tunes with robust recipes, and logs critical information such as training and evaluation metrics, power, energy, computational usage, task visualizations, and model gradients per layer. 5. Through our extensive investigation, we identify foundation models demonstrating superior transferability across diverse tasks. 6. We advocate for the inclusion of modality-shifting transfer experiments in the standard evaluation process for ML researchers, supported by our experimental results on the performance of existing foundation models in these benchmarks.\\n\\n## 2 Related Work\\n\\n**On the Diversity of Benchmarks:** There is a vast array of benchmark suites in machine learning. To the best of our knowledge, the benchmark suites relating strongly to GATE are ImageNet [9], VTAB [70], VLMBench [73] and WILDS [26]. ImageNet has been of tremendous importance and interest to the transfer learning community. Nevertheless, there has been skepticism about overfitting to such datasets resulting from implicitly qualifying models using the test set performance over the years [46,6] or the test set not being challenging enough to gauge model generalization power [47]. Although ImageNet pre-training helps transfer performance to the many-shot classification setting [13], it provides minimal to no gains on more challenging datasets such as fine-grained\"}"]}

Similarly, with a larger distribution shift, ImageNet pre-trained models was found to offer limited benefits for medical imaging tasks due to large distribution shifts induced by fundamental differences in data sizes, features, and task specifications; that is, lightweight models perform comparably to standard architectures [44]. To make matters worse, ImageNet performance is less correlated with and less predictive of downstream performance on diverse tasks beyond classification such as object detection, few-shot classification, and segmentation [13]. On top of it all, when ImageNet is extended with a perturbed temporal dimension, models performance significantly worsen [52].\\n\\n**On the Usability of Benchmarks:** Beyond ImageNet, VTAB introduced a benchmark with a wider diversity of tasks and domains [70]. Nevertheless, it does not offer task and domain shifts offered in GATE, such as medical segmentation and video classification and regression that are known to be ill-measured and gauged by ImageNet alone [44, 52]. That said, VTAB offers satellite imaging and 3D tasks which GATE does not. Nevertheless, GATE as a software framework was optimized to minimise usage friction, to take no more than 12 GPU hours on our smallest tier, and, to only require approximately 1 hour of adding the new encoder and wrapping it into GATE wrappers for GATE to be able to go away and take care of everything, including dataset downloading, task adapter integration and full train/val and test cycles with logging of various key metrics. VTAB, in our experience, requires a lot more manual work in getting the datasets, and integrating new models to be adapted. Similarly, VLMBench [73] and WILDS [26] offer more diverse datasets beyond previous work but neither offer a tiered approach that enables iterative development of models during pre-training, nor produce extensible and flexible benchmarks that can be easily glued into researchers experimentation code without friction.\\n\\n**On the Systematic Selection of Benchmarks:** Previous work investigated the properties inherit in multi-task benchmarks that trade-off diversity and sensitivity where the latter is how robust a benchmark ranking is to the inclusion of irrelevant models or minute changes in the tasks themselves [72]. It was found that multi-task benchmark are unstable to irrelevant changes in tasks design. Nevertheless, this is related to how the benchmark ranks models; whether it compares how model often ranks higher than another in cardinal benchmarks or if the performance across tasks is averaged to produce a single rank in cardinal ones. Meanwhile, our benchmark produces fine-grained information to model performances across diverse tasks rather than producing specific ranking which is delegated to the user analysis. Another complementary thread of work investigates dynamic benchmarks where model training and data collection is interleaved to continually challenge model knowledge [53]. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that studies the selection of multi-task, multi-domain benchmarks that satisfy limited compute budgets while maximizing research signal.\\n\\nIn summary, Table 1 shows the desiderata that we believe a good evaluation suite and framework should have such that they can both offer the community useful signal, and also balance that with being practical so that people can adopt it.\\n\\n### 3 EEVEE Methodology\\n\\nEEVEE is our proposed method for automating the selection of Pareto-optimal benchmark subsets. By analyzing benchmark performance metrics, EEVEE identifies a small, highly informative subset that maximizes information relative to the entire benchmark pool. This ensures that, as machine learning benchmark breadth and depth increases, we will always be able to identify and select few that offer high information about the whole. We strike a balance between providing rich evaluation signals and maintaining simplicity, reducing computational costs and human efforts required for adopting new benchmarks. EEVEE enables the production of a tiered evaluation engine accommodating various computational budgets, fostering an inclusive and accessible research environment, and improving the quality of insights derived from machine learning research while addressing reluctance.\"}"]}

This balance between efficiency, simplicity, and signal richness presents EEVE\u2019s value proposition for advancing machine learning research.\\n\\n**Working Principle of EEVEE:** EEVEE works by building a *meta-model* over the performance metrics of models sufficient both in number and diversity, on the full benchmark pool from which we want to choose our subset. With the term *benchmark* in this paper we refer to a dataset + task pairs.\\n\\nFormally, given a large benchmark pool $B = \\\\{b_0, b_1, \\\\ldots, b_K\\\\}$, where $B$ is the full set of benchmarks, and $b_i$ are individual benchmarks therein, we have a sufficiently large and diverse pool of model performance metrics $M = \\\\{m^0_i, m^1_i, \\\\ldots, m^K_i\\\\}$. Here, $m^j_i$ is the performance metric of model $j$ on benchmark $b_i$. We aim to discover a subset of $B$ of size $k$. This means $k$ total benchmarks make up the subset. If we build a meta-model $g(M_{selected}, \\\\theta)$ to predict all of $M$ given only the selected subset $M_{selected}$, it should minimize the following loss:\\n\\n$$L_{EEVEE} = \\\\text{MSE}(M, g(M_{selected}, \\\\theta))$$  \\\\hspace{1cm} (1)\\n\\nIn this equation, MSE is the mean squared error. $M$ represents the full set of performance metrics of all our models on the full benchmark pool $B$. The term $g(M_{selected}, \\\\theta)$ represents the predictions of the meta-model $g$ with parameters $\\\\theta$ when it is given the performance metrics of all models from the selected subset of benchmarks $B_{selected}$, referred to as $M_{selected}$.\\n\\nHowever, our main focus lies in the selected combination of performance metrics $M_{selected}$ that can generalize well on previously unseen models. To that end, we must split $M$ into train, validation and test sets, each consisting of performance metrics acquired from different models (e.g. train $\\\\rightarrow$ ResNet50, ViT-Base, CLIP, and val $\\\\rightarrow$ ResNext50, DINO, DeIT), and explicitly optimize the inner loop test loss rather than the training loss, while we use the validation loss to select the best meta-model for test. Hence the loss we wish to minimize is:\\n\\n$$L_{test}^{EEVEE} = \\\\text{MSE}(M^{test}, g(M^{test}_{selected}, \\\\theta))$$  \\\\hspace{1cm} (2)\\n\\nWe need a non-differentiable method for choosing the $k$ benchmarks in $M_{selected}$, since brute force becomes intractable very quickly, so we employ evolutionary methods to learn the $k$ selected benchmarks.\\n\\nThis results in a bi-level optimization, with an evolutionary method on the outer loop $e(B_{selected})$, where $e$ is the evolutionary method, and $B_{selected}$ are the benchmarks being selected \u2013 or indeed, the genes being optimized, and a small meta-model parameterized as a neural network $g(\\\\theta)$ that receives a train/val split from $B_{selected}$ and trains itself to do the task described in Equation 1 after which process it is scored using the val set using the loss in Equation 2. Then, once a given candidate of benchmarks $B_{selected}$ is scored, in this way, the outer loop performs a tournament selection where only the top 50 candidates are preserved and mutated by removing one benchmark at random, and adding another at random. Each winning candidate mutates into 10 children, and the parent is also preserved in the gene pool, producing a gene pool with 550 candidates for every cycle. At initialization, we sample 1000 random combinations. We have found that 1000 is a good starting population that is both tractable to score and facilitates the necessary diversity that enables limited variation in results across several runs, showcasing convergent behaviour. diversity that our results across runs have little variation from one another, pointing to a convergent behaviour. We include full pseudocode showcasing all the details related to how we performed EEVEE for our experiments in Algorithm 1, 2 and 3 in Figure 1.\\n\\n**Applying EEVEE on Model Encoder Generalization**\\n\\n**Why Model Encoder Evaluation?** A common practice across machine learning applications involves augmenting general model encoders with task-oriented heads. The adaption of this paradigm can be attributed to the computational efficiency associated with training model encoders, over more expensive setups. Much of computer vision, as well as vision to text search and retrieval happen using model encoders. Similarly, various applications requiring translation from one domain/modality/task to another require an encoder of some sort. Even the \u201cdecoder-only\u201d LLM models that have demonstrated incredible capabilities in the last few years, internally can be seen as a series of representation encoders, a series of refinement before they reach the decoding stage.\"}"]}

World model research in multi-modal dimensions can also take place most efficiently within a model-encoder context. Recent works like I/VJEPA [2] for example have paved the way for self-supervised learning which functions using model encoders, and has been demonstrated to be more efficient and more generalizable than full pixel decoding variants.\\n\\nFurthermore, model encoder evaluation has been quite diffused in the past few years, with new benchmarks being produced in every facet of the machine learning field. Nonetheless, most of those lacked in some key quality: they were either simply too complex to use efficiently, requiring too much compute, or, more often than the others, missing a unifying software framework that can easily, in a user-conscious way, and a principled stance towards high readability, maintainability and hackability.\\n\\n**The goal of focusing on Model Encoder Evaluation:** By applying EEVEE to search for a pareto-optimal set of benchmarks, and packaging it up in a unified framework that is built for the researcher in mind from the ground up, one which offers out of the box automated downloading, pipeline building, task adapters, and a very mature training and eval loop. Within this framework, we facilitate, all relevant logging information, including key training and eval metrics, rich gradient information, power and computational information, as well as visualizations where relevant.

Each having 8, 15 and 21 benchmarks within it, and targetted towards 12/24 and 36 GPU hours on a A100 40GB. We hope that by making it very easy for the end user and offering such rich signal for machine learning research, many researchers will choose to use GATE, to enhance their research signal, whilst keeping the compute budgets relatively feasible.\\n\\n**Preparations: Choosing Models, Benchmarks and Adaptation Processes:** EEVEE will yield better results if the space of models, benchmarks and adaptation processes we use is diverse, but also thorough in numbers. **A. Adaptation Process** We wanted GATE to cover multiple domains, tasks and modalities when shifting from the source to the target setting. For that reason we decided that if a model encoder has an input layer that does not fit the target modality, we simply remove that input layer and replace it with a relevant ViT-like patchification [12] followed by a linear combination for each patch. For tasks where we have text, we would tokenize the text using BPE [51], and for tasks where we have video we would use the model encoder on each image, to acquire an image-level vector representation, and then follow that up with a simple 4 layer transformer that receives a sequence of image-vector tokens, to produce a video-level embedding, on top of which we apply the task-specific head at hand. The task-adapters we used leaned on established methods, and where possible we just used a transformer head, which includes segmentation, relational reasoning and video classification, with everything just using a linear head, full details available at [14].

Benchmark Pool The benchmark pool, detailed in the Appendix, includes Image Classification (ImageNet1k [9], CIFAR100 [28], Places365 [74], Food101 [36], HappyWhale [17]), Few Shot Image Classification (Aircraft [37], Fungi [50], MiniImageNet [62], CUB200 [63], Describable Features [69]), Zero Shot Text-Image Classification (Flickr30K [41], New Yorker Caption Context [20], Winoground [58]), Visual Relational Reasoning (CLEVR [23], CLEVRMath [34]), Image Semantic Segmentation (ADE20K [75], COCO10K [33], COCO164K [33], NYU-Depth-v2 [54], PascalContext [38], Cityscapes [8]), Medical Image Classification (Chexpert [21], Diabetic Retinopathy [16], HAM10000 [60]), Medical Segmentation (ACDC [5]), Video Classification (HMDB51 [30], UCF-101 [56], Kinetics400 [24]) and Video Regression (iWildcam [4]).\\n\\nProducing Diverse Model Performance Metrics: We apply our adaptation process on each and every model chosen, on every benchmark in the benchmark pool. To acquire test results we ensemble by averaging logits of the top 1, 3 and 5 validation models to produce three separate ensemble results.\\n\\nD. Experimental Approach We wanted our research environment to reflect the end user, so we can properly understand their needs, and to offer a pragmatic experimental setup of in-the-wild researchers with little time to hyperparameter optimize, and which have to make decisions on small amounts of preliminary experiments \u2013 someone choosing a model encoder off the shelf and adapting it to downstream setting. For that reason, we kept any hyperparameter tuning, or human attention when it came to specific models to a minimum. Instead, we relied on existing good recipes, and did some preliminary experiments as explained in detail in 8.1. Briefly, we discovered specific adjustments for each architecture type: for Convolutional Architectures, we used AdamW with a learning rate of 1e-3, and 6e-4 for segmentation tasks; for Vision Transformer Architectures, AdamW with a learning rate of 1e-5; and for Convolutional + Transformer Hybrid Architectures, AdamW with a learning rate of 2e-5. A plateau learning rate scheduler was configured with parameters like mode \\\"min\\\", factor 0.5, patience 1000, and threshold 1e-4, allowing models to effectively choose their own schedules based on their learning progress. This adaptive scheduling facilitated \u201cgood enough\u201d learning rates and enhanced performance across different architectures.\\n\\n4 Results\\n\\nSingle Benchmark Predictiveness: As demonstrated in Figure 3 using EEVEE we quantified the predictive power of each benchmark on its own, when not in a combination with others. We have found that ADE20K, Flickr30K, and the New York Caption Competition lead in their predictive power, with few-shot tasks, and relational reasoning, being very close to the best in predictive power. ImageNet1K sits squarely in the middle of the competition. Furthermore, some of the most \u201cnovel\u201d\"}"]}

We argue that this is mainly due to the tasks being \u201charder\u201d, and our models being less designed for those. The results in WinoGround were bearly better than chance for example. However, when once we move to combinations of benchmarks, these \u2018less\u2019 predictive benchmarks become key contributors to better predictive power, as they represent edge cases, as can be seen in Figures 6g 7c 7i where these have the highest importance when removed from a given set.\\n\\nPredictiveness of Discovered Combinations In Figure 5 we can see how the top-50 performing candidate combinations perform as we vary the number of benchmarks per combination from 1 to 26. We can see that there is a point of diminishing returns around the $k = 8$ point, after which there appears to be some \u201coverfitting\u201d occurring. We verified that the overfitting was a result of having a small sample number of 20 models, to train, val and test our meta-models with, as well as the 2-layer MLP we used to model Few-to-All metric predictions. We tried our level best to find the best architecture and regularization schemes for our meta-model, and this was the best we could do given available compute and (human) time. We chose 8, 15, and 21 as the combination-threshold to make our packs out of as they satisfied the computational budgets we set for ourselves, and they have very diverse and predictive tasks, as can be seen in Figures 6g 7c 7i. For full details on all the discovered top-k combinations please look at Appendix Section 16.1.\\n\\nBest Models based on GATE: As can be seen in Table 2 or the Appendix extended Table 3, the best overall models are ConvNextV2, SigLIP and CLIP in that order, with SigLIP and CLIP often exchanging ranks between themselves. However, it is worth noting that EfficientNetV2 demonstrated exceptional performance/compute across all tasks, and even outperformed all models in many medical tasks. Finally, ConvNet based models, and particularly ResNext50 seem to have done exceptionally well in the edge-case scenarios of ACDC, Happy Whale Individual identification, and\"}"]}

Especially with benchmarks targeting the text and audio modalities, as well as potentially offline RL.\\n\\n5 Conclusion\\n\\nIn this paper, we propose EEVEE, an evolutionary-method-based search algorithm that can discover out of a large collection of benchmarks, the ones that can offer the most predictive value on the original collection, for a given set of models. We apply EEVEE on the task of model-encoder evaluation in the context of images, image-text, videos, and medical domains. As a result, we obtain the GATE Benchmark, which consists of 3 tiers, each targeted to a particular GPU budget, from 12, 24 and 36 GPU hours, per model evaluation. We then introduce the GATE engine, which takes these benchmarks, and offers a researcher-designed environment in which one can easily port their own model encoder, and run the full GATE tiers, and automatically produce a variety of performance, energy/power, hardware utilization metrics and task visualizations. We evaluated 20 representative models ranging from image, image-text, text and audio pretrained models, on the GATE tiers, and we discovered that ConvNextV2 and SigLIP seem to lead the pack overall, with EfficientNetV2 being an exceptional, efficient alternative for the medical domain and for unique scenario tasks, such as Happy Whale, ACDC and WinoGround. Finally, ConvNet based models, and ResNext50 in particular, seem to have a lot more learning efficiency, as they are the best adapted models on very novel domains, such as Happy Whale individual prediction challenge, ACDC and medical tasks.\"}"]}

Install the GATE framework python package, as described in the Github repo\u2019s readme page.\\n\\n2. Choose a path for implementing the new foundation model encoder they wish to evaluate. This is either cloning the full GATE repo and modifying existing components directly, or, importing the GATEncoder and GATEModel classes from GATE, and wrapping up their model within it. Doing so requires the researcher to implement a relevant forward function that can take in the modalities their model needs to process, as well as defining a configuration that tells GATE what modalities a model can receive and output features on, as well as any transforms needed for a batch to be ready for their model.\\n\\n3. The user chooses a GATE tier to use (from smallGATE, baseGATE and bigGATE). Based on the configuration defined by the user in step 2.\\n\\n4. GATE generates a list of commands, each representing an experiment that needs to be run, and can then run these commands on your local GPU box, parallelizing the tasks, one on each available GPU, or, can provide a list of commands or json file that one can use to run these commands on a GPU cluster, or other hardware.\\n\\n5. GATE emits a wandb project, with metrics, visualizations and other measures, allowing easy tracking of experiments, and sharing thereof, as well as huggingface model weights for each model being trained \u2013 which is also used to achieve a stateless execution.\\n\\n6. Once the experiments are completed, one can invoke the produce-analysis.py file within GATE to get tables and figures that analyse the data, similar to what appears in this paper. Those results can then be used to report results in a paper, or, be used to make decisions for production models.\\n\\nThis process ensures the GATE framework is aware of what a model\u2019s supported modalities are, as well as how to produce modality-specific features, given the model. Once this is completed, the user, with a single line of code, can select a GATE tier, and launch all jobs needed to produce results for that tier. Importantly, GATE is made to facilitate and encourage foundation models that are diverse in their capabilities, and allow the researchers to focus on what matters \u2013 that is, designing and training their foundation model \u2013 rather than spending the majority of their time building and optimizing evaluation boilerplate. Furthermore, the diversity of signal that GATE provides allows better understanding of a given model\u2019s strengths and weaknesses, which as a result makes the research, review and iteration process of the field as a whole more efficient. This is because there is a consistent boilerplate that runs all models, with broad signal that reduces probability of making erroneous conclusions \u2013 both in the overly optimistic, or overly pessimistic side of things.\\n\\n6.1 Principal Use Cases\\n\\n1. **Model Development and Iteration**: GATE serves as a valuable tool during the model research and development phase. By integrating the model into GATE and running either the smallGATE or baseGATE tiers, developers can obtain a comprehensive and robust performance evaluation of their model across diverse domains, tasks, and modalities. Worth noting that GATE allows easy inclusion of foundation models pretrained on images, video, audio, text, etc, to be fine-tuned on pixel-based tasks. It achieves this by replacing a model\u2019s root layer / embedding layer, with one appropriate for a given task\u2019s modality, and adding on top a relevant task adapter head.\\n\\n2. **Model Evaluation for Machine Learning Research**: GATE enhances the communication of research findings and their potential applications, a vital aspect of scientific collaboration. By using GATE as a benchmark, even at the most cost-efficient GPU hour level of smallGATE, the clarity and depth of future ML papers can be significantly improved. GATE\u2019s explicit evaluation of modality, domain, and task shifts in a given foundation model provides a nuanced and informative perspective on a model\u2019s true capabilities, offering a more detailed understanding of a model\u2019s strengths and weaknesses than optimizing a single metric, such as ImageNet validation error.\"}"]}

Much of the logged information outside of testing metrics were not used for any of the figures and tables in this paper.

We averaged the results of any metrics across such independent runs to acquire a better approximation to the true performance of those models.\\n\\n8 Preliminary Experiments Details\\n\\n8.1 Preliminary Experiments\\n\\nFirst, we trained models on ImageNet1k, CIFAR100, CLEVR, ADE20K, CityScapes, and, ACDC for 5K iterations, using cosine annealing learning schedule or plateau annealing, with AdamW, weight decays varying from 0.1 - 0.0001, and applied models from each major architecture category \u2013 specifically, the CLIPViT, ImageNet pretrained ViT, ResNext, ResNet and ConvNextV2. The results from these experiments pointed to the fact that there exists one general and good recipe for each architecture style. The recipes that we discovered were as follows:\\n\\n8.1.1 Across Architecture Settings\\n\\nUnless otherwise stated, the settings here are applied universally in all experiments.\\n\\n**Optimizer**: AdamW, weight decay 0.01, plateau annealing with patience 1000, relative scaling and scale factor 0.5, and, threshold 0.0001.\\n\\n**Training Details**: Training iterations: 10K, validate every 500 iterations.\\n\\n**Test Details**: Top-3 validation models (across all validated checkpoints) are ensembled by prediction averaging.\\n\\n8.1.2 Architecture Specific Settings\\n\\n**Convolutional Architectures**: **Optimizer**: AdamW, learning rate 1e-3, and for segmentation tasks only, we used learning rate 6e-4\\n\\n**Vision Transformer Architectures**: **Optimizer**: AdamW, learning rate 1e-5\\n\\n**Convolutional + Transformer Hybrid Architectures**: **Optimizer**: AdamW, learning rate 2e-5\\n\\nThe above recipes were what we used throughout all our experiments unless otherwise stated.\\n\\n9 GATE Guiding Principles\\n\\nThe fundamental values driving the design decisions behind GATE are the following:\\n\\n1. Maximizing Generalization Signal: GATE is designed to provide a high signal-to-noise ratio concerning a model\u2019s ability to generalize in diverse downstream contexts, that vary in domain, task and modality. This allows for a more robust assessment of a model\u2019s capacity for adaptation and versatility. By noise here we refer to how clear a given signal response is.

Time Efficiency: Acknowledging the importance of computational resources and time,\\nGATE operates within set benchmarks of 12, 24, and 36 GPU hours (established on A100 @\\n40GB). These set timeframes ensure GATE\u2019s assessments are both thorough and expedient.\\n\\n3. Minimizing Usage Friction: The framework supporting GATE is designed to be user-friendly,\\nenabling easy integration of new backbones and facilitating smooth experimentation. This\\nlow-friction approach ensures a streamlined experience when using GATE, making the\\nprocess of evaluation more efficient.\\n\\nWe argue that a good balance of the above can generate a pragmatic, yet thorough foundation model\\nevaluation suite, that will, importantly, be of real use to most researchers in the field.\\n\\n10 Defining the GATE Benchmark\\n\\nGATE is a comprehensive evaluation engine designed to advance the development of more general\\nmachine learning models. It improves on existing benchmarks by enabling the evaluation of models\\nacross diverse modalities, domains, and tasks.\\n\\nGATE is composed of three key components. The first is a benchmark pool, a broad collection of\\ndatasets, tasks, and processes that measure a model\u2019s performance across various domains, tasks,\\nand modalities. The second component is a set of benchmark tiers, which are meticulously curated\\nsubsets from the GATE benchmark pool, tailored to specific compute budgets and project phases.\\nThe final, and is a software framework, designed to seamlessly integrate new foundation models and\\nexecute the GATE tiers, thereby enabling efficient performance evaluation across a diverse range of\\ndownstream modalities, domains, and tasks. Practically, GATE is directed towards machine learning\\nresearchers and developers as a means to efficiently, and with little friction, get broad signal about\\nhow their model performs after transfer in diverse contexts, specifically selected for their empirically\\nevaluated high signal-to-noise ratio with respect to predictive power in how a model performs in\\npreviously unseen contexts.\\n\\nBuilding GATE was a careful balancing act. We needed to respect specific time budgets while also\\naiming for a wide variety of evaluation scenarios. Our approach was as follows:\\n\\n1. Select a diverse set of learning contexts, spanning multiple domains, tasks and modalities.\\n   We refer this as the Benchmark Pool.\\n\\n2. Select a broad set of key foundation models, varying in their architecture, pretraining scheme\\n   and source modality. We refer to this as the Model Pool.\\n\\n3. Fine tune each of the models in the model pool, on each of the contexts in the benchmark\\n   pool. Evaluate trained models on each context\u2019s test sets.\\n\\n4. Use the test set results acquired to quantify the predictive power each benchmark holds with\\n   respect to previously unseen benchmarks, both at the individual level and the collection\\n   level. We call this measure, the downstream generalization predictability measure (DGPM).\\n\\n5. Use the DGPM values of the various combinations of benchmarks to build the three GATE\\ntiers, selecting combinations of benchmarks that can provide the most information within a\\ntarget time budget.\\n\\nWe elaborate on each of the above steps in the following subsections.\\n\\n11 Benchmark Pool Selection Details\\n\\nMedical Image Classification: Medical data are known to present a substantial shift in both domain\\nand even modality depending on their format. We have selected datasets that not only pose significant\\nchallenges for foundation models but also align with the broader imperative to deliver real-world\\nbenefits downstream.\"}"]}

The authors should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the implications would be.\\n   - The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.\\n   - The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach. For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution is low or images are taken in low lighting.

For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general, releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.\\n- While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example\\n  (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm.\\n  (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully.\\n  (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).\\n  (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.\\n\\n5. **Open access to data and code**\\n\\nQuestion: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instructions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental material?\"}"]}

Safeguards\\n\\nQuestion: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models, image generators, or scraped datasets)?\\n\\nAnswer: [NA]\\n\\nJustification: It\u2019s a benchmark with datasets that are already public and previously published in other papers.\\n\\nGuidelines:\\n\\n\u2022 The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.\\n\\n\u2022 Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing safety filters.\\n\\n\u2022 Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.\\n\\n\u2022 We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best faith effort.\\n\\n12. Licenses for existing assets\\n\\nQuestion: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and properly respected?\\n\\nAnswer: [Yes]\\n\\nJustification: All datasets used have appropriate licenses, and the code packages used in implementing our software framework have appropriate licenses as well.\\n\\nGuidelines:\\n\\n\u2022 The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.\\n\\n\u2022 The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.\\n\\n\u2022 The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a URL.\\n\\n\u2022 The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.\\n\\n\u2022 For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of service of that source should be provided.\\n\\n\u2022 If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the license of a dataset.\"}"]}

This includes details about training, license, limitations, etc.\\n   \u2022 The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose asset is used.\\n   \u2022 At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.\\n\\n14. **Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects**\\n\\n   Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as well as details about compensation (if any)?\\n\\n   Answer: [NA]\\n\\n   Justification: No crowdsourcing with humans\\n\\n   Guidelines:\\n   \u2022 The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.\\n   \u2022 Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribution of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be included in the main paper.\\n   \u2022 According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation, or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data collector.\\n\\n15. **Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human Subjects**\\n\\n   Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or institution) were obtained?\\n\\n   Answer: [NA]\\n\\n   Justification: Same as previous answer.\\n\\n   Guidelines:\\n   \u2022 The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.\\n   \u2022 Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent) may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you should clearly state this in the paper.\\n   \u2022 We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the guidelines for their institution.\\n   \u2022 For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.\"}"]}
