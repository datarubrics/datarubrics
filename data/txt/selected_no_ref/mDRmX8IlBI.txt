Figure 1: MMWorld covers seven broad disciplines and 69 subdisciplines, focusing on the evaluation
of multi-faceted reasoning beyond perception (e.g., explanation, counterfactual thinking, future
prediction, domain expertise). On the right is a video sample from the Health & Medicine discipline.
Abstract
Multimodal Language Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate the emerging1
abilities of "world models"—interpreting and reasoning about complex real-world2
dynamics. To assess these abilities, we posit videos are the ideal medium, as they3
encapsulate rich representations of real-world dynamics and causalities. To this4
end, we introduce MMWorld, a new benchmark for multi-discipline, multi-faceted5
multimodal video understanding. MMWorld distinguishes itself from previous6
video understanding benchmarks with two unique advantages: (1)multi-discipline,7
covering various disciplines that often require domain expertise for comprehensive8
understanding; (2) multi-faceted reasoning, including explanation, counterfactual9
thinking, future prediction, etc. MMWorld consists of a human-annotated dataset10
to evaluate MLLMs with questions about the whole videos and a synthetic dataset11
to analyze MLLMs within a single modality of perception. Together, MMWorld12
encompasses 1,910 videos across seven broad disciplines and 69 subdisciplines,13
complete with 6,627 question-answer pairs and associated captions. The evaluation14
includes 2 proprietary and 10 open-source MLLMs, which struggle on MMWorld15
(e.g., GPT-4V performs the best with only 52.3% accuracy), showing large room16
for improvement. Further ablation studies reveal other interesting findings such17
as models’ different skill sets from humans. We hope MMWorld can serve as an18
essential step towards world model evaluation in videos.19

1 Introduction20
Foundation models, such as Large Language Models (LLMs) [49; 59; 26; 2] and Multimodal LLMs21
(MLLMs) [51; 58; 36; 33; 45; 10], have demonstrated remarkable abilities in text and image domains,22
igniting debates about their potential pathways to Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). This raises a23
critical question: how well do these models understand the dynamics of the real world? Are they24
equipped with an inherent World Model [28; 11; 21; 65] that can understand and reason about the25
underlying principles and causalities of the dynamic, multimodal world?26
Videos, with their rich, dynamic portrayal of the real world, are ideally suited for evaluating the27
"world modeling" capabilities of MLLMs. Existing video understanding benchmarks [34; 47; 53; 34],28
however, fall short in two key perspectives for such evaluations. First, as LeCun et al. [28] discussed,29
the world model should be able to (1) estimate missing information about the state of the world30
not provided by perception, and (2) predict plausible future states of the world. Evaluation of such31
capabilities requires multi-faceted reasoning beyond perception level, including explaining the32
video dynamics, counterfactual thinking of alternative consequences, and predicting future activities33
within videos. Moreover, the multi-discipline nature of the multimodal world necessitates a grasp of34
diverse fundamental principles—ranging from physics and chemistry to engineering and business.35
Hence, domain expertise across a variety of disciplines is imperative for a thorough evaluation of a36
model’s world understanding towards AGI [46; 73].37
Therefore, we introduce MMWorld, a multi-discipline multi-faceted multimodal video understanding38
benchmark for a comprehensive evaluation of MLLMs2. MMWorld encompasses a wide range of39
disciplines and presents multi-faceted reasoning challenges that demand a combination of visual,40
auditory, and temporal understanding. It consists of 1,910 videos that span seven common disciplines,41
including Art & Sports, Business, Science, Health & Medicine, Embodied Tasks, Tech & Engineering,42
and Games, and 69 subdisciplines (see Figure 1) such as Robotics, Chemistry, Trading, and Agricul-43
ture, thereby fulfilling the objective of breadth in discipline coverage. The dataset includes a total44
of 1,559 question-answer pairs and captions annotated and reviewed by humans. Meanwhile, for45
multi-faceted reasoning, MMWorld mainly contains seven kinds of questions focusing onexplanation46
(explaining the phenomenon in videos), counterfactual thinking(answering what-if questions), future47
prediction (predicting future events), domain expertise(answering domain-specific inquiries), tem-48
poral understanding(reasoning about temporal information), and etc. A video example with these49
four questions from the Health & Medicine discipline is depicted in Figure 1. MMWorld comprises50
two datasets: a human-annotated dataset for evaluating MLLMs on the whole video and a synthetic51
dataset designed to analyze MLLMs’ perception within single visual or audio modalities. We evaluate52
12 MLLMs that can handle videos or image sequences on MMWorld, including both open-source53
(e.g., Video-LLaV A-7B [36]) and proprietary models (GPT-4V [51] and Gemini [58]).54
We summarized the contributions and key findings as follows:55
• We introduce MMWorld, a new benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate the capabilities of56
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in world modeling through the realm of video57
understanding. MMWorld spans a broad spectrum of disciplines, featuring a rich array of question58
types for multi-faceted reasoning.59
• In addition to the human-annotated dataset, we develop an automatic data collection pipeline,60
streamlining video content selection and question-answer generation, and construct a well-61
controlled synthetic dataset to analyze MLLMs within single visual or audio modalities.62
• We observe that existing MLLMs still face substantial challenges posed by MMWorld. Even the63
best performer, GPT-4V , can only achieve a 52.30% overall accuracy, and four MLLMs particularly64
trained on videos perform worse than random chance.65
• Although there is stll a clear gap between open-source and proprietary models, the best open-source66
model Video-LLaV A-7B outperforms GPT-4V and Gemini on Embodied Tasks by a large margin67
2Note that MMWorld is not a sufficient testbed for world model evaluation, but we believe overcoming the
unique challenges presented in MMWorld is essential and necessary towards comprehensive world modeling.

and performs similarly on Art & Sports, where spatiotemporal dynamics play a more crucial68
role in video understanding. This is further validated with its leading results on the Temporal69
Understanding question type.70
• In our study comparing MLLMs with average humans (non-experts), we notice some correlation71
between question difficulties as perceived by humans and MLLMs. However, MLLMs present72
different skill sets than humans in that they can answer reasonable amount of difficult questions73
that humans completely fail but also struggle at easy questions that humans excel at. This indicates74
different perception, cognition, and reasoning abilities between MLLMs and humans.75
2 Related Work76
2.1 Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)77
Emerging MLLMs With recent breakthroughs [50; 18; 59; 12; 60; 4] in Large Language Models78
(LLMs), several counterparts in the vision-and-language domain have been proposed [ 14; 41; 40;79
30; 78; 77; 5], and recently released GPT-4V [51], followed by Gemini Vision family [58]. Many80
MLLMs have expanded their capabilities beyond handling only text and image inputs. VideoChat [33]81
leverages the QFormer [32] to map visual representations to LLM [12], and performs a multi-stage82
training pipeline. Otter [30] proposes to conduct instruction finetuning based on Openflamingo [3].83
PandaGPT [56] employs the ImageBind [23] as the backbone and finetunes it. mPLUG-Owl [ 68]84
introduces an abstractor module to perform visual and language alignment. VideoLLaMA [ 75]85
introduces a frame embedding layer and also leverages ImageBind to inject temporal and audio86
information into the LLM backend. Chat-UniVi [27] uses clustering to do feature fusion. Observing87
their emerging abilities in multimodal video understanding, we propose MMWorld to evaluate these88
models’ skills in understanding the dynamics of the real world.89
Benchmarking MLLMs To evaluate MLLMs, there is a flourishing of analysis [38; 76; 43; 15; 13;90
20; 70; 16] and the establishment of innovative benchmarks such as VisIB-Bench [8] which evaluates91
models with real-world instruction-following ability given image inputs, MMMU [ 73] designed92
to access models on college-level image-question pairs that span among different disciplines, and93
VIM [44] which challenges the model’s visual instruction following capability. However, these recent94
analyses and benchmarks only cover the image input, which hinders the evaluation of MLLM’s95
performance as a world model. Recently, video benchmarks such as Perception Test [53] is proposed96
to focus on perception and skills like memory and abstraction. However, it uses scenarios with a97
few objects manipulated by a person, which limits the variety of contexts. MVBench [34] centers on98
temporal understanding, while MMWorld not only includes temporal reasoning but also evaluates99
other multi-faceted reasoning abilities.100

2.2 Video Understanding Benchmarks101
Previous video benchmarks, as shown in Table 1, focus on video understanding tasks, including102
activity-focused on web videos [ 72], description-based question answering [ 74], video comple-103
tion [17], and video infilling [24]. Recently, Video-Bench [47] introduces a benchmark by collecting104
videos and annotations from multiple existing datasets. LWM [39] collects a large video and language105
dataset from public books and video datasets and trains a world model that is capable of processing106
more than millions of tokens. However, modeling millions of tokens is extremely difficult due to107
high memory cost, computational complexity, and lack of suitable datasets. Mementos [62] builds108
a benchmark for MLLM reasoning for input image sequences. STAR [ 64] builds a benchmark109
for situated reasoning in real-world videos. CLEVER [ 69] builds a benchmark containing videos110
focusing on objects with simple visual appearance. Our contribution, in contrast, presents a new video111
understanding benchmark designed to evaluate models on several pivotal components crucial for a112
comprehensive world model. These components encompass interdisciplinary coverage, task diversity,113
and multifaceted reasoning capabilities—including future prediction, counterfactual thinking, and114
more—underpinned by original human annotations and integrated domain knowledge.115
3 The MMWorld Benchmark116
The MMWorld benchmark is built on three key design principles: multi-discipline coverage and117
multi-faceted reasoning. It spans various disciplines that require domain expertise and incorporates118
diverse reasoning skills such as explanation, counterfactual thinking, and future prediction. The119
benchmark consists of two parts: a human-annotated dataset and a synthetic dataset. The human-120
annotated dataset serves as the main test bed to evaluate MLLMs from multiple perspectives. The121
synthetic dataset contains two subsets, focusing on evaluating MLLMs’ perception behavior from122
both visual signals and audio inputs, respectively.123
3.1 Manual Data Collection124
We collect videos from YouTube with the Creative Licence in seven disciplines: Art& Sports (18.5%),125
Business (12.0%), Science (20.4%), Health & Medicine (12.0%), Embodied Tasks (12.0%%), Tech126
& Engineering (12.9%), and Game (12.2%). For Art & Sports, 29 videos are collected from the127
SportsQA dataset [31]. And for Embodied Tasks, 24 videos are sourced from IKEA Assembly [7],128
RT-1 [9], and Ego4D [19] datasets to increase video diversity.129
Our manual benchmark collection takes two stages. In the first stage, we conduct a detailed examina-130
tion of each of the seven primary disciplines to identify a comprehensive range of subdisciplines for131
inclusion in our benchmark. Our selection of videos is driven by two key principles:132
The first principle, multi-discipline coverage, emphasizes the requirement for domain knowl-133
edge—selecting videos that inherently demand an understanding of specialized content across various134
disciplines. The second principle, multi-faceted annotation, involves collecting videos that enable135
the creation of question-answer pairs from multiple perspectives to evaluate world model properties136
comprehensively. The third principle, temporal information, prioritizes the inclusion of videos137
that provide meaningful content over time, as understanding temporal information is crucial for138
grasping world dynamics. This allows models to engage in temporal reasoning. Therefore, answering139
questions in our dataset requires implicit temporal reasoning, e.g., the model needs to understand140
temporal information to explain “why does the robot need to do the step shown in the video”. We141
also design a “temporal understanding” question type to explicitly test models’ ability to reason about142
temporal information (examples can be found in Section F in the Appendix).143
During the second stage, our team embark on the task of question annotation. We craft questions144
that primarily test seven aspects of multimodal video understanding also from the perspective of145
multi-faceted reasoning: 1) Explanation: Questions ask the model to elucidate the underlying logic146
or purpose within the video; 2) Counterfactual Thinking: Tests the model’s ability to hypothesize and147
consider alternative outcomes; 3) Future Prediction: Aims to predict future events based on the current148

Understanding real-world dynamics requires157
models to process both audio and visual modal-158

in these modalities, we designed an automated160
data collection pipeline. This pipeline collects161
targeted videos and generates QA pairs based on162
either audio or visual information, ensuring the163
model’s capabilities are assessed independently164
for each modality. By using a single modality’s165
information for generation, our pipeline ensures166
that the synthetic data remains unbiased regard-167
ing input modality.168
The synthetic data generation pipeline is illus-169
trated in Figure 3. We employ a systematic170
approach to gather videos with Creative Com-171
mons licenses from YouTube and the extensive172
YouTube-8M dataset [1]. This method ensures a diverse and comprehensive collection of video data,173
which is important for the robust evaluation of multimodal video understanding models.174
Video Collection and Processing We start with the video Query Generator. We start with the same175
seven disciplines as the manually collected dataset. For each discipline, a set of subdisciplines is176
defined to encapsulate a wide spectrum of topics, ensuring a diverse and comprehensive dataset. Once177
the queries are generated, the Video Mapping and Filteringstep is initiated. We perform mapping of178
videos to YouTube-8M and online videos, constrained by a strict time limit of two minutes per query,179
keeping only the most pertinent videos that satisfy the predefined criteria. Simultaneously, the works180
in conjunction with the video transcripts to extract key terms and concepts. This iterative process181
refines the search parameters and enhances the semantic richness of the dataset by identifying and182
encoding the salient themes present in the videos. The Video Summarizationmodule utilizes Query-183

focused video summarization techniques based on Katna3 and UniVTG [37]. This module selects184
ten representative frames from each video, distilling the essence of the content while preserving185
the narrative context. This summarization facilitates efficient storage and quicker processing times,186
which are crucial for large-scale analysis.187
QA Generation The final stage in our pipeline is the QA / Caption Generationmodule, where we188
leverage the capabilities of GPT-4V to generate accurate and contextually relevant questions and189
answers, as well as captions, based on the video frames and transcripts. This step not only provides190
rich annotations for each video but also equips the dataset with a multimodal dimension that supports191
various downstream tasks such as video QA, captioning, and more.192
Quality of the Synthetic Dataset Human evaluators were engaged to ascertain the reasonableness193
of automatically generated questions and answers, ensuring that the synthetic dataset maintains a194
high standard of quality and relevance. The findings from this human evaluation phase are detailed195
in Section 3 of the Appendix, offering insights into the dataset’s efficacy and the realism of its196
constructed queries and responses.197
Finally, the statistics of automated curated data, which is used for the ablation study, are shown198
in Table 2. The taxonomy of our dataset is shown in Figure 1. We note that only a portion of the199
subdisciplines are shown due to space concerns. Please refer to the Appendix for full information.200
4 Experiments201
4.1 Experimental Settings202
In our study, we compare MLLM’s performance on the MMWorld benchmark, including GPT-203
4V [51], Gemini Pro [58], Video-Chat [33], Video-LLaMA [75], ChatUnivi [27], mPLUG-Owl [68],204
Otter [30], ImageBind-LLM [23], PandaGPT [56], LWM [39], and X-Instruct-BLIP [52]. For both205
Gemini Pro and GPT-4V , we adhere to the default settings provided by their official APIs. They both206
take ten image frames extracted from the video content as the input. The Gemini Pro is set to process207
visual input and configured with safety settings to filter a range of harmful content. The configuration208
thresholds are set to ‘BLOCK_NONE’. For PandaGPT, we set ‘top_p’ to 0.7 and ‘temperature’ to209
0.5. For VideoChat, we set ‘max_frames’ to 100. For X-Instruct-BLIP, the model is implemented210
using four image frames. We use GPT-4-32K as the judge for judging whether the model answer211
is correct when it can not mapped to the option letter using the rule-based method. For others, we212
all use the default setting. All inferences are run on a NVIDIA A6000 workstation. The detailed213
implementation is given in the Appendix.214

4.2 Evaluation215
Our dataset includes multiple-choice questions and captions corresponding to each video, enabling216
tasks such as video question answering and video captioning. We focus on video question answering217
by evaluating a model’s performance based on its accuracy in selecting the correct answer from the218
provided options. One challenge lies in reliably parsing the model’s response to map it to one of the219
predefined choices. To address this, we employ two mapping strategies. We employ two mapping220
strategies. The first method employs automated scripts to parse the models’ predictions and compare221
the parsed results with the ground truth, similar to the approach used in [ 73]. The second method222
involves models freely generating answers, which are then evaluated by GPT-4. Given the question,223
correct answer, and model’s prediction, GPT-4 returns a True or False judgment. This approach is224
based on recent works in model evaluation [45; 25; 22; 42]. We validated this method with human225
evaluators, showing an error rate of 4.76% across 189 examples, confirming the effectiveness of226
GPT-4 as an evaluator. Detailed results for human evaluation and for these two different strategies227
are provided in Appendix B. In the main paper, all results are evaluated using the second approach.228
4.3 Main Evaluation Results229
We show in Table 3 the main evaluation results of different MLLMs. Among these, GPT-4V emerges230
as the top performer, closely followed by Gemini Pro. Video-LLaV A also demonstrates strong results,231
primarily due to the extensive training data which consists of 558K LAION-CCSBU image-text232
pairs and 702K video-text pairs from WebVid [6]. For instruction tuning, datasets were gathered233
from two sources: a 665K image-text instruction dataset from LLaV A v1.5 and a 100K video-text234
instruction dataset from Video-ChatGPT [45]. This superior performance may also be attributed235
to Video-LLaV A’s adoption of CLIP ViT-L/14 trained in LanguageBind [36] as its vision model236
and the inclusion of a large volume of image-video-text pairings within the training data. On the237
other hand, models like Otter and LWM perform poorly across most disciplines, possibly due to238
their weaker backbone and architecture used. Otter uses the LLaMA-7B language encoder and a239
CLIP ViT-L/14 vision encoder, both of which are frozen, with only the Perceiver resampler module240
fine-tuned, which may contribute to its lower performance. Additionally, some MLLMs perform even241
worse than random, highlighting the challenging nature of MMWorld.242

90 (b) GPT-4V results by disciplines at difficulty levels.
Figure 5: Model performance at different difficulty levels for average humans. Average human
difficulty levels are defined by 3 turkers’ performance per question: Easy (3/3 correct answers),
medium (2/3 correct), hard (1/3 correct), and expert (0/3 correct).
Closed-source models like GPT-4V and Gemini Pro perform similarly on counterfactual thinking246
and outperform all others. However, for temporal understanding, Video-LLaV A performs the best.247
This may be due to its extensive training on large amounts of video-language data, which enhances248
its spatio-temporal reasoning abilities. This can be also observed in its high scores on the Art &249
Sports and Embodied Tasks, which involve dense spatio-temporal information, as shown in Table 3.250
Video-LLaV A’s performance is comparable to GPT-4V and Gemini on explanation tasks, likely251
because of its two-stage training process and exposure to a large amount of instruction-tuning data in252
the second stage, which includes similar instructions.253
4.5 Study on MLLM Performance at Different Difficulty Levels for Average Humans254
Figure 5a indicate some correlation between the difficulty levels as perceived by humans and the255
performance of MLLMs. MLLMs generally follow a trend where accuracy decreases as the difficulty256
level increases, which aligns with human performance patterns. However, the correlation is not257
perfect, suggesting that while models and humans share some common ground in understanding258
question difficulty, there are also notable differences in their capabilities. The data reveals that259
MLLMs exhibit different skill sets compared to humans. As highlighted in Figure 5b, models like260
GPT-4V can correctly answer expert-level questions that humans often get wrong, particularly in261
disciplines such as Business and Health & Medicine, where humans often struggle, yet they sometimes262
falter on easier questions, likely due to the lack of contextual understanding. Notably, discrepancies263
in disciplines like Art & Sports and Tech & Engineering highlight areas where MLLMs’ performance264
does not align with human results, suggesting different perception, cognition, and reasoning abilities265
in handling abstract concepts. These differences suggest that MLLMs can complement human266
capabilities, offering potential for enhanced task performance by combining the data-driven insights267
of models with human intuition and contextual knowledge.268

Figure 6: The frequency of different error types across various MLLMs. For each error type, 10
examples were evaluated. Error types are abbreviated as follows: QUE (Question Understanding
Error), AUE (Audio Understanding Error), VPE (Visual Perception Error), HE (Hallucination Error),
RE (Reasoning Error), LDK (Lack of Domain Knowledge), and RA (Reject to Answer).
4.6 Study on Modality of Perception269
We conduct ablations to evaluate MLLMs ability to perceiving the world on the synthetic dataset of270
MMWorld. With our synthetic dataset, we considered scenarios where only one modality—either271
audio or visual—is available. Table 4 shows the results which evaluates the model’s ability to interpret272
spoken language, background noises, and other audio elements without the aid of visual context273
and the model’s perception ability to operate without any audio input. For the visual perception274
test, Gemini Pro performed the best, demonstrating its strong ability to process visual information.275
Interestingly, Video-Chat exhibited better audio perception than ChatUnivi, despite its poorer visual276
perception. This may be attributed to its use of the Whisper [54] speech recognition model. It also277
explains that in Table 3, Video-Chat outperforms ChatUnivi in the Art & Sports discipline, which278
requires a greater understanding of music, voice, and background audio. However, in other disciplines279
such as Science and Health & Medicine, Video-Chat’s performance is significantly poorer.280
4.7 Error Analysis281
To gain deeper insights into the limitations of MLLMs, we prompted the models to explain the282
reasoning behind their choices, particularly when errors occurred. Through this analysis, we identified283
common error patterns and summarized them into seven distinct categories. We conducted a simple284
test where the same questions that triggered errors in GPT-4V were also posed to other MLLMs.285
The frequencies of each type of error are presented in Figure 6, as annotated by human evaluators.286
Detailed qualitative examples of these errors and further analysis are provided in the Appendix.287
5 Conclusion288
Our MMWorld Benchmark represents a significant step forward in the quest for advanced multi-modal289
language models capable of understanding complex video content. By presenting a diverse array290
of videos across seven disciplines, accompanied by questions that challenge models to demonstrate291
explanation, counterfactual thinking, future prediction, and domain expertise, we have created a292
rigorous testing ground for the next generation of AI. While using LLMs for data generation can293
introduce hallucination issues, these challenges are manageable and are commonly addressed [63; 55].294
Another potential risk is the misuse of MLLMs for surveillance or privacy invasion. The ability of295
models to understand video content and perform reasoning could be exploited to monitor individuals296
without their consent, leading to serious ethical and legal concerns regarding privacy.297
