Abstract
One important challenge in evaluating the robustness of vision models is controlling1
individual nuisance factors independently. While some simple synthetic corruptions2
are commonly applied to existing models, they do not fully capture all realistic3
and relevant distribution shifts of real-world images. To overcome this challenge,4
we apply LoRA adapters to diffusion models to realize a wide range of individual5
nuisance shifts in a continuous manner. While existing generative benchmarks6
perform manipulations in one step, we argue for gradual and continuous nuisance7
shifts, as they allow evaluating the sensitivity and failure points of vision models.8
With this in mind, we perform a comprehensive large-scale study to evaluate the9
robustness and generalization of various classifiers under various nuisance shifts.10
Through carefully-designed comparisons and analysis, we reveal multiple valuable11
observations: 1) More modern and larger architectures trained on larger datasets12
tend to be more robust to various nuisance shifts and fail later for larger scales. 2)13
Pre-training strategy influences the robustness and fine-tuning a CLIP classifier14
improves the standard accuracy but deteriorates the robustness. 3) The accuracy15
drops only account for one dimension of robustness and the failure point analysis16
should be considered as an additional dimension for robustness evaluation. We17
hope our continuous nuisance shift benchmark can provide a new perspective on18
assessing the robustness of vision models.19
1 Introduction20
Machine learning models are typically validated and tested on fixed datasets under the assumption21
of independent and identically distributed samples. However, this may not fully reflect the true22
capabilities and potential vulnerabilities of models when deployed in dynamic real-world environ-23
ments. The robustness in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios is important in the real world. In24
safety-critical applications, decision-makers might be interested in how models perform under various25
specific nuisance shifts and severity levels. The term “nuisance shifts” refers to any intervention on26
a considered image distribution that alters the visual information while not changing the class of a27
considered target object, which can include the weather, style, or background.28
In the past, various benchmarks have been proposed to evaluate the robustness of computer vision29
models. One line of benchmarks manually collects data with nuisance shifts [1, 12, 17, 18, 20, 34,30
41, 45]. Yet, such approaches are not scalable and often include only a small variety of nuisance31
shifts. While Hendrycks and Dietterich [16] reports accuracy drops for various synthetic corruption32

a model’s robustness in various conditions.
types and levels of corruption, they are not always relevant in the real world and do not represent all33
real-world nuisance shifts.34
On the other hand, synthetic datasets offer opportunities for evaluating deep neural networks. They35
allow the generation of various instances of a specific object class with specified context and nuisance36
shifts. While rendering pipelines allow precise control of several variables and are applied for37
benchmarking [3, 21, 23, 35], some nuisance shifts are hard to realize using traditional pipelines, such38
as weather variations like snow. Recent development in diffusion models has enabled the application39
of generative models for training [10, 15] and benchmarking vision models [29, 30, 40, 44].40
However, all previous approaches define binary nuisance shifts by considering the existence or41
absence of that shift, which may contradict their continuous realization in real-world scenarios. For42
example, the snow level in an environment can range from light snowfall to objects fully covered43
with snow. While one model might fail at both levels, a different model might only fail when the44
object is heavily occluded. Thus, it is necessary to realize continuous shifts to evaluate the sensitivity45
of vision models and their failure points.46
To overcome this shortcoming, we apply LoRA [19] adapters to realize a continuous variation of47
given nuisance shifts, and we use them for benchmarking a variety of classifiers along the following48
axes: (i) architecture, (ii) number of parameters, and (iii) pre-training and classification paradigms.49
Our new benchmark opens the path for robustness metrics beyond ImageNet accuracy: Evaluating50
on continuous levels allows computing the accuracy drop at specified scales and the failure point51
of models under a specific shift. In contrast to previous works that conduct analysis on two levels,52
our study reveals the following findings considering multiple levels of scales: 1) More modern and53
larger architectures are more robust to various nuisance shifts. 2) If a model is trained on more data54
using a classification or a surrogate loss, it is more robust independent of the standard accuracy.55
3) Fine-tuning typically improves the standard accuracy. However, its impact on robustness varies56
depending on the considered models. 4) In addition to the accuracy drop as one measure of robustness,57
the point of failure might be a similarly important quantity to consider when the robustness with58
respect to a specific shift level is of relevance. Our results show that the two quantities are not always59
aligned and should be considered as two separate dimensions of robustness.60
One essential requirement for using synthetic images for benchmarking is to ensure that the considered61
images correspond to the class distribution. Manually checking the quality of images is still common62
practice [44]. However, this does not allow scaling the analysis. Some approaches have been63
proposed for automated filtering, but there is no standard dataset for evaluating filtering strategies.64
We manually annotate a dataset with filter labels and use it to propose a filtering mechanism for65
removing out-of-class samples.66
In summary, our work makes the following contributions: (i) We provide a framework for implement-67
ing and benchmarking vision models with respect to nuisance shifts under continuous severity levels.68
2

(ii) We collect an annotated dataset for benchmarking out-of-class filtering strategies. We propose69
a novel filtering mechanism and apply it to our generated images. (iii) We evaluate the robustness70
of a variety of classifiers along different scales with respect to nuisance shifts with multiple scales.71
(iv) We publish a dataset for benchmarking the robustness of classifiers with respect to 14 diverse72
nuisance shifts at six severity levels. We additionally provide 1400 trained LoRA sliders that can be73
used for computing shift levels in a continuous manner.74

Robustness. When referring to natural robustness, we consider the relative accuracy drop of a76
classifier with respect to interventions that alter images from a base distribution, building on the77
formalism introduced by Drenkow et al. [9]. While the robustness to generic distribution shifts is of78
interest, we consider the robustness with respect to specific nuisance shifts that can be modeled as79
causal interventions on the environment, the appearance, the object, or the renderer. We define such80
interventions in a continuous manner on a metric scale.81
Benchmarking Robustness. Early approaches for benchmarking robustness and generalizability82
of models used fixed datasets [6, 7, 24], but this lacks scalability and fails to capture the failure points83
some models could face in real-world applications since they usually measure performances under84
the assumption of independent and identically distributed samples. To address this, a first line of85
research involves manually collecting data with nuisance shifts [1, 12, 17, 18, 20, 34, 41, 45].86
However, these methods are often time-consuming and labor-intensive because they require data87
crawling and human annotations. Moreover, they usually capture only a subset of nuisance shifts that88
models may encounter in the real world and it is challenging to ensure the independence of these89
annotated nuisances. Additionally, it is possible to manually apply additional nuisances to evaluate90
their robustness in a more controlled manner, for example with image corruptions [16] or adversarial91
attacks [5, 31, 37]. The second line of research uses synthetic data for benchmarking, which offers92
the ability to generate a large and diverse range of nuisance shifts with precise control [ 3, 21, 35]93
but are limited to nuisance that can be easily modelled ( e.g., lighting, fog, occlusions). Recent94
developments in diffusion models have allowed some notable progress in the possibility of creating95
synthetic benchmark dataset [ 29, 30, 40, 44] with realistic data and more possibilities to control96
nuisances (e.g., text-guided corruptions, counterfactual). In our work, we propose a framework for97
benchmarking vision models with respect to nuisance shifts under continuous severity levels, as well98
as a novel filtering mechanism for removing out-of-class samples from synthetic data.99
3 Framework for Benchmarking100
In this section, we present our methodology to realize continuous shifts for evaluating model’s101
sensitivity with respect to such nuisance factors.102
3.1 Continuous Nuisance Shifts for Benchmarking103
For evaluating the robustness of image recognition models with respect to continuous scale nuisance104
shifts, two characteristics are desirable: (1) The severity of the considered shift can be controlled,105
allowing the estimation of the shift scale where a considered model fails. (2) Realizing a nuisance106
shift should not come along with factors of variations that might alter the class identity. The variations107
should be subtle and calibrated according to a pre-defined scale, allowing a fine-grained analysis on a108
distribution level when considering individual images.109
Methods for Realizing Continuous Shifts. A natural way to realize nuisance factors are methods110
based on text prompts [25, 29, 40]. They follow the prompt template “A picture of a {class}” and “A111
picture of a {class} in {shift}”. This, however, does not allow the gradual increase of a nuisance for112
a given image. In addition, the realized nuisance shift realized by the prompt addition “in {shift}”113
largely varies for different seeds and classes. The right figure in Fig. 3 illustrates that the nuisance114

shift as measured by the difference of the CLIP [ 33] alignments of the base image and its shifted115
version to the prompt “A picture in snow” is dispersed. A qualitative example is given in Fig. 2116
A naive approach for realizing continuous shifts involves computing the difference between two117
corresponding CLIP embeddings. We explored the naive strategy following the implementation of118
Baumann et al. [2], but we did not achieve robust nuisance shifts for a variety of classes. A different119
approach that allows realizing subtle variations involves LoRA [19] adapters. LoRA are low-rank120
matrices that can characterize the directions of nuisance shifts. Gandikota et al. [11] propose a121
strategy to learn concept sliders based on LoRA adapters to learn continuous concept variations.122
Similarly, we realize a nuisance shift by training a LoRA adapter that realizes a low-rank concept123
shift s for a specific class c: PGM(X|c + s) =PθSD (X|c) · PθLoRA (X|c, s), where samples are drawn124
from the generative model (GM) by combining the pre-trained SD model with the learned LoRA125
adapter. We apply LoRA adapters that are learned based on concepts specified by language. As126
shown in Fig. 2, applying the LoRA slider allows realizing gradual nuisance shifts. We illustrate127
the average variation of the image and the realization of the shift for the LoRA approach and the128
approach based on two prompts (2P) in Fig. 3. The variation of the images is measured using the129
cosine similarity of the DINOv2-R class tokens of the base image and the shifted images, while the130
severity of the shift is measured using the text alignment to the prompt “A picture in snow”. The131
LoRA adapter application allows gradual shifts, but the text-prompt-based application only allows132
one single scale for a given seed.133
The variation of the number of noise steps [28] with active LoRA adapters controls to what extent the134
identity and semantics are modified when increasing the LoRA scale. We do not activate the LoRA135
adapter at earlier timesteps to realize variations that do not drastically change the semantic structure136
of the image since they are constructed at earlier timestamps of the diffusion process [27].137
3.2 Accounting for the ImageNet Distribution138
We aim to evaluate a model’s robustness with respect to specific nuisance shiftss that alter the base139
ImageNet distribution p(XIN|c), which is conditioned on the 1k ImageNet classes c. For a more140
accurate estimate of the robustness with respect to a single considered shift, we desire a high model141
accuracy for the unshifted distribution. As pointed out by Vendrow et al. [40], the distribution of142
Stable Diffusion (SD) generated images p(XSD|c) differs from the ImageNet distribution, resulting143
in lower classification accuracies.Therefore, we use the textual inversions provided by Vendrow et al.144
[40] to account for the ImageNet distribution and call it IN*: p(XIN*|c) =p(X|c).145

4 The Benchmarking Dataset146
To evaluate filtering strategies for removing OOC samples, we collect a dataset. This section presents147
this dataset and the selected filtering strategy.148
Filtering of OOC Samples. Current diffusion models allow the generation of diverse and realistic149
images x ∼ p(X|z) that are consistent with a desired conditionz = [c, si] that involves the considered150
ImageNet class c ∈ N | 1 ≤ c ≤ 1000 and the variablesi ∈ R corresponding the level of a considered151
nuisance shift i. However, due to their probabilistic formulation, the generated sample might deviate152
from the the condition z. While low-likely samples are in general not necessarily desired, long-tail153
samples also occur in the real world. For benchmarking applications, we are particularly concerned154
if the generated samples deviate from the original class c, i.e., the considered class cannot be155
characterized anymore. We call such samples “out-of-class” (OOC) samples [29]. Applying a LoRA156
adapter can leave the naturally learned manifold of the diffusion model and is, therefore, more prone157
to OOC samples (see Fig. 2). Evaluating the sensitivity to specific nuisance shifts requires removing158
the OOC samples generated by the shift’s application. Therefore, we collect a dataset of generated159
images to evaluate the sliding process and strategies to automatically remove OOC samples.160
Dataset for Evaluating OOC Filtering Strategies. To select a filter for detecting OOC samples, we161
collected a dataset for manual labeling: We pursue the following strategy:(i) In the first stage, 24k162
images are generated for 20 seeds, 5 LoRA scales, and 2 shifts per class for 100 random ImageNet163
classes in total. We select two very different shifts: One shift corresponds to a natural variation164
(snow), and the second shift corresponds to a style shift (cartoon style). (ii) Since we aim to find165
OOC samples that arise due to the application of the LoRA adapters, we remove all start samples166
without any shift that are low-likelihood samples, i.e. have a low text-alignment, and that are not167
classified as the corresponding class by multiple classifiers. After removing hard starting samples, the168
labeling dataset consists of around 18k images. (iii) To reduce the labeling effort, we filter out all easy169
samples that are (1) correctly classified by DINOv2-R and (2) one out of three classifiers (ResNet-50,170
DeiT-B/16, or ViT-B/16). (3) An additional requirement such that a sample is considered easy is171
a sufficiently high text alignment. (iv) Each hard image is labeled by two human annotators. To172
increase the dataset quality, we include soft labels if the image partially includes some characteristics173
of the class. So, each annotator can choose from the labels ‘class’, ‘partial class properties’, and ‘not174
class’. An image is defined as OOC sample if at least one annotator considers the image as an OOC.175
For the remaining samples, an image is considered IC (in-class) if at least one annotator labeled the176
image a clear sample of the corresponding class. All details on the labeling strategy and the dataset177
statistics are found in Appendix A.178
OOC Filtering Strategy. A filter serves its purpose if it removes all OOC samples, corresponding to179
a high true positive rate (TPR), while not removing too many in-class samples, which corresponds180
to a low false positive rate (FPR). Instead of simply applying a CLIP threshold as in Vendrow et al.181
[40], we consider a combinatorial selection approach, which requires two out of four detectors to be182
active. (i-ii) First, we consider text alignment to ‘a picture of a {class}’ and to ‘a picture of a {class}183
in {shift}’ computed via CLIP. (iii-iv) Additionally, we consider the cosine similarity to the starting184
images using the CLIP image encoder and the class tokens of DINOv2-R.For (i) and (ii), we select185

the filtering thresholds such that 90% of the labeled OOC samples are removed. We do not require186
the detection of all OOC samples since ImageNet includes some class ambiguities. The threshold is187
selected in accordance with the highest achieved accuracies of classifiers on ImageNet [36, 42, 43].188
The selected filter reaches a TPR of 87.9% and a FPR of 12.0% with an accuracy of 88.0%, while the189
simple CLIP-based thresholding reaches a TPR of 89.9% and a FPR of 35.7% with an accuracy of190
65.1%. While being mostly effective, the filtering mechanism does not remove all OOC samples.191
Therefore, we plot the classification accuracy of DINOv2-R and ResNet-50 for the labeled and the192
filtered version in Fig. 4. These results show that the filtered dataset results in comparable accuracy193
drop as the labeled dataset for both considered shifts.194
5 Benchmark195
In this section, we discuss our benchmark. We present the evaluations on the OOD-CV dataset and196
the large scale analysis of ImageNet classifiers.197
5.1 Evaluation on OOD-CV dataset198
To measure the robustness, Zhao et al. [45, 46] introduce a benchmark dataset (OOD-CV) that199
includes out-of-distribution examples of then object categories for five different individual nuisance200
factors (e.g., weather) on real data. OOD-CV is the only real-world dataset that provides accurate201
labels of various individual nuisance shifts. However, it only provides the coarse label weather for all202
weather-related nuisances instead of fine-grained labels such as rain, snow, fog or other. Following203
a similar approach in Sec. 4, we assign the fine-grained label using CLIP similarity. We detail the204
strategy for annotating OOD-CV using CLIP similarity and provide visualizations in Appendix A. We205
evaluate classifiers on both benchmarks. Specifically, we first train different classifiers (i.e., ResNet-206
50, ViT, and DINO-v2-ViT) on the training set of the OOD-CV benchmark. We then evaluate their207
performance on the data generated using our approach. Besides, we also evaluate their performance208
on the OOD-CV benchmark for each annotated sub-nuisance independently. As shown in Fig. 5, the209
accuracy remains more or less constant with an accuracy around 95% up to a nuisance scale of 1.5.210
From 2.0, the accuracy starts dropping, with the nuisance of fog and sand having the biggest impact.211
The resulting accuracy is consistently worse or similar to the accuracy of the highest nuisance scale212
of our generated data for the corresponding nuisance. We hypothesize that the bigger drop is due to a213
major limitation of the OOD-CV benchmark dataset: the nuisances are not completely disentangled,214
and part of the accuracy drop originates from various other factors (e.g., image quality, image size,215
and noise). Another hint confirming that hypothesis is the slight accuracy increase (up to +2.5%)216
for the rain and snow nuisances when increasing the nuisance scale from 0.0 to 1.5. Given that the217
models were trained on OOD-CV benchmark training set, and evaluated on our generated data. Thus,218
when corrupting the data with snow or rain, which closely relates to noise or pixelation from zooming219
in, the data becomes closer to the training data of the OOD-CV benchmark. Hence, the OOD-CV220
benchmark does not fully disentangle the annotated nuisances. In contrast, our approach allows for221
fine-grained control of nuisances, for a more complete understanding of a model’s capability.222

5.2 Evaluated Models and Experimental Setup223
We use our benchmark to evaluate the models along the following axes:224
(i) Architecture. To compare architectures with a comparable number of parameters, we consider225
ResNet-50 [13], ViT-B/16 [8], DeiT-B/16 [38], DeiT-3-B/16 [39], and ConvNeXt-B [26]. All models226
are trained in a supervised manner.227
(ii) Model Size. For ViT, we consider the small, medium, base, large, and huge variants of DeiT-3.228
For CNN, we consider the ResNet variants, e.g., 18, 34, 50, 101, and 152.229
(iii) Paradigm and Training Data. The selection of the training paradigm and the amount of training230
data are highly coupled. Therefore, we evaluate a set of models that differ with respect to the used231
data as well as their pre-training and classification strategy. We compare two supervised models:232
One model trained on IN1k, and the other model trained on IN21k and then fine-tuned on IN1k.233
To evaluate the effect of learning strategies, we include two more models that are trained on IN1k:234
A masked autoencoder (MAE) [14] and DINOv1 [4]. Additionally, we also include a VLM-based235
classifier using a pre-trained CLIP-model [33] and DINOv2 [32]. We include the zero-shot variant of236
CLIP and a version that is fine-tuned on IN1k. All models use ViT-B/16 as the backbone. Furthermore,237
we evaluate a diffusion classifer [22] on a smaller subset.238
Implementation Details. As pointed about in Sec. 3.2, we use textual inversions to account for239
the ImageNet distribution. To evaluate the relance of this approach, we generate 200 images of 100240
randomly selected ImageNet classes using standard SD2.0 and SD2.0 with the textual inversions of241
IN*. To illustrate the distribution gap, we compute the accuracies for ResNet-50 and DeiT. They242
achieve an accuracy of 68.2% and 71.6% for the SD distribution and 74.1% and 79.1% for the IN*243
distribution, which equals an accuracy drop of 6% and 8%, respectively. We perform all the following244
experiments using the IN* distribution. We use SD2.0 and we activate the LoRA adapters for the last245
75% of noise steps. Due to the computational complexity, we perform sliding for 100 classes. To246
get an estimate of the robustness on a scale of ImageNet, we classify 1k classes using off-the-shelf247
classifiers without applying masking, as e.g., done by Hendrycks et al. [17]. We ablate in Appendix A248
how the number of classes influences the robustness evaluations.249

(c) Ratio of failure points per scale for various models and shifts: The distribution allows inferring at which
scales various models fail most often.
Figure 7: Benchmarking Classifiers and Shifts. The visualization of accuracy drop and the
distribution of failure points is provided for all shifts and the three considered axes.
Our filtering mechanism removes some samples along the sliding trajectory, i.e., some seeds only250
include images from lower scales. To account for balanced dataset, we only evaluate the models for251
seeds that still contain all scales.252
5.3 Analysis & Findings253
Following Hendrycks et al. [17], we report the accuracy drop for 5 scales and 14 diverse shifts254
as a measure of robustness in Fig. 7a and the distribution of failure points in Fig. 7b and Fig. 7c.255
We list the shifts and more evaluations in Appendix A and discuss the findings in the following.256
8

More modern architectures improve the robustness even when using the same training data: In257
our benchmark, DeiT3 achieves the highest robustness, while ConvNeXt and DeiT reach a similar258
performance. Interestingly, ResNet-152 is more robust than the standard ViT variant (Fig. 7a, Arch.).259
ConvNeXt fails later than ViT and ResNet-152: The cumulated number of failure points in Fig. 7b260
is mostly consistent with the observations of the accuracy drops. However, we identify the following261
learnings when performing the failure point evaluation: While the accuracy drop did not allow to262
clearly differentiate the performance between ViT and DeiT, the failure mode-based evaluation shows263
a significantly better performance of the ConvNeXt model (Fig. 7b, Arch.). Similarly, ConvNeXt264
fails later than ResNet-152.265
Larger models are more robust: This follows the results in Hendrycks et al. [17]. Our analysis266
shows that this behavior can be consistently reported for varying shift severities and for all considered267
nuisance factors (Fig. 7a, Model size). For this axis, the evaluation of the failure point is in line with268
the accuracy drop (Fig. 7b, Arch.).269
Using more data improves robustness: The most robust classifiers were trained on large datasets,270
such as the CLIP models on LION or DINOv2 on LVD-142M. We report a better robustness for the271
model that was pre-trained on IN21k as well (Fig. 7a, Paradigm).272
MAE is the most robust pre-training strategy: When comparing the models trained on the273
same dataset size, we observe that the fine-tuned MAE achieves the best robustness. (Fig. 7a,274
Paradigm) We use the DINOv1 model with a linear head for classification. Interestingly, it has a275
lower robustness than the ViT that was trained using a supervised loss. This might be attributed to the276
lower performance when only using linear probing. E.g., while the supervised approach (SUP-IN1k)277
showed better performance (Fig. 7a, Paradigm) than the MAE-based approach, MAE fails in average278
later than SUP-IN1k in case it fails (Fig. 7b, Paradigm).279
Some models have a larger accuracy drop but fail later. Failure points are therefore a reasonable280
additional metric to evaluate the robustness of models with respect to continuous shifts.281
Fine-tuning improves the accuracy but deteriorates the robustness for CLIP:The CLIP classifier282
applied in a zero-shot manner is more robust (Fig. 7a, Paradigm) while having a lower average283
accuracy: 89.5% vs. 84.2%. We report all accuracies in Appendix A.284
Diffusion classifiers seem not to be more robust than discriminative models. We evaluate285
the accuracy drop of the DiT-based diffusion classifier for 1k images on a subset of our dataset286
(around 400 images) for the snow and the cartoon style shift due to computational constraints. When287
comparing the performance on the same reduced dataset, the accuracy drops for the LoRA scale 2 of288
snow (cartoon) shift by around 0.12 (0.37) percent points for the diffusion classifier using the L1 loss289
computations strategy [22] and by around 0.12 (0.30) percent points for a ViT-B model trained on290
IN1k. The accuracy drops reported for the evaluated discriminative models on the subset are almost291
in line with the experiments on the labeled dataset Fig. 6. We provide more results in Appendix A.292
Failure points differ across different types of shifts: Comparing the failure point of various models293
largely differs when considering individual shifts as shown in Fig. 7c. Snow can be considered as an294
example shift that slightly changes the appearance and mainly adds a disturbance factor in the image.295
While there are some differences, the qualitative distribution is comparable for all models. On the296
contrary, the cartoon and sketch variation correspond to a style shift. Here, the failure points of less297
robust models are more concentrated.298
6 Conclusion299
This work fills the gap in generative robustness benchmarks that did not allow the application of a300
continuous shift level. In addition, we introduced the concept of failure points for benchmarking,301
providing an additional dimension to measure robustness. We applied LoRA adapters to realize fine-302
grained alterations of the image and benchmarked various classifiers along three axes. Furthermore,303
we discussed the importance of detecting out-of-class class samples when benchmarking using304
diffusion-generated images. We hope our proposed benchmark can motivate further research in the305
domain of using generated images for evaluating the natural robustness of vision models. Future306
work can improve the calibration and composition of various nuisance shifts.307

(a) Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the paper’s442
contributions and scope? [Yes] Our contributions are mentioned in the abstract, the443
introduction (summarized in lines 70-79), and they are representative of our actual444
contribution to the field.445
(b) Did you describe the limitations of your work? [Yes] We do not have a dedicated446
limitation section in our work. However, we made an utmost effort to describe in details447
(see Sec. 4) our filtering procedure to ensure that the generated data was reaching our448
quality standards. We also discuss the importance of this filtering process and provide449
an estimate of its failure rates.450
(c) Did you discuss any potential negative societal impacts of your work? [N/A] Our work451
does not have any potential negative societal impacts. In this work, we use diffusion452
models but their societal impacts have already been thoroughly discussed in papers453
introducing them.454
(d) Have you read the ethics review guidelines and ensured that your paper conforms to455
them? [Yes] After a careful review of the ethics guidelines, we believe that our paper456
conforms to them.457
