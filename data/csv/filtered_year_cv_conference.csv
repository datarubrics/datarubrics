CVPR-2021-10,CVPR,2021,Natural Adversarial Examples,"Dan Hendrycks, Kevin Zhao, Steven Basart, Jacob Steinhardt, Dawn Song","We introduce two challenging datasets that reliably cause machine learning model performance to substantially degrade. The datasets are collected with a simple adversarial filtration technique to create datasets with limited spurious cues. Our datasets' real-world, unmodified examples transfer to various unseen models reliably, demonstrating that computer vision models have shared weaknesses. The first dataset is called ImageNet-A and is like the ImageNet test set, but it is far more challenging for existing models. We also curate an adversarial out-of-distribution detection dataset called ImageNet-O, which is the first out-of-distribution detection dataset created for ImageNet models. On ImageNet-A a DenseNet-121 obtains around 2% accuracy, an accuracy drop of approximately 90%, and its out-of-distribution detection performance on ImageNet-O is near random chance levels. We find that existing data augmentation techniques hardly boost performance, and using other public training datasets provides improvements that are limited. However, we find that improvements to computer vision architectures provide a promising path towards robust models.",True,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/papers/Yang_3D-MAN_3D_Multi-Frame_Attention_Network_for_Object_Detection_CVPR_2021_paper.pdf
CVPR-2021-21,CVPR,2021,RGB-D Local Implicit Function for Depth Completion of Transparent Objects,"Luyang Zhu, Arsalan Mousavian, Yu Xiang, Hammad Mazhar, Jozef van Eenbergen, Shoubhik Debnath, Dieter Fox","Majority of the perception methods in robotics require depth information provided by RGB-D cameras. However, standard 3D sensors fail to capture depth of transparent objects due to refraction and absorption of light. In this paper, we introduce a new approach for depth completion of transparent objects from a single RGB-D image. Key to our approach is a local implicit neural representation built on ray-voxel pairs that allows our method to generalize to unseen objects and achieve fast inference speed. Based on this representation, we present a novel framework that can complete missing depth given noisy RGB-D input. We further improve the depth estimation iteratively using a self-correcting refinement model. To train the whole pipeline, we build a large scale synthetic dataset with transparent objects. Experiments demonstrate that our method performs significantly better than the current state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic and real world data. In addition, our approach improves the inference speed by a factor of 20 compared to the previous best method, ClearGrasp.

CVPR-2021-28,CVPR,2021,Unsupervised Pre-Training for Person Re-Identification,"Dengpan Fu, Dongdong Chen, Jianmin Bao, Hao Yang, Lu Yuan, Lei Zhang, Houqiang Li, Dong Chen","In this paper, we present a large scale unlabeled person re-identification (Re-ID) dataset ""LUPerson"" and make the first attempt of performing unsupervised pre-training for improving the generalization ability of the learned person Re-ID feature representation. This is to address the problem that all existing person Re-ID datasets are all of limited scale due to the costly effort required for data annotation. Previous research tries to leverage models pre-trained on ImageNet to mitigate the shortage of person Re-ID data but suffers from the large domain gap between ImageNet and person Re-ID data. LUPerson is an unlabeled dataset of 4M images of over 200K identities, which is 30xlarger than the largest existing Re-ID dataset. It also covers a much diverse range of capturing environments (e.g., camera settings, scenes, etc.). Based on this dataset, we systematically study the key factors for learning Re-ID features from two perspectives: data augmentation and contrastive loss. Unsupervised pre-training performed on this large-scale dataset effectively leads to a generic Re-ID feature that can benefit all existing person Re-ID methods. Using our pre-trained model in some basic frameworks, our methods achieve state-of-the-art results without bells and whistles on four widely used Re-ID datasets: CUHK03, Market1501, DukeMTMC, and MSMT17. Our results also show that the performance improvement is more significant on small-scale target datasets or under few-shot setting.",True,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/papers/Huang_A_Multiplexed_Network_for_End-to-End_Multilingual_OCR_CVPR_2021_paper.pdf

Recently, the benefits of formulating actions as a combination of atomic-actions have shown promise in improving action understanding with the emergence of datasets containing such annotations, allowing us to learn representations capturing this information. However, there remains a lack of studies that extend action composition and leverage multiple viewpoints and multiple modalities of data for representation learning. To promote research in this direction, we introduce Home Action Genome (HOMAGE): a multi-view action dataset with multiple modalities and view-points supplemented with hierarchical activity and atomic action labels together with dense scene composition labels. Leveraging rich multi-modal and multi-view settings, we propose Cooperative Compositional Action Understanding (CCAU), a cooperative learning framework for hierarchical action recognition that is aware of compositional action elements. CCAU shows consistent performance improvements across all modalities. Furthermore, we demonstrate the utility of co-learning compositions in few-shot action recognition by achieving 28.6% mAP with just a single sample.",True,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/papers/Zhang_ABMDRNet_Adaptive-Weighted_Bi-Directional_Modality_Difference_Reduction_Network_for_RGB-T_Semantic_CVPR_2021_paper.pdf
CVPR-2021-37,CVPR,2021,Deep Lesion Tracker: Monitoring Lesions in 4D Longitudinal Imaging Studies,"Jinzheng Cai, Youbao Tang, Ke Yan, Adam P. Harrison, Jing Xiao, Gigin Lin, Le Lu","Monitoring treatment response in longitudinal studies plays an important role in clinical practice. Accurately identifying lesions across serial imaging follow-up is the core to the monitoring procedure. Typically this incorporates both image and anatomical considerations. However, matching lesions manually is labor-intensive and time-consuming. In this work, we present deep lesion tracker (DLT), a deep learning approach that uses both appearance- and anatomical-based signals. To incorporate anatomical constraints, we propose an anatomical signal encoder, which prevents lesions being matched with visually similar but spurious regions. In addition, we present a new formulation for Siamese networks that avoids the heavy computational loads of 3D cross-correlation. To present our network with greater varieties of images, we also propose a self-supervised learning strategy to train trackers with unpaired images, overcoming barriers to data collection. To train and evaluate our tracker, we introduce and release the first lesion tracking benchmark, consisting of 3891 lesion pairs from the public DeepLesion database. The proposed method, DLT, locates lesion centers with a mean error distance of 7mm. This is 5% better than a leading registration algorithm while running 14 times faster with whole CT volumes. We demonstrate even greater improvements over detector or similarity-learning alternatives. DLT also generalizes well on an external clinical test set of 100% longitudinal studies, achieving 88% accuracy. Finally, we plug DLT into an automatic tumor monitoring workflow where it leads to an accuracy of 85% in assessing lesion treatment responses, which is only 0.46% lower than the accuracy of manual inputs.",True,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/papers/Zhang_ACRE_Abstract_Causal_REasoning_Beyond_Covariation_CVPR_2021_paper.pdf

However, similar work on domain-robust visual question answering methods is very limited. Domain adaptation for VQA differs from adaptation for object recognition due to additional complexity: VQA models handle multimodal inputs, methods contain multiple steps with diverse modules resulting in complex optimization, and answer spaces in different datasets are vastly different. To tackle these challenges, we first quantify domain shifts between popular VQA datasets, in both visual and textual space. To disentangle shifts between datasets arising from different modalities, we also construct synthetic shifts in the image and question domains separately. Second, we test the robustness of different families of VQA methods (classic two-stream, transformer, and neuro-symbolic methods) to these shifts. Third, we test the applicability of existing domain adaptation methods and devise a new one to bridge VQA domain gaps, adjusted to specific VQA models. To emulate the setting of real-world generalization, we focus on unsupervised domain adaptation and the open-ended classification task formulation.",True,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/papers/Luo_Action_Unit_Memory_Network_for_Weakly_Supervised_Temporal_Action_Localization_CVPR_2021_paper.pdf

Recent studies prefer point based or voxel based convolution for achieving high performance. However, these methods suffer from the unsatisfied efficiency or complex customized convolution, making them unsuitable for applications with real-time requirements. In this paper, we present an efficient and effective 3D object detection framework, named RangeIoUDet that uses the range image as input. Benefiting from the dense representation of the range image, RangeIoUDet is entirely constructed based on 2D convolution, making it possible to have a fast inference speed. This model learns pointwise features from the range image, which is then passed to a region proposal network for predicting 3D bounding boxes. We optimize the pointwise feature and the 3D box via the point-based IoU and box-based IoU supervision, respectively. The point-based IoU supervision is proposed to make the network better learn the implicit 3D information encoded in the range image. The 3D Hybrid GIoU loss is introduced to generate high-quality boxes while providing an accurate quality evaluation. Through the point-based IoU and the box-based IoU, RangeIoUDet outperforms all single-stage models on the KITTI dataset, while running at 45 FPS for inference.

In this paper, we propose Stereo Mixture Density Networks (SMD-Nets), a simple yet effective learning framework compatible with a wide class of 2D and 3D architectures which ameliorates both issues. Specifically, we exploit bimodal mixture densities as output representation and show that this allows for sharp and precise disparity estimates near discontinuities while explicitly modeling the aleatoric uncertainty inherent in the observations. Moreover, we formulate disparity estimation as a continuous problem in the image domain, allowing our model to query disparities at arbitrary spatial precision. We carry out comprehensive experiments on a new high-resolution and highly realistic synthetic stereo dataset, consisting of stereo pairs at 8Mpx resolution, as well as on real-world stereo datasets. Our experiments demonstrate increased depth accuracy near object boundaries and prediction of ultra high-resolution disparity maps on standard GPUs.

CVPR-2021-60,CVPR,2021,On Self-Contact and Human Pose,"Lea Muller, Ahmed A. A. Osman, Siyu Tang, Chun-Hao P. Huang, Michael J. Black","People touch their face 23 times an hour, they cross their arms and legs, put their hands on their hips, etc. While many images of people contain some form of self-contact, current 3D human pose and shape (HPS) regression methods typically fail to estimate this contact. To address this, we develop new datasets and methods that significantly improve human pose estimation with self-contact. First, we create a dataset of 3D Contact Poses (3DCP) containing SMPL-X bodies fit to 3D scans as well as poses from AMASS, which we refine to ensure good contact. Second, we leverage this to create the Mimic-The-Pose (MTP) dataset of images, collected via Amazon Mechanical Turk, containing people mimicking the 3DCP poses with self-contact. Third, we develop a novel HPS optimization method, SMPLify-XMC, that includes contact constraints and uses the known 3DCP body pose during fitting to create near ground-truth poses for MTP images. Fourth, for more image variety, we label a dataset of in-the-wild images with Discrete Self-Contact (DSC) information and use another new optimization method, SMPLify-DC, that exploits discrete contacts during pose optimization. Finally, we use our datasets during SPIN training to learn a new 3D human pose regressor, called TUCH (Towards Understanding Contact in Humans). We show that the new self-contact training data significantly improves 3D human pose estimates on withheld test data and existing datasets like 3DPW. Not only does our method improve results for self-contact poses, but it also improves accuracy for non-contact poses.

Woodford, Jian Ren, Menglei Chai, Sergey Tulyakov","We propose novel motion representations for animating articulated objects consisting of distinct parts. In a completely unsupervised manner, our method identifies object parts, tracks them in a driving video, and infers their motions by considering their principal axes. In contrast to the previous keypoint-based works, our method extracts meaningful and consistent regions, describing locations, shape, and pose. The regions correspond to semantically relevant and distinct object parts, that are more easily detected in frames of the driving video. To force decoupling of foreground from background, we model non-object related global motion with an additional affine transformation. To facilitate animation and prevent the leakage of the shape of the driving object, we disentangle shape and pose of objects in the region space. Our model can animate a variety of objects, surpassing previous methods by a large margin on existing benchmarks. We present a challenging new benchmark with high-resolution videos and show that the improvement is particularly pronounced when articulated objects are considered, reaching 96.6% user preference vs. the state of the art.",True,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/papers/Li_Adaptive_Prototype_Learning_and_Allocation_for_Few-Shot_Segmentation_CVPR_2021_paper.pdf

In our work, we investigate whether it is possible to leverage domain information from the unseen test samples themselves. We propose a domain-adaptive approach consisting of two steps: a) we first learn a discriminative domain embedding from unsupervised training examples, and b) use this domain embedding as supplementary information to build a domain-adaptive model, that takes both the input as well as its domain into account while making predictions. For unseen domains, our method simply uses few unlabelled test examples to construct the domain embedding. This enables adaptive classification on any unseen domain. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on various domain generalization benchmarks.

CVPR-2021-69,CVPR,2021,Deep Animation Video Interpolation in the Wild,"Li Siyao, Shiyu Zhao, Weijiang Yu, Wenxiu Sun, Dimitris Metaxas, Chen Change Loy, Ziwei Liu","In the animation industry, cartoon videos are usually produced at low frame rate since hand drawing of such frames is costly and time-consuming. Therefore, it is desirable to develop computational models that can automatically interpolate the in-between animation frames. However, existing video interpolation methods fail to produce satisfying results on animation data. Compared to natural videos, animation videos possess two unique characteristics that make frame interpolation difficult: 1) cartoons comprise lines and smooth color pieces. The smooth areas lack textures and make it difficult to estimate accurate motions on animation videos. 2) cartoons express stories via exaggeration. Some of the motions are non-linear and extremely large. In this work, we formally define and study the animation video interpolation problem for the first time. To address the aforementioned challenges, we propose an effective framework, AnimeInterp, with two dedicated modules in a coarse-to-fine manner. Specifically, 1) Segment-Guided Matching resolves the ""lack of textures"" challenge by exploiting global matching among color pieces that are piece-wise coherent. 2) Recurrent Flow Refinement resolves the ""non-linear and extremely large motion"" challenge by recurrent predictions using a transformer-like architecture. To facilitate comprehensive training and evaluations, we build a large-scale animation triplet dataset, ATD-12K, which comprises 12,000 triplets with rich annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art interpolation methods for animation videos.

In the absence of additional information, first-order approximations, i.e. optical flow, must be used, but this choice restricts the types of motions that can be modeled, leading to errors in highly dynamic scenarios. Event cameras are novel sensors that address this limitation by providing auxiliary visual information in the blind-time between frames. They asynchronously measure per-pixel brightness changes and do this with high temporal resolution and low latency. Event-based frame interpolation methods typically adopt a synthesis-based approach, where predicted frame residuals are directly applied to the key-frames. However, while these approaches can capture non-linear motions they suffer from ghosting and perform poorly in low-texture regions with few events. Thus, synthesis-based and flow-based approaches are complementary. In this work, we introduce Time Lens, a novel method that leverages the advantages of both. We extensively evaluate our method on three synthetic and two real benchmarks where we show an up to 5.21 dB improvement in terms of PSNR over state-of-the-art frame-based and event-based methods.

Besides, the lack of real-world deraining datasets comprising different types of rain and their corresponding rain-free ground-truth also impedes deraining algorithm development. In this paper, we aim to address real-world deraining problems from two aspects. First, we propose a complementary cascaded network architecture, namely CCN, to remove rain streaks and raindrops in a unified framework. Specifically, our CCN removes raindrops and rain streaks in a complementary fashion, i.e., raindrop removal followed by rain streak removal and vice versa, and then fuses the results via an attention based fusion module. Considering significant shape and structure differences between rain streaks and raindrops, it is difficult to manually design a sophisticated network to remove them effectively. Thus, we employ neural architecture search to adaptively find optimal architectures within our specified deraining search space. Second, we present a new real-world rain dataset, namely RainDS, to prosper the development of deraining algorithms in practical scenarios. RainDS consists of rain images in different types and their corresponding rain-free ground-truth, including rain streak only, raindrop only, and both of them.

Chan, Xintao Wang, Chen Change Loy, Ziwei Liu","Reference-based Super-Resolution (Ref-SR) has recently emerged as a promising paradigm to enhance a low-resolution (LR) input image by introducing an additional high-resolution (HR) reference image. Existing Ref-SR methods mostly rely on implicit correspondence matching to borrow HR textures from reference images to compensate for the information loss in input images. However, performing local transfer is difficult because of two gaps between input and reference images: the transformation gap (e.g. scale and rotation) and the resolution gap (e.g. HR and LR). To tackle these challenges, we propose C^ 2 -Matching in this work, which produces explicit robust matching crossing transformation and resolution. 1) For the transformation gap, we propose a contrastive correspondence network, which learns transformation-robust correspondences using augmented views of the input image. 2) For the resolution gap, we adopt a teacher-student correlation distillation, which distills knowledge from the easier HR-HR matching to guide the more ambiguous LR-HR matching. 3) Finally, we design a dynamic aggregation module to address the potential misalignment issue. In addition, to faithfully evaluate the performance of Ref-SR under a realistic setting, we contribute the Webly-Referenced SR (WR-SR) dataset, mimicking the practical usage scenario. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed C^ 2 -Matching significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods by over 1dB on the standard CUFED5 benchmark.

Whilst standard usage cases satisfy this requirement, many real-world scenarios involve unlabeled test data, rendering common model evaluation methods infeasible. We investigate this important and under-explored problem, Automatic model Evaluation (AutoEval). Specifically, given a labeled training set and a classifier, we aim to estimate the classification accuracy on unlabeled test datasets.

Using the feature statistics to represent the distribution of a sample dataset, we can train regression models (e.g., a regression neural network) to predict model performance.

Guibas","Localizing the camera in a known indoor environment is a key building block for scene mapping, robot navigation, AR, etc. Recent advances estimate the camera pose via optimization over the 2D/3D-3D correspondences established between the coordinates in 2D/3D camera space and 3D world space. Such a mapping is estimated with either a convolution neural network or a decision tree using only the static input image sequence, which makes these approaches vulnerable to dynamic indoor environments that are quite common yet challenging in the real world. To address the aforementioned issues, in this paper, we propose a novel outlier-aware neural tree which bridges the two worlds, deep learning and decision tree approaches. It builds on three important blocks: (a) a hierarchical space partition over the indoor scene to construct the decision tree; (b) a neural routing function, implemented as a deep classification network, employed for better 3D scene understanding; and (c) an outlier rejection module used to filter out dynamic points during the hierarchical routing process. Our proposed algorithm is evaluated on the RIO-10 benchmark developed for camera relocalization in dynamic indoor environments. It achieves robust neural routing through space partitions and outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches by around 30% on camera pose accuracy, while running comparably fast for evaluation.",True,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/papers/Gong_Cluster_Split_Fuse_and_Update_Meta-Learning_for_Open_Compound_Domain_CVPR_2021_paper.pdf

Enabling an all-encompassing view of street-scenes, omnidirectional cameras present themselves as a perfect fit in such systems. Most segmentation models for parsing urban environments operate on common, narrow Field of View (FoV) images. Transferring these models from the domain they were designed for to 360-degree perception, their performance drops dramatically, e.g., by an absolute 30.0% (mIoU) on established test-beds. To bridge the gap in terms of FoV and structural distribution between the imaging domains, we introduce Efficient Concurrent Attention Networks (ECANets), directly capturing the inherent long-range dependencies in omnidirectional imagery. In addition to the learned attention-based contextual priors that can stretch across 360-degree images, we upgrade model training by leveraging multi-source and omni-supervised learning, taking advantage of both: Densely labeled and unlabeled data originating from multiple datasets. To foster progress in panoramic image segmentation, we put forward and extensively evaluate models on Wild PAnoramic Semantic Segmentation (WildPASS), a dataset designed to capture diverse scenes from all around the globe. Our novel model, training regimen and multi-source prediction fusion elevate the performance (mIoU) to new state-of-the-art results on the public PASS (60.2%) and the fresh WildPASS (69.0%) benchmarks.",True,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/papers/Ma_Coarse-To-Fine_Domain_Adaptive_Semantic_Segmentation_With_Photometric_Alignment_and_Category-Center_CVPR_2021_paper.pdf

When developing computer vision models that can reason about compositional spatio-temporal events, we need benchmarks that can analyze progress and uncover shortcomings. Existing video question answering benchmarks are useful, but they often conflate multiple sources of error into one accuracy metric and have strong biases that models can exploit, making it difficult to pinpoint model weaknesses. We present Action Genome Question Answering (AGQA), a new benchmark for compositional spatio-temporal reasoning. AGQA contains 192M unbalanced question answer pairs for 9.6K videos. We also provide a balanced subset of 3.9M question answer pairs, 3 orders of magnitude larger than existing benchmarks, that minimizes bias by balancing the answer distributions and types of question structures. Although human evaluators marked 86.02% of our question-answer pairs as correct, the best model achieves only 47.74% accuracy. In addition, AGQA introduces multiple training/test splits to test for various reasoning abilities, including generalization to novel compositions, to indirect references, and to more compositional steps. Using AGQA, we evaluate modern visual reasoning systems, demonstrating that the best models barely perform better than non-visual baselines exploiting linguistic biases and that none of the existing models generalize to novel compositions unseen during training.",True,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/papers/Wang_Combinatorial_Learning_of_Graph_Edit_Distance_via_Dynamic_Embedding_CVPR_2021_paper.pdf

Gupta, Devanshu Arya, Efstratios Gavves","Rotation is among the long prevailing, yet still unresolved, hard challenges encountered in visual object tracking. The existing deep learning-based tracking algorithms use regular CNNs that are inherently translation equivariant, but not designed to tackle rotations. In this paper, we first demonstrate that in the presence of rotation instances in videos, the performance of existing trackers is severely affected. To circumvent the adverse effect of rotations, we present rotation-equivariant Siamese networks (RE-SiamNets), built through the use of group-equivariant convolutional layers comprising steerable filters. SiamNets allow estimating the change in orientation of the object in an unsupervised manner, thereby facilitating its use in relative 2D pose estimation as well. We further show that this change in orientation can be used to impose an additional motion constraint in Siamese tracking through imposing restriction on the change in orientation between two consecutive frames. For benchmarking, we present Rotation Tracking Benchmark (RTB), a dataset comprising a set of videos with rotation instances. Through experiments on two popular Siamese architectures, we show that RE-SiamNets handle the problem of rotation very well and outperform their regular counterparts. Further, RE-SiamNets can accurately estimate the relative change in pose of the target in an unsupervised fashion, namely the in-plane rotation the target has sustained with respect to the reference frame.",True,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/papers/Tennakoon_Consensus_Maximisation_Using_Influences_of_Monotone_Boolean_Functions_CVPR_2021_paper.pdf

Only one label is provided at a time, and the model has to figure out the other label if it has already learned it. This setup is more aligned with real-life scenarios, where a learner usually interacts with the same family of entities multiple times, discovers more granularity about them, while still trying not to forget previous knowledge. Moreover, this setup enables evaluating models for some important lifelong learning challenges that cannot be easily addressed under the existing setups. These challenges can be motivated by the example ""if a model was trained on the class 'bear' in one task and on 'polar bear' in another task, will it forget the concept of 'bear', will it rightfully infer that a 'polar bear' is still a 'bear'? and will it wrongfully associate the label of 'polar bear' to other breeds of 'bear'?"". We develop a standardized benchmark that enables evaluating models on the IIRC setup. We evaluate several state-of-the-art lifelong learning algorithms and highlight their strengths and limitations. For example, distillation-based methods perform relatively well but are prone to incorrectly predicting too many labels per image.

It underpinned many pre-deep seminal works on segmentation and detection, yet research has seen a rapid decline since the preferential shift to learning deep models. Of the limited attempts, most aimed at interpreting complex visual scenes using perceptual organizational rules. This has however been proven to be sub-optimal, since models were unable to effectively capture the visual complexity in real-world imagery. In this paper, we rejuvenate the study of perceptual organization, by advocating two positional changes: (i) we examine purposefully generated synthetic data, instead of complex real imagery, and (ii) we ask machines to synthesize novel perceptually-valid patterns, instead of explaining existing data. Our overall answer lies with the introduction of a novel visual challenge -- the challenge of perceptual question answering (PQA). Upon observing example perceptual question-answer pairs, the goal for PQA is to solve similar questions by generating answers entirely from scratch (see Figure 1). Our first contribution is therefore the first dataset of perceptual question-answer pairs, each generated specifically for a particular Gestalt principle. We then borrow insights from human psychology to design an agent that casts perceptual organization as a self-attention problem, where a proposed grid-to-grid mapping network directly generates answer patterns from scratch. Experiments show our agent to outperform a selection of naive and strong baselines.

Our method is based on an autoencoder that disentangles composite image into reflectance and illumination for further separate harmonization. Specifically, we harmonize reflectance through material-consistency penalty, while harmonize illumination by learning and transferring light from background to foreground, moreover, we model patch relations between foreground and background of composite images in an inharmony-free learning way, to adaptively guide our intrinsic image harmonization.

Label fidelity exceeds image resolution; this ""omniscient labeling"" is a unique feature of the dataset, and enables surprisingly precise algorithmic models to be crafted. We demonstrate methods to track building footprint construction (or demolition) over time, thereby directly assessing urbanization.

This issue is further aggravated in CSS where, at each step, old classes from previous iterations are collapsed into the background. In this paper, we propose Local POD, a multi-scale pooling distillation scheme that preserves long- and short-range spatial relationships at feature level. Furthermore, we design an entropy-based pseudo-labelling of the background w.r.t. classes predicted by the old model to deal with background shift and avoid catastrophic forgetting of the old classes.

However, this process is limited by the number of qualified inspectors and the time it takes to inspect a pipe. Automatization of this process is therefore of high interest. So far, the success of computer vision approaches for sewer defect classification has been limited when compared to the success in other fields mainly due to the lack of public datasets. To this end, in this work we present a large novel and publicly available multi-label classification dataset for image-based sewer defect classification called Sewer-ML. The Sewer-ML dataset consists of 1.3 million images annotated by professional sewer inspectors from three different utility companies across nine years.

A key question for this forecast is: how to fully utilize the historical data (e.g., retinal image) up to the current stage for future disease prediction? In this paper, we provide an answer with a novel framework, namely Disease Forecast via Progression Learning (DFPL), which exploits the irreversibility prior (i.e., cannot be reversed once diagnosed). Specifically, based on this prior, we decompose two factors that contribute to the prediction of the future disease: i) the current disease label given the data (retinal image, clinical attributes) at present and ii) the future disease label given the progression of the retinal images that from the current to the future. To model these two factors, we introduce the current and progression predictors in DFPL, respectively. In order to account for the degree of progression of the disease, we propose a temporal generative model to accurately generate the future image and compare it with the current one to get a residual image. The generative model is implemented by a recurrent neural network, in order to exploit the dependency of the historical data.

In this paper, we redefine this problem with a more realistic assumption that the query image can be arbitrary in the area of interest and the reference images are captured before the queries emerge. This assumption breaks the one-to-one retrieval setting of existing datasets as the queries and reference images are not perfectly aligned pairs, and there may be multiple reference images covering one query location.

Recent progress in this field has focused on single images, video or multi-view images as inputs. In contrast, we propose a new task: shape and pose estimation from a group of multiple images of a human subject, without constraints on subject pose, camera viewpoint or background conditions between images in the group. Our solution to this task predicts distributions over SMPL body shape and pose parameters conditioned on the input images in the group. We probabilistically combine predicted body shape distributions from each image to obtain a final multi-image shape prediction. We show that the additional body shape information present in multi-image input groups improves 3D human shape estimation metrics compared to single-image inputs on the SSP-3D dataset and a private dataset of tape-measured humans. In addition, predicting distributions over 3D bodies allows us to quantify pose prediction uncertainty, which is useful when faced with challenging input images with significant occlusion. Our method demonstrates meaningful pose uncertainty on the 3DPW dataset and is competitive with the state-of-the-art in terms of pose estimation metrics.",True,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/papers/Liu_Deep_Learning_in_Latent_Space_for_Video_Prediction_and_Compression_CVPR_2021_paper.pdf

Weakly-supervised Grounded Visual Question Answering using Capsules,"Aisha Urooj, Hilde Kuehne, Kevin Duarte, Chuang Gan, Niels Lobo, Mubarak Shah","The problem of grounding VQA tasks has seen an increased attention in the research community recently, with most attempts usually focusing on solving this task by using pretrained object detectors. However, pre-trained object detectors require bounding box annotations for detecting relevant objects in the vocabulary, which may not always be feasible for real-life large-scale applications. In this paper, we focus on a more relaxed setting: the grounding of relevant visual entities in a weakly supervised manner by training on the VQA task alone. To address this problem, we propose a visual capsule module with a query-based selection mechanism of capsule features, that allows the model to focus on relevant regions based on the textual cues about visual information in the question. We show that integrating the proposed capsule module in existing VQA systems significantly improves their performance on the weakly supervised grounding task. Overall, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on two state-of-the-art VQA systems, stacked NMN and MAC, on the CLEVR-Answers benchmark, our new evaluation set based on CLEVR scenes with ground truth bounding boxes for objects that are relevant for the correct answer, as well as on GQA, a real world VQA dataset with compositional questions.

However, they contain perspective distortions, especially noticeable when capturing group portrait photos, where the background is skewed and faces are stretched. This paper introduces the first deep learning based approach to remove such artifacts from freely-shot photos. Specifically, given a wide-angle portrait as input, we build a cascaded network consisting of a LineNet, a ShapeNet, and a transition module (TM), which corrects perspective distortions on the background, adapts to the stereographic projection on facial regions, and achieves smooth transitions between these two projections, accordingly. To train our network, we build the first perspective portrait dataset with a large diversity in identities, scenes and camera modules. For the quantitative evaluation, we introduce two novel metrics, line consistency and face congruence.

Kim","Single-shot monocular birefractive stereo methods have been used for estimating sparse depth from double refraction over edges. They also obtain an ordinary-ray (o-ray) image concurrently or subsequently through additional post-processing of depth densification and deconvolution. However, when an extraordinary-ray (e-ray) image is restored to acquire stereo images, the existing methods suffer from very severe restoration artifacts in stereo images due to a low signal-to-noise ratio of input e-ray image or depth/deconvolution errors. In this work, we present a novel stereo image restoration network that can restore stereo images directly from a double-refraction image. First, we built a physically faithful birefractive stereo imaging dataset by simulating the double refraction phenomenon with existing RGB-D datasets. Second, we formulated a joint stereo restoration problem that accounts for not only geometric relation between o-/e-ray images but also joint optimization of restoring both stereo images. We trained our model with our birefractive image dataset in an end-to-end manner. Our model restores high-quality stereo images directly from double refraction in real-time, enabling high-quality stereo video using a monocular camera. Our method also allows us to estimate dense depth maps from stereo images using a conventional stereo method.

These two tasks aim at reading and understanding scene text in images for question answering and image caption generation, respectively. In contrast to the conventional vision-language pre-training that fails to capture scene text and its relationship with the visual and text modalities, TAP explicitly incorporates scene text (generated from OCR engines) in pre-training. With three pre-training tasks, including masked language modeling (MLM), image-text (contrastive) matching (ITM), and relative (spatial) position prediction (RPP), TAP effectively helps the model learn a better aligned representation among the three modalities: text word, visual object, and scene text. Due to this aligned representation learning, even pre-trained on the same downstream task dataset, TAP already boosts the absolute accuracy on the TextVQA dataset by +5.4%, compared with a non-TAP baseline. To further improve the performance, we build a large-scale dataset based on the Conceptual Caption dataset, named OCR-CC, which contains 1.4 million scene text-related image-text pairs. Pre-trained on this OCR-CC dataset, our approach outperforms the state of the art by large margins on multiple tasks, i.e., +8.3% accuracy on TextVQA, +8.6% accuracy on ST-VQA, and +10.2 CIDEr score on TextCaps.",True,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/papers/Nguyen_Dictionary-Guided_Scene_Text_Recognition_CVPR_2021_paper.pdf

Existing self-training based UDA approaches assign pseudo labels for target data and treat them as ground truth labels to fully leverage unlabeled target data for model adaptation. However, the generated pseudo labels from the model optimized on the source domain inevitably contain noise due to the domain gap. To tackle this issue, we advance a MetaCorrection framework, where a Domain-aware Meta-learning strategy is devised to benefit Loss Correction (DMLC) for UDA semantic segmentation. In particular, we model the noise distribution of pseudo labels in target domain by introducing a noise transition matrix (NTM) and construct meta data set with domain-invariant source data to guide the estimation of NTM. Through the risk minimization on the meta data set, the optimized NTM thus can correct the noisy issues in pseudo labels and enhance the generalization ability of the model on the target data. Considering the capacity gap between shallow and deep features, we further employ the proposed DMLC strategy to provide matched and compatible supervision signals for different level features, thereby ensuring deep adaptation.

While the input image can be of a smiling person or taken in extreme lighting conditions, our method can reliably produce a high-quality textured model of a person's face in neutral expression and skin textures under diffuse lighting condition. Cutting-edge 3D face reconstruction methods use non-linear morphable face models combined with GAN-based decoders to capture the likeness and details of a person but fail to produce neutral head models with unshaded albedo textures which is critical for creating relightable and animation-friendly avatars for integration in virtual environments. The key challenges for existing methods to work is the lack of training and ground truth data containing normalized 3D faces. We propose a two-stage approach to address this problem. First, we adopt a highly robust normalized 3D face generator by embedding a non-linear morphable face model into a StyleGAN2 network. This allows us to generate detailed but normalized facial assets. This inference is then followed by a perceptual refinement step that uses the generated assets as regularization to cope with the limited available training samples of normalized faces. We further introduce a Normalized Face Dataset, which consists of a combination photogrammetry scans, carefully selected photographs, and generated fake people with neutral expressions in diffuse lighting conditions. While our prepared dataset contains two orders of magnitude less subjects than cutting edge GAN-based 3D facial reconstruction methods, we show that it is possible to produce high-quality normalized face models for very challenging unconstrained input images, and demonstrate superior performance to the current state-of-the-art.",True,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/papers/Neverova_Discovering_Relationships_Between_Object_Categories_via_Universal_Canonical_Maps_CVPR_2021_paper.pdf

Specifically, we propose to map line correspondences into vectors tangent to sphere. We use these vectors to encode both angular and positional variations of image lines, which is more reliable and concise than directly using inclinations, midpoints or endpoints of image lines. Neighboring vectors mapped from correct matches exhibit a spatial regularity called local trend consistency, regardless of the type of scenes. To encode this regularity, we design a neural network and also propose a novel loss function that enforces the smoothness constraint of vector field.

It is a challenging problem due to the substantial geometry shift from simulated to real data, such that most existing 3D models underperform due to overfitting the complete geometries in the source domain.

Our dataset was collected by a flying UAV in multiple urban and rural districts in both daytime and nighttime over three months, hence covering extensive diversities w.r.t subjects, backgrounds, illuminations, weathers, occlusions, camera motions, and UAV flying attitudes. Such a comprehensive and challenging benchmark shall be able to promote the research of UAV-based human behavior understanding, including action recognition, pose estimation, re-identification, and attribute recognition.

The interactions between vehicle and pedestrian or bicyclist have a significant impact on the trajectories of traffic participants e.g. stopping or turning to avoid collisions. Although recent datasets and trajectory prediction approaches have fostered the development of autonomous vehicles yet the amount of vehicle-pedestrian (bicyclist) interactions modeled are sparse. In this work, we propose Euro-PVI, a dataset of pedestrian and bicyclist trajectories. In particular, our dataset caters more diverse and complex interactions in dense urban scenarios compared to the existing datasets. To address the challenges in predicting future trajectories with dense interactions, we develop a joint inference model that learns an expressive multi-modal shared latent space across agents in the urban scene. This enables our Joint-b-cVAE approach to better model the distribution of future trajectories.

Our dataset aims to perform Video Scene Parsing in the Wild (VSPW), which covers a wide range of real-world scenarios and categories. To be specific, our VSPW is featured from the following aspects: 1) Well-trimmed long-temporal clips. Each video contains a complete shot, lasting around 5 seconds on average. 2) Dense annotation. The pixel-level annotations are provided at a high frame rate of 15 f/s. 3) High resolution. Over 96% of the captured videos are with high spatial resolutions from 720P to 4K.

To the best of our knowledge, our VSPW is the first attempt to tackle the challenging video scene parsing task in the wild by considering diverse scenarios. Based on VSPW, we design a generic Temporal Context Blending (TCB) network, which can effectively harness long-range contextual information from the past frames to help segment the current one. Extensive experiments show that our TCB network improves both the segmentation performance and temporal stability comparing with image-/video-based state-of-the-art methods.

In metrology, the dynamic range is a basic quality of a metric tool, indicating its flexibility to accommodate various scales. Larger dynamic range offers higher flexibility. We argue that such flexibility is also important for deep metric learning, because different visual concepts indeed correspond to different semantic scales. Introducing the dynamic range to deep metric learning, we get a novel computer vision task, i.e., the Dynamic Metric Learning. Dynamic Metric Learning aims to learn a scalable metric space to accommodate visual concepts across multiple semantic scales. Based on three different types of images, i.e., vehicle, animal and online products, we construct three datasets for Dynamic Metric Learning. We benchmark these datasets with popular deep metric learning methods and find Dynamic Metric Learning to be very challenging. The major difficulty lies in a conflict between different scales: the discriminative ability under a small scale usually compromises the discriminative ability under a large one, and vice versa.

However, reconstructing a 3D caricature from a 2D caricature image remains a challenging task, mostly due to the lack of data. We propose to fill this gap by introducing 3DCaricShop, the first large-scale 3D caricature dataset that contains 2000 high-quality diversified 3D caricatures manually crafted by professional artists. 3DCaricShop also provides rich annotations including a paired 2D caricature image, camera parameters, and 3D facial landmarks. To demonstrate the advantage of 3DCaricShop, we present a novel baseline approach for single-view 3D caricature reconstruction. To ensure a faithful reconstruction with plausible face deformations, we propose to connect the good ends of the detail-rich implicit functions and the parametric mesh representations. In particular, we first register a template mesh to the output of the implicit generator and iteratively project the registration result onto a pre-trained PCA space to resolve artifacts and self-intersections. To deal with the large deformation during non-rigid registration, we propose a novel view-collaborative graph convolution network (VC-GCN) to extract key points from the implicit mesh for accurate alignment. Our method is able to generate high-fidelity 3D caricature in a pre-defined mesh topology that is animation-ready.

Existing point cloud completion methods tend to generate global shape skeletons and hence lack fine local details. Furthermore, they mostly learn a deterministic partial-to-complete mapping, but overlook structural relations in man-made objects. To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes a variational framework, Variational Relational point Completion network (VRCNet) with two appealing properties: 1) Probabilistic Modeling. In particular, we propose a dual-path architecture to enable principled probabilistic modeling across partial and complete clouds. One path consumes complete point clouds for reconstruction by learning a point VAE. The other path generates complete shapes for partial point clouds, whose embedded distribution is guided by distribution obtained from the reconstruction path during training. 2) Relational Enhancement. Specifically, we carefully design point self-attention kernel and point selective kernel module to exploit relational point features, which refines local shape details conditioned on the coarse completion. In addition, we contribute a multi-view partial point cloud dataset (MVP dataset) containing over 100,000 high-quality scans, which renders partial 3D shapes from 26 uniformly distributed camera poses for each 3D CAD model.

Thus, existing methods relying on lidar or camera experience significant performance degradation in rare but critical adverse weather conditions. To remedy this, we resort to exploiting complementary radar, which is less impacted by adverse weather and becomes prevalent on vehicles. In this paper, we present Multimodal Vehicle Detection Network (MVDNet), a two-stage deep fusion detector, which first generates proposals from two sensors and then fuses region-wise features between multimodal sensor streams to improve final detection results.

Existing datasets take one of two approaches. Large-scale video datasets contain many action labels but do not contain ground-truth 3D human motion. Alternatively, motion-capture (mocap) datasets have precise body motions but are limited to a small number of actions. To address this, we present BABEL, a large dataset with language labels describing the actions being performed in mocap sequences. BABEL consists of language labels for over 43 hours of mocap sequences from AMASS, containing over 250 unique actions. Each action label in BABEL is precisely aligned with the duration of the corresponding action in the mocap sequence. BABEL also allows overlap of multiple actions, that may each span different durations. This results in a total of over 66000 action segments.

We provide a comprehensive analysis of feature extractors trained with and without supervision on ImageNet and iNat2021, shedding light on the strengths and weaknesses of different learned features across a diverse set of tasks.

Different from existing public datasets, iMiGUE focuses on nonverbal body gestures without using any identity information, while the predominant researches of emotion analysis concern sensitive biometric data, like face and speech. Most importantly, iMiGUE focuses on micro-gestures, i,e., unintentional behaviors driven by inner feelings, which are different from ordinary scope of gestures from other gesture datasets which are mostly intentionally performed for illustrative purposes. Furthermore, iMiGUE is designed to evaluate the ability of models to analyze the emotional states by integrating information of recognized micro-gesture, rather than just recognizing prototypes in the sequences separately (or isolatedly). This is because the real need for emotion AI is to understand the emotional states behind gestures in a holistic way. Moreover, to counter for the challenge of imbalanced samples distribution of this dataset, an unsupervised learning method is proposed to capture latent representations from the micro-gesture sequences themselves. We systematically investigate representative methods on this dataset, and comprehensive experimental results reveal several interesting insights from the iMiGUE, e,g., micro-gesture-based analysis can promote emotion understanding. We confirm that the new iMiGUE dataset could advance studies of micro-gesture and emotion AI.",True,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/papers/Li_Involution_Inverting_the_Inherence_of_Convolution_for_Visual_Recognition_CVPR_2021_paper.pdf

Recent studies have shown that many samples contain multiple classes, despite being assumed to be a single-label benchmark. They have thus proposed to turn ImageNet evaluation into a multi-label task, with exhaustive multi-label annotations per image. However, they have not fixed the training set, presumably because of a formidable annotation cost. We argue that the mismatch between single-label annotations and effectively multi-label images is equally, if not more, problematic in the training setup, where random crops are applied. With the single-label annotations, a random crop of an image may contain an entirely different object from the ground truth, introducing noisy or even incorrect supervision during training. We thus re-label the ImageNet training set with multi-labels. We address the annotation cost barrier by letting a strong image classifier, trained on an extra source of data, generate the multi-labels. We utilize the pixel-wise multi-label predictions before the final pooling layer, in order to exploit the additional location-specific supervision signals. Training on the re-labeled samples results in improved model performances across the board. ResNet-50 attains the top-1 accuracy of 78.9% on ImageNet with our localized multi-labels, which can be further boosted to 80.2% with the CutMix regularization. We show that the models trained with localized multi-labels also outperform the baselines on transfer learning to object detection and instance segmentation tasks, and various robustness benchmarks.

The manipulation procedure is fully automatic, controlled by a domain-adversarial quality assessment network, making our dataset highly scalable with low human cost. In addition, we propose a novel algorithm to tackle the task of multi-person face forgery detection. Supervised by only video-level label, the algorithm explores multiple instance learning and learns to automatically attend to tampered faces.

To this end, we propose an effective divide-and-conquer strategy that divides pixels based on their plane orientation estimation; then, the succeeding instance segmentation module conquers the task of planes clustering more easily in each plane orientation group. Besides, parameters of V-planes depend on camera yaw rotation, but translation-invariant CNNs are less aware of the yaw change. We thus propose a yaw-invariant V-planar reparameterization for CNNs to learn. We create a benchmark for indoor panorama planar reconstruction by extending existing 360 depth datasets with ground truth H&V-planes (referred to as ""PanoH&V"" dataset) and adopt state-of-the-art planar reconstruction methods to predict H&V-planes as our baselines.

In contrast to previous works that directly generate object proposals for grounding in the 3D scenes, we propose a bottom-up approach to gradually aggregate content-aware information, effectively addressing the challenge posed by the partial geometry. Our approach first fuses the language and the visual features at the bottom level to generate a heatmap that coarsely localizes the relevant regions in the RGBD image. Then our approach conducts an adaptive feature learning based on the heatmap and performs the object-level matching with another visio-linguistic fusion to finally ground the referred object.

This key advantage, along with the increasing popularity of burst photography, have made MFSR an important problem for real-world applications. We propose a novel architecture for the burst super-resolution task. Our network takes multiple noisy RAW images as input, and generates a denoised, super-resolved RGB image as output.

A key observation is that ToF depth estimates do not report the true depth of the mirror surface, but instead return the total length of the reflected light paths, thereby creating obvious depth discontinuities at the mirror boundaries. To exploit depth information in mirror segmentation, we first construct a large-scale RGB-D mirror segmentation dataset, which we subsequently employ to train a novel depth-aware mirror segmentation framework. Our mirror segmentation framework first locates the mirrors based on color and depth discontinuities and correlations. Next, our model further refines the mirror boundaries through contextual contrast taking into account both color and depth information.

However, the current multi-view paradigm trains and tests on the same single scene and camera-views, which limits its practical application. In this paper, we propose a cross-view cross-scene (CVCS) multi-view crowd counting paradigm, where the training and testing occur on different scenes with arbitrary camera layouts. To dynamically handle the challenge of optimal view fusion under scene and camera layout change and non-correspondence noise due to camera calibration errors or erroneous features, we propose a CVCS model that attentively selects and fuses multiple views together using camera layout geometry, and a noise view regularization method to train the model to handle non-correspondence errors. We also generate a large synthetic multi-camera crowd counting dataset with a large number of scenes and camera views to capture many possible variations, which avoids the difficulty of collecting and annotating such a large real dataset.

This approach deviates from real-world problems in which human-only describes what the object and its surrounding look like and asks the robot to start navigation from anywhere. Accordingly, in this paper, we introduce a Scenario Oriented Object Navigation (SOON) task. In this task, an agent is required to navigate from an arbitrary position in a 3D embodied environment to localize a target following a scene description.

This embedding space contains an order of magnitude more points (i.e., images) than previous efforts based on human judgments. We were able to scale to the full 50,000 image ILSVRC validation set through a selective sampling process that used variational Bayesian inference and model ensembles to sample aspects of the embedding space that were most uncertain. To demonstrate the utility of ImageNet-HSJ, we used the similarity ratings and the embedding space to evaluate how well several popular models conform to human similarity judgments. One finding is that more complex models that perform better on task-specific benchmarks do not better conform to human semantic judgments.

These ""visual"" explanations are often insufficient, as the model's actual concept remains elusive. Moreover, without insights into the model's semantic concept, it is difficult --if not impossible-- to intervene on the model's behavior via its explanations, called Explanatory Interactive Learning. Consequently, we propose to intervene on a Neuro-Symbolic scene representation, which allows one to revise the model on the semantic level, e.g. ""never focus on the color to make your decision"". We compiled a novel con-founded visual scene data set, the CLEVR-Hans data set,capturing complex compositions of different objects. The results of our experiments on CLEVR-Hans demonstrate that our semantic explanations, i.e. compositional explanations at a per-object level, can identify confounders that are not identifiable using ""visual"" explanations only. More importantly, feedback on this semantic level makes it possible to revise the model from focusing on these factors.",True,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/papers/Tang_Mutual_CRF-GNN_for_Few-Shot_Learning_CVPR_2021_paper.pdf
CVPR-2021-959,CVPR,2021,When Age-Invariant Face Recognition Meets Face Age Synthesis: A Multi-Task Learning Framework,"Zhizhong Huang, Junping Zhang, Hongming Shan","To minimize the effects of age variation in face recognition, previous work either extracts identity-related discriminative features by minimizing the correlation between identity- and age-related features, called age-invariant face recognition (AIFR), or removes age variation by transforming the faces of different age groups into the same age group, called face age synthesis (FAS); however, the former lacks visual results for model interpretation while the latter suffers from artifacts compromising downstream recognition. Therefore, this paper proposes a unified, multi-task framework to jointly handle these two tasks, termed MTLFace, which can learn age-invariant identity-related representation while achieving pleasing face synthesis. Specifically, we first decompose the mixed face features into two uncorrelated components---identity- and age-related features---through an attention mechanism, and then decorrelate these two components using multi-task training and continuous domain adaption. In contrast to the conventional one-hot encoding that achieves group-level FAS, we propose a novel identity conditional module to achieve identity-level FAS, with a weight-sharing strategy to improve the age smoothness of synthesized faces. In addition, we collect and release a large cross-age face dataset with age and gender annotations to advance AIFR and FAS. Extensive experiments on five benchmark cross-age datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed MTLFace over state-of-the-art methods for AIFR and FAS. We further validate MTLFace on two popular general face recognition datasets, showing competitive performance for face recognition in the wild.

Unfortunately, most existing deep dehazing models have high computational complexity, which hinders their application to high-resolution images, especially for UHD (ultra-high-definition) or 4K resolution images. To address the problem, we propose a novel network capable of real-time dehazing of 4K images on a single GPU, which consists of three deep CNNs. The first CNN extracts haze-relevant features at a reduced resolution of the hazy input and then fits locally-affine models in the bilateral space. Another CNN is used to learn multiple full-resolution guidance maps corresponding to the learned bilateral model. As a result, the feature maps with high-frequency can be reconstructed by multi-guided bilateral upsampling. Finally, the third CNN fuses the high-quality feature maps into a dehazed image. In addition, we create a large-scale 4K image dehazing dataset to support the training and testing of compared models.

Here, we attempt object classification from EEG using an array of methods that are representative of the state-of-the-art, with a far larger (20x) dataset of randomized EEG trials, 1,000 stimulus presentations of each of forty classes, all from a single subject. To our knowledge, this is the largest such EEG data-collection effort from a single subject and is at the bounds of feasibility. We obtain classification accuracy that is marginally above chance and above chance in a statistically significant fashion, and further assess how accuracy depends on the classifier used, the amount of training data used, and the number of classes.

Yet their performance pales in comparison to a transfer learning baseline, an alternative approach for learning from a few examples. Furthermore, in the transfer setting, while existing SSL methods provide improvements, the presence of out-of-class is often detrimental.

Specifically, we design a Sparse Voxel Completion Network (SVCN) to complete the 3D surfaces of a sparse point cloud. Unlike semantic labels, to obtain training pairs for SVCN requires no manual labeling. We also introduce local adversarial learning to model the surface prior. The recovered 3D surfaces serve as a canonical domain, from which semantic labels can transfer across different LiDAR sensors.

In this paper, we make contributions to boost the study of GMOT in three aspects. First, we construct the first publicly available dense GMOT dataset, dubbed GMOT-40, which contains 40 carefully annotated sequences evenly distributed among 10 object categories. In addition, two tracking protocols are adopted to evaluate different characteristics of tracking algorithms.

However, the representation learning will be ill-posed if the views are highly sparse. To solve this ill-posed problem, our key idea is to integrate observations over video frames. To this end, we propose Neural Body, a new human body representation which assumes that the learned neural representations at different frames share the same set of latent codes anchored to a deformable mesh, so that the observations across frames can be naturally integrated. The deformable mesh also provides geometric guidance for the network to learn 3D representations more efficiently.

Different from the conventional digital cameras that compact the photoelectric information within the exposure interval into a single snapshot, the spike camera produces a continuous spike stream to record the dynamic light intensity variation process. For spike cameras, image reconstruction remains an important and challenging issue. To this end, this paper develops a spike-to-image neural network (Spk2ImgNet) to reconstruct the dynamic scene from the continuous spike stream. In particular, to handle the challenges brought by both noise and high-speed motion, we propose a hierarchical architecture to exploit the temporal correlation of the spike stream progressively. Firstly, a spatially adaptive light inference subnet is proposed to exploit the local temporal correlation, producing basic light intensity estimates of different moments. Then, a pyramid deformable alignment is utilized to align the intermediate features such that the feature fusion module can exploit the long-term temporal correlation, while avoiding undesired motion blur.

This paper proposes the first Megapixel level method for one shot Face Swapping (or MegaFS for short). Firstly, MegaFS organizes face representation hierarchically by the proposed Hierarchical Representation Face Encoder (HieRFE) in an extended latent space to maintain more facial details, rather than compressed representation in previous face swapping methods. Secondly, a carefully designed Face Transfer Module (FTM) is proposed to transfer the identity from a source image to the target by a non-linear trajectory without explicit feature disentanglement. Finally, the swapped faces can be synthesized by StyleGAN2 with the benefits of its training stability and powerful generative capability. Each part of MegaFS can be trained separately so the requirement of our model for GPU memory can be satisfied for megapixel face swapping. In summary, complete face representation, stable training, and limited memory usage are the three novel contributions to the success of our method.

In this paper, we claim that the standard evaluation metric, which consists in measuring the overall in-domain accuracy, is misleading. Since questions and concepts are unbalanced, this tends to favor models which exploit subtle training set statistics. Alternatively, naively introducing artificial distribution shifts between train and test splits is also not completely satisfying. First, the shifts do not reflect real-world tendencies, resulting in unsuitable models; second, since the shifts are handcrafted, trained models are specifically designed for this particular setting, and do not generalize to other configurations. We propose the GQA-OOD benchmark designed to overcome these concerns: we measure and compare accuracy over both rare and frequent question-answer pairs, and argue that the former is better suited to the evaluation of reasoning abilities, which we experimentally validate with models trained to more or less exploit biases. In a large-scale study involving 7 VQA models and 3 bias reduction techniques, we also experimentally demonstrate that these models fail to address questions involving infrequent concepts and provide recommendations for future directions of research.",True,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/papers/Wang_PointAugmenting_Cross-Modal_Augmentation_for_3D_Object_Detection_CVPR_2021_paper.pdf

This is challenging because the same state can for example alter the visual appearance of a dog drastically differently from a car. As a solution, we propose a novel graph formulation called Compositional Graph Embedding (CGE) that learns image features, compositional classifiers, and latent representations of visual primitives in an end-to-end manner. The key to our approach is exploit-ing the dependency between states, objects, and their compositions within a graph structure to enforce the relevant knowledge transfer from seen to unseen compositions. By learning a joint compatibility that encodes semantics between concepts, our model allows for generalization to un-seen compositions without relying on an external knowledgebase like WordNet. We show that in the challenging generalized compositional zero-shot setting our CGE significantly outperforms the state of the art on MIT-States and UT-Zappos.

Their existence can however pose a serious problem to computer vision tasks. Recently, a method is proposed to detect glass surfaces by learning multi-scale contextual information. However, as it is only based on a general context integration operation and does not consider any specific glass surface properties, it gets confused when the images contain objects that are similar to glass surfaces and degenerates in challenging scenes with insufficient contexts. We observe that humans often rely on identifying reflections in order to sense the existence of glass and on locating the boundary in order to determine the extent of the glass. Hence, we propose a model for glass surface detection, which consists of two novel modules: (1) a rich context aggregation module (RCAM) to extract multi-scale boundary features from rich context features for locating glass surface boundaries of different sizes and shapes, and (2) a reflection-based refinement module (RRM) to detect reflection and then incorporate it so as to differentiate glass regions from non-glass regions. In addition, we also propose a challenging dataset consisting of 4,012 glass images with annotations for glass surface detection.

Common camouflage include background matching, imitating the color and pattern of the environment, and disruptive coloration, disguising body outlines. Camouflaged object detection (COD) aims to segment camouflaged objects hiding in their surroundings. Existing COD models are built upon binary ground truth to segment the camouflaged objects without illustrating the level of camouflage.

However, lack of proper evaluation measures makes it difficult to compare approaches, hampering progress in the field. Traditional measures, such as PSNR or SSIM, are known to poorly correlate with the human perception of image quality. Therefore, in existing works common practice is also to report Mean-Opinion-Score (MOS) -- the results of human evaluation of super-resolved images. Unfortunately, the MOS values from different papers are not directly comparable, due to the varying number of raters, their subjectivity, etc. By this paper, we introduce Neural Side-By-Side -- a new measure that allows super-resolution models to be compared automatically, effectively approximating human preferences. Namely, we collect a large dataset of aligned image pairs, which were produced by different super-resolution models. Then each pair is annotated by several raters, who were instructed to choose a more visually appealing image. Given the dataset and the labels, we trained a CNN model that obtains a pair of images and for each image predicts a probability of being more preferable than its counterpart.

Our technique is based on background matting, where an additional frame of the background is captured and used to inform the alpha matte and the foreground layer. The main challenge is to compute a high-quality alpha matte, preserving strand-level hair details, while processing high-resolution images in real-time. To achieve this goal, we employ two neural networks; the base network computes a low-resolution result which is refined by a second network operating at high-resolution on selective patches. We introduce two large-scale video and image matting datasets: VideoMatte240K and PhotoMatte13K/85.

A critical question remains unanswered: ""can backdoor attacks succeed using physical objects as triggers, making them a credible threat against deep learning systems in the real world?"" We conduct a detailed empirical study to explore this question for facial recognition, a critical deep learning task. Using 7 physical objects as triggers, we collect a custom dataset of 3205 images of 10 volunteers and use it to study the feasibility of ""physical"" backdoor attacks under a variety of real-world conditions. Our study reveals two key findings. First, physical backdoor attacks can be highly successful if they are carefully configured to overcome the constraints imposed by physical objects. In particular, the placement of successful triggers is largely constrained by the victim model's dependence on key facial features. Second, four of today's state-of-the-art defenses against (digital) backdoors are ineffective against physical backdoors, because the use of physical objects breaks core assumptions used to construct these defenses.

The motivation comes from the fact that most existing visual reasoning tasks, such as CLEVR in VQA, are solely defined to test how well the machine understands the concepts and relations within static settings, like one image. We argue that this kind of state driven visual reasoning approach has limitations in reflecting whether the machine has the ability to infer the dynamics between different states, which has been shown as important as state-level reasoning for human cognition in Piaget's theory. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel transformation driven visual reasoning task. Given both the initial and final states, the target is to infer the corresponding single-step or multi-step transformation, represented as a triplet (object, attribute, value) or a sequence of triplets, respectively. Following this definition, a new dataset namely TRANCE is constructed on the basis of CLEVR, including three levels of settings, i.e. Basic (single-step transformation), Event (multi-step transformation), and View (multi-step transformation with variant views). Experimental results show that the state-of-the-art visual reasoning models perform well on Basic, but are still far from human-level intelligence on Event and View.

Both under- and overexposure greatly reduce the contrast and visual appeal of an image. Prior work mainly focuses on underexposed images or general image enhancement. In contrast, our proposed method targets both over- and under-exposure errors in photographs.

Different from existing approaches which fix kernels after training, the kernels in dynamic head are generated adaptively by the controller, conditioned on both input image and assigned task. Thus, DoDNet is able to segment multiple organs and tumors, as done by multiple networks or a multi-head network, in a much efficient and flexible manner. We created a large-scale partially labeled dataset called MOTS and demonstrated the superior performance of our DoDNet over other competitors on seven organ and tumor segmentation tasks. We also transferred the weights pre-trained on MOTS to a downstream multi-organ segmentation task and achieved state-of-the-art performance. This study provides a general 3D medical image segmentation model that has been pre-trained on a large-scale partially labeled dataset and can be extended (after fine-tuning) to downstream volumetric medical data segmentation tasks.

Using this additional information, the y-axes of the cameras can be aligned, reducing their relative orientation to a single degree-of-freedom. With this assumption, we propose a novel globally optimal solver, minimizing the algebraic error in the least squares sense, to estimate the relative pose in the over-determined case. Based on the epipolar constraint, we convert the optimization problem into solving two polynomials with only two unknowns. Also, a fast solver is proposed using the first-order approximation of the rotation. The proposed solvers are compared with the state-of-the-art ones on four real-world datasets with approx. 50000 image pairs in total.

In contrast to most existing annotation datasets in computer vision, we focus on the affective experience triggered by visual artworks and ask the annotators to indicate the dominant emotion they feel for a given image and, crucially, to also provide a grounded verbal explanation for their emotion choice. As we demonstrate below, this leads to a rich set of signals for both the objective content and the affective impact of an image, creating associations with abstract concepts (e.g., ""freedom"" or ""love""), or references that go beyond what is directly visible, including visual similes and metaphors, or subjective references to personal experiences.

While existing NAS methods mostly design architectures on a single task, algorithms that look beyond single-task search are surging to pursue a more efficient and universal solution across various tasks. Many of them leverage transfer learning and seek to preserve, reuse, and refine network design knowledge to achieve higher efficiency in future tasks. However, the enormous computational cost and experiment complexity of cross-task NAS are imposing barriers for valuable research in this direction.

In this common, real-world scenario, almost all images belong to the background category in the dataset. We find that state-of-the-art approaches for training on imbalanced datasets do not produce accurate deep models in this regime. Our solution is to split the large, visually diverse background into many smaller, visually similar categories during training. We implement this idea by extending an image classification model with an additional auxiliary loss that learns to mimic the predictions of a pre-existing classification model on the training set. The auxiliary loss requires no additional human labels and regularizes feature learning in the shared network trunk by forcing the model to discriminate between auxiliary categories for all training set examples, including those belonging to the monolithic background of the main rare category classification task. To evaluate our method we contribute modified versions of the iNaturalist and Places365 datasets where only a small subset of rare category labels are available during training (all other images are labeled as background). By jointly learning to recognize both the selected rare categories and auxiliary categories, our approach yields models that perform 8.3 mAP points higher than state-of-the-art imbalanced learning baselines when 98.30% of the data is background, and up to 42.3 mAP points higher than fine-tuning baselines when 99.98% of the data is background.",True,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/papers/Wu_Track_To_Detect_and_Segment_An_Online_Multi-Object_Tracker_CVPR_2021_paper.pdf

Humans, even young toddlers, can induce causal relationships surprisingly well in various settings despite its notorious difficulty. However, in contrast to the commonplace trait of human cognition is the lack of a diagnostic benchmark to measure causal induction for modern Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems. Therefore, in this work, we introduce the Abstract Causal REasoning (ACRE) dataset for systematic evaluation of current vision systems in causal induction. Motivated by the stream of research on causal discovery in Blicket experiments, we query a visual reasoning system with the following four types of questions in either an independent scenario or an interventional scenario: direct, indirect, screening-off, and backward-blocking, intentionally going beyond the simple strategy of inducing causal relationships by covariation. By analyzing visual reasoning architectures on this testbed, we notice that pure neural models tend towards an associative strategy under their chance-level performance, whereas neuro-symbolic combinations struggle in backward-blocking reasoning.

Egocentric scene understanding poses unprecedented challenges: (1) due to large head movements, the images are taken from non-canonical viewpoints (i.e., tilted images) where existing models of geometry prediction do not apply; (2) dynamic foreground objects including hands constitute a large proportion of visual scenes. These challenges limit the performance of the existing models learned from large indoor datasets, such as ScanNet and NYUv2, which comprise predominantly upright images of static scenes. We present a multimodal spatial rectifier that stabilizes the egocentric images to a set of reference directions, which allows learning a coherent visual representation. Unlike unimodal spatial rectifier that often produces excessive perspective warp for egocentric images, the multimodal spatial rectifier learns from multiple directions that can minimize the impact of the perspective warp. To learn visual representations of the dynamic foreground objects, we present a new dataset called EDINA (Egocentric Depth on everyday INdoor Activities) that comprises more than 500K synchronized RGBD frames and gravity directions.

Training nightmode ISP networks relies on large-scale datasets of image pairs with: (1) a noisy raw image captured with a short exposure and a high ISO gain; and (2) a ground truth low-noise raw image captured with a long exposure and low ISO that has been rendered through the ISP. Capturing such image pairs is tedious and time-consuming, requiring careful setup to ensure alignment between the image pairs. In addition, ground truth images are often prone to motion blur due to the long exposure. To address this problem, we propose a method that synthesizes nighttime images from daytime images. Daytime images are easy to capture, exhibit low-noise (even on smartphone cameras) and rarely suffer from motion blur. We outline a processing framework to convert daytime raw images to have the appearance of realistic nighttime raw images with different levels of noise.

We introduce a method that uses visual observations to bridge the gap between languages, rather than relying on parallel corpora or topological properties of the representations. We train a model that aligns segments of text from different languages if and only if the images associated with them are similar and each image in turn is well-aligned with its textual description.

To tackle the task, we propose a deep learning architecture trained in a self-supervised manner by exploiting a further RGB camera, required only during training data acquisition. In this setup, we can conveniently learn cross-modal matching in the absence of ground-truth labels by distilling knowledge from an easier RGB-RGB matching task based on a collection of about 11K unlabeled image triplets.

CVPR-2022-18,CVPR,2022,Beyond Cross-View Image Retrieval: Highly Accurate Vehicle Localization Using Satellite Image,"Yujiao Shi, Hongdong Li","This paper addresses the problem of vehicle-mounted camera localization by matching a ground-level image with an overhead-view satellite map. Existing methods often treat this problem as cross-view image retrieval, and use learned deep features to match the ground-level query image to a partition (e.g., a small patch) of the satellite map. By these methods, the localization accuracy is limited by the partitioning density of the satellite map (often in the order of tens meters). Departing from the conventional wisdom of image retrieval, this paper presents a novel solution that can achieve highly-accurate localization. The key idea is to formulate the task as pose estimation and solve it by neural-net based optimization. Specifically, we design a two-branch CNN to extract robust features from the ground and satellite images, respectively. To bridge the vast cross-view domain gap, we resort to a Geometry Projection module that projects features from the satellite map to the ground-view, based on a relative camera pose. Aiming to minimize the differences between the projected features and the observed features, we employ a differentiable Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) module to search for the optimal camera pose iteratively. The entire pipeline is differentiable and runs end-to-end. Extensive experiments on standard autonomous vehicle localization datasets have confirmed the superiority of the proposed method. Notably, e.g., starting from a coarse estimate of camera location within a wide region of 40m x 40m, with an 80% likelihood our method quickly reduces the lateral location error to be within 5m on a new KITTI cross-view dataset.",True,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2022/papers/Kim_A_Brand_New_Dance_Partner_Music-Conditioned_Pluralistic_Dancing_Controlled_by_CVPR_2022_paper.pdf

In this scenario, anomaly detection is an open-set problem. However, some studies assimilate anomaly detection to action recognition. This is a closed-set scenario that fails to test the capability of systems at detecting new anomaly types. To this end, we propose UBnormal, a new supervised open-set benchmark composed of multiple virtual scenes for video anomaly detection. Unlike existing data sets, we introduce abnormal events annotated at the pixel level at training time, for the first time enabling the use of fully-supervised learning methods for abnormal event detection. To preserve the typical open-set formulation, we make sure to include disjoint sets of anomaly types in our training and test collections of videos. To our knowledge, UBnormal is the first video anomaly detection benchmark to allow a fair head-to-head comparison between one-class open-set models and supervised closed-set models, as shown in our experiments.

In response to such bias, we would like to re-emphasize that methods for multi-object tracking should also work when object appearance is not sufficiently discriminative. To this end, we propose a large-scale dataset for multi-human tracking, where humans have similar appearance, diverse motion and extreme articulation.

In this article, we propose an effective multimodal-driven deep neural network to perform 3D surface super-resolution in 2D normal domain, which is simple, accurate, and robust to the above difficulty. To leverage the multimodal information from different perspectives, we jointly consider the texture, depth, and normal modalities to simultaneously restore fine-grained surface details as well as preserve geometry structures. To better utilize the cross-modality information, we explore a two-bridge normal method with a transformer structure for feature alignment, and investigate an affine transform module for fusing multimodal features.

The temporal optimal transport module enables our approach to learn effective representations for unsupervised activity segmentation.

Scale is believed to be an important factor for this advance. However, most existing work only focuses on pre-training transformers with moderate sizes (e.g., 12 or 24 layers) on roughly 4 million images. In this paper, we present LEMON, a LargE-scale iMage captiONer, and provide the first empirical study on the scaling behavior of VLP for image captioning. We use the state-of-the-art VinVL model as our reference model, which consists of an image feature extractor and a transformer model, and scale the transformer both up and down, with model sizes ranging from 13 to 675 million parameters. In terms of data, we conduct experiments with up to 200 million image-text pairs which are automatically collected from web based on the alt attribute of the image (dubbed as ALT200M).

In this work, we propose a contrastive learning framework to enforce vision-language pretraining models to comprehend events and associated argument (participant) roles. To achieve this, we take advantage of text information extraction technologies to obtain event structural knowledge, and utilize multiple prompt functions to contrast difficult negative descriptions by manipulating event structures.

Black","While methods that regress 3D human meshes from images have progressed rapidly, the estimated body shapes often do not capture the true human shape. This is problematic since, for many applications, accurate body shape is as important as pose. The key reason that body shape accuracy lags pose accuracy is the lack of data. While humans can label 2D joints, and these constrain 3D pose, it is not so easy to ""label"" 3D body shape. Since paired data with images and 3D body shape are rare, we exploit two sources of information: (1) we collect internet images of diverse ""fashion"" models together with a small set of anthropometric measurements; (2) we collect linguistic shape attributes for a wide range of 3D body meshes and the model images. Taken together, these datasets provide sufficient constraints to infer dense 3D shape. We exploit the anthropometric measurements and linguistic shape attributes in several novel ways to train a neural network, called SHAPY, that regresses 3D human pose and shape from an RGB image. We evaluate SHAPY on public benchmarks, but note that they either lack significant body shape variation, ground-truth shape, or clothing variation. Thus, we collect a new dataset for evaluating 3D human shape estimation, called HBW, containing photos of ""Human Bodies in the Wild"" for which we have ground-truth 3D body scans. On this new benchmark, SHAPY significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the task of 3D body shape estimation.

Then, multiple decoders are cascaded to generate and progressively refine the premise and hypothesis sentences. The prediction scores of the sentences are used to guide cross-sentence information flow in the cascaded reasoning procedure.

However, they have some insuperable drawbacks, e.g., they cannot handle videos without references, and they may result in biased evaluation due to the one-to-many nature of video-to-text and the neglect of visual relevance. From the human evaluator's viewpoint, a high-quality caption should be consistent with the provided video, but not necessarily be similar to the reference in literal or semantics. Inspired by human evaluation, we propose EMScore (Embedding Matching-based score), a novel reference-free metric for video captioning, which directly measures similarity between video and candidate captions. Benefiting from the recent development of large-scale pre-training models, we exploit a well pre-trained vision-language model to extract visual and linguistic embeddings for computing EMScore. Specifically, EMScore combines matching scores of both coarse-grained (video and caption) and fine-grained (frames and words) levels, which takes the overall understanding and detailed characteristics of the video into account. Furthermore, considering the potential information gain, EMScore can be flexibly extended to the conditions where human-labeled references are available. Last but not least, we collect VATEX-EVAL and ActivityNet-FOIl datasets to systematically evaluate the existing metrics.

But collecting, processing and annotating real data at scale is difficult, expensive, and frequently raises additional privacy, fairness and legal concerns. Synthetic data is a powerful tool with the potential to address these shortcomings: 1) it is cheap 2) supports rich ground-truth annotations 3) offers full control over data and 4) can circumvent or mitigate problems regarding bias, privacy and licensing. Unfortunately, software tools for effective data generation are less mature than those for architecture design and training, which leads to fragmented generation efforts. To address these problems we introduce Kubric, an open-source Python framework that interfaces with PyBullet and Blender to generate photo-realistic scenes, with rich annotations, and seamlessly scales to large jobs distributed over thousands of machines, and generating TBs of data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Kubric by presenting a series of 11 different generated datasets for tasks ranging from studying 3D NeRF models to optical flow estimation.

However, the lack of paired training samples is the main bottleneck for unlocking the power of RGB-T tracking. Since it is laborious to collect high-quality RGB-T sequences, recent benchmarks only provide test sequences. In this paper, we construct a large-scale benchmark with high diversity for visible-thermal UAV tracking (VTUAV), including 500 sequences with 1.7 million high-resolution (1920*1080 pixels) frame pairs. In addition, comprehensive applications (short-term tracking, long-term tracking and segmentation mask prediction) with diverse categories and scenes are considered for exhaustive evaluation. Moreover, we provide a coarse-to-fine attribute annotation, where frame-level attributes are provided to exploit the potential of challenge-specific trackers. In addition, we design a new RGB-T baseline, named Hierarchical Multi-modal Fusion Tracker (HMFT), which fuses RGB-T data in various levels.

Thanks to the semantic diversity of natural language descriptions, temporal grounding allows activity grounding beyond pre-defined classes and has received increasing attention in recent years. The semantic diversity is rooted in the principle of compositionality in linguistics, where novel semantics can be systematically described by combining known words in novel ways (compositional generalization). However, current temporal grounding datasets do not specifically test for the compositional generalizability. To systematically measure the compositional generalizability of temporal grounding models, we introduce a new Compositional Temporal Grounding task and construct two new dataset splits, i.e., Charades-CG and ActivityNet-CG. Evaluating the state-of-the-art methods on our new dataset splits, we empirically find that they fail to generalize to queries with novel combinations of seen words. To tackle this challenge, we propose a variational cross-graph reasoning framework that explicitly decomposes video and language into multiple structured hierarchies and learns fine-grained semantic correspondence among them.

As a step in this direction, the ArtEmis dataset was recently introduced as a large-scale dataset of emotional reactions to images along with language explanations of these chosen emotions. We observed a significant emotional bias towards instance-rich emotions, making trained neural speakers less accurate in describing under-represented emotions. We show that collecting new data, in the same way, is not effective in mitigating this emotional bias. To remedy this problem, we propose a contrastive data collection approach to balance ArtEmis with a new complementary dataset such that a pair of similar images have contrasting emotions (one positive and one negative).

The widely used rolling-shutter (RS) image sensors, however, suffer from geometric distortion when the camera and object undergo motion during capture. Extensive researches have been conducted on correcting RS distortions. However, most of the existing work relies heavily on the prior assumptions of scenes or motions. Besides, the motion estimation steps are either oversimplified or computationally inefficient due to the heavy flow warping, limiting their applicability. In this paper, we investigate using rolling shutter with a global reset feature (RSGR) to restore clean global shutter (GS) videos. This feature enables us to turn the rectification problem into a deblur-like one, getting rid of inaccurate and costly explicit motion estimation. First, we build an optic system that captures paired RSGR/GS videos. Second, we develop a novel algorithm incorporating spatial and temporal designs to correct the spatial-varying RSGR distortion. Third, we demonstrate that existing image-to-image translation algorithms can recover clean GS videos from distorted RSGR inputs, yet our algorithm achieves the best performance with the specific designs. Our rendered results are not only visually appealing but also beneficial to downstream tasks.

This work presents a multimodal video generation framework that benefits from text and images provided jointly or separately.

Estimating these severely occluded regions from monocular images presents a considerable challenge. Existing methods optimize the hand-object contact driven by distance threshold or prior from contact-labeled datasets. However, due to the number of subjects and objects involved in these indoor datasets being limited, the learned contact patterns could not generalize easily. Our key idea is to reconstruct the contact pattern directly from monocular images and utilize the physical stability criterion in the simulation to drive the optimization process described above. This criterion is defined by the resultant forces and contact distribution computed by the physics engine. Compared to existing solutions, our framework can be adapted to more personalized hands and diverse object shapes.

The proposed solution is based on a novel scene graph model, the Spatial Commonsense Graph (SCG), where objects are the nodes and edges define pairwise distances between them, enriched by concept nodes and relationships from a commonsense knowledge base. This allows SCG to better generalise its spatial inference to unknown 3D scenes.

USG is the most common diagnostic modality for GB diseases due to its low cost and accessibility. However, USG images are challenging to analyze due to low image quality, noise, and varying viewpoints due to the handheld nature of the sensor. Our exhaustive study of state-of-the-art (SOTA) image classification techniques for the problem reveals that they often fail to learn the salient GB region due to the presence of shadows in the USG images. SOTA object detection techniques also achieve low accuracy because of spurious textures due to noise or adjacent organs. We propose GBCNet to tackle the challenges in our problem. GBCNet first extracts the regions of interest (ROIs) by detecting the GB (and not the cancer), and then uses a new multi-scale, second-order pooling architecture specializing in classifying GBC. To effectively handle spurious textures, we propose a curriculum inspired by human visual acuity, which reduces the texture biases in GBCNet. Experimental results demonstrate that GBCNet significantly outperforms SOTA CNN models, as well as the expert radiologists.

However, learning to recognise human actions and their social interactions in an unconstrained real-world environment comprising numerous people, with potentially highly unbalanced and long-tailed distributed action labels from a stream of sensory data captured from a mobile robot platform remains a significant challenge, not least owing to the lack of a reflective large-scale dataset.

Each annotated label in JRDB-Act is tagged with the annotators' confidence level which contributes to the development of reliable evaluation strategies.

Existing methods alleviate performance drop via domain alignment in a shared space and assume that the mapping from the aligned space to the output is transferable. However, the novel content induced by viewpoint changes may nullify such a space for effective alignments, thus resulting in negative adaptation. Our method works without aligning any statistics of the images between the two domains. Instead, it utilizes a novel attention-based view transformation network trained only on color images to hallucinate the semantic images for the target. Despite the lack of supervision, the view transformation network can still generalize to semantic images thanks to the induced ""information transport"" bias. Furthermore, to resolve ambiguities in converting the semantic images to semantic labels, we treat the view transformation network as a functional representation of an unknown mapping implied by the color images and propose functional label hallucination to generate pseudo-labels with uncertainties in the target domains.

Recent methods for HMER have achieved outstanding performance with an encoder-decoder architecture. However, these methods adhere to the paradigm that the prediction is made ""from one character to another"", which inevitably yields prediction errors due to the complicated structures of mathematical expressions or crabbed handwritings. In this paper, we propose a simple and efficient method for HMER, which is the first to incorporate syntax information into an encoder-decoder network. Specifically, we present a set of grammar rules for converting the LaTeX markup sequence of each expression into a parsing tree; then, we model the markup sequence prediction as a tree traverse process with a deep neural network. In this way, the proposed method can effectively describe the syntax context of expressions, alleviating the structure prediction errors of HMER. Experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves better recognition performance than prior arts. To further validate the effectiveness of our method, we create a large-scale dataset consisting of 100k handwritten mathematical expression images acquired from ten thousand writers.

Applications of MUFIN to product-to-product recommendation and bid query prediction over several millions of products are presented. Contemporary multi-modal methods frequently rely on purely embedding-based methods. On the other hand, XC methods utilize classifier architectures to offer superior accuracies than embedding-only methods but mostly focus on text-based categorization tasks. MUFIN bridges this gap by reformulating multi-modal categorization as an XC problem with several millions of labels. This presents the twin challenges of developing multi-modal architectures that can offer embeddings sufficiently expressive to allow accurate categorization over millions of labels; and training and inference routines that scale logarithmically in the number of labels. MUFIN develops an architecture based on cross-modal attention and trains it in a modular fashion using pre-training and positive and negative mining. A novel product-to-product recommendation dataset MM-AmazonTitles-300K containing over 300K products was curated from publicly available amazon.com listings with each product endowed with a title and multiple images.

Human has the ability that transform the various exocentric interactions to invariant egocentric affordance so as to counter the impact of interactive diversity. To empower an agent with such ability, this paper proposes a task of affordance grounding from exocentric view, i.e., given exocentric human-object interaction and egocentric object images, learning the affordance knowledge of the object and transferring it to the egocentric image using only the affordance label as supervision. To this end, we devise a cross-view knowledge transfer framework that extracts affordance-specific features from exocentric interactions and enhances the perception of affordance regions by preserving affordance correlation. Specifically, an Affordance Invariance Mining module is devised to extract specific clues by minimizing the intra-class differences originated from interaction habits in exocentric images. Besides, an Affordance Co-relation Preserving strategy is presented to perceive and localize affordance by aligning the co-relation matrix of predicted results between the two views.

Using the HDR-NeRF, we are able to generate both novel HDR views and novel LDR views under different exposures. The key to our method is to model the physical imaging process, which dictates that the radiance of a scene point transforms to a pixel value in the LDR image with two implicit functions: a radiance field and a tone mapper. The radiance field encodes the scene radiance (values vary from 0 to +infty), which outputs the density and radiance of a ray by giving corresponding ray origin and ray direction. The tone mapper models the mapping process that a ray hitting on the camera sensor becomes a pixel value. The color of the ray is predicted by feeding the radiance and the corresponding exposure time into the tone mapper. We use the classic volume rendering technique to project the output radiance, colors, and densities into HDR and LDR images, while only the input LDR images are used as the supervision. We collect a new forward-facing HDR dataset to evaluate the proposed method.

We take image samples from the class-conditional generative model BigGAN trained on ImageNet, and manually annotate only 5 images per class, for all 1k classes. By training an effective feature segmentation architecture on top of BigGAN, we turn BigGAN into a labeled dataset generator.

Automated GAI has the benefit of greatly assisting inspectors with their jobs but has been limited due to the lack of datasets and clear definitions of the tasks.

Chan, Shangchen Zhou, Xiangyu Xu, Chen Change Loy","The diversity and complexity of degradations in real-world video super-resolution (VSR) pose non-trivial challenges in inference and training. First, while long-term propagation leads to improved performance in cases of mild degradations, severe in-the-wild degradations could be exaggerated through propagation, impairing output quality. To balance the tradeoff between detail synthesis and artifact suppression, we found an image pre-cleaning stage indispensable to reduce noises and artifacts prior to propagation. Equipped with a carefully designed cleaning module, our RealBasicVSR outperforms existing methods in both quality and efficiency. Second, real-world VSR models are often trained with diverse degradations to improve generalizability, requiring increased batch size to produce a stable gradient. Inevitably, the increased computational burden results in various problems, including 1) speed-performance tradeoff and 2) batch-length tradeoff. To alleviate the first tradeoff, we propose a stochastic degradation scheme that reduces up to 40% of training time without sacrificing performance. We then analyze different training settings and suggest that employing longer sequences rather than larger batches during training allows more effective uses of temporal information, leading to more stable performance during inference.

In this paper, we propose a set of innovative designs to tackle the problem of practical stereo matching: 1) to better recover fine depth details, we design a hierarchical network with recurrent refinement to update disparities in a coarse-to-fine manner, as well as a stacked cascaded architecture for inference; 2) we propose an adaptive group correlation layer to mitigate the impact of erroneous rectification; 3) we introduce a new synthetic dataset with special attention to difficult cases for better generalizing to real-world scenes.

Prior works use visual features extracted with a backbone network, pre-trained for object classification and thus do not capture the subtly distinct features associated with attributes. To overcome this challenge, these studies employ supervision from the linguistic space, and use pre-trained word embeddings to better separate and compose attribute-object pairs for recognition. Analogous to linguistic embedding space, which already has unique and agnostic embeddings for object and attribute, we shift the focus back to the visual space and propose a novel architecture that can disentangle attribute and object features in the visual space. We use visual decomposed features to hallucinate embeddings that are representative for the seen and novel compositions to better regularize the learning of our model.

Unlike existing instance-level or category-level methods, OnePose does not rely on CAD models and can handle objects in arbitrary categories without instance- or category-specific network training. OnePose draws the idea from visual localization and only requires a simple RGB video scan of the object to build a sparse SfM model of the object. Then, this model is registered to new query images with a generic feature matching network. To mitigate the slow runtime of existing visual localization methods, we propose a new graph attention network that directly matches 2D interest points in the query image with the 3D points in the SfM model, resulting in efficient and robust pose estimation. Combined with a feature-based pose tracker, OnePose is able to stably detect and track 6D poses of everyday household objects in real-time.

While a plethora of algorithms have been proposed for OoD generalization, our understanding of the data used to train and evaluate these algorithms remains stagnant. In this work, we first identify and measure two distinct kinds of distribution shifts that are ubiquitous in various datasets. Next, through extensive experiments, we compare OoD generalization algorithms across two groups of benchmarks, each dominated by one of the distribution shifts, revealing their strengths on one shift as well as limitations on the other shift.

Due to their sensing mechanism, event cameras have little to no motion blur, a very high temporal resolution and require significantly less power and memory than traditional frame-based cameras. These characteristics make them a perfect fit to several real-world applications such as egocentric action recognition on wearable devices, where fast camera motion and limited power challenge traditional vision sensors. However, the ever-growing field of event-based vision has, to date, overlooked the potential of event cameras in such applications. In this paper, we show that event data is a very valuable modality for egocentric action recognition. To do so, we introduce N-EPIC-Kitchens, the first event-based camera extension of the large-scale EPIC-Kitchens dataset. In this context, we propose two strategies: (i) directly processing event-camera data with traditional video-processing architectures (E^2(GO)) and (ii) using event-data to distill optical flow information E^2(GO)MO). On our proposed benchmark, we show that event data provides a comparable performance to RGB and optical flow, yet without any additional flow computation at deploy time, and an improved performance of up to 4% with respect to RGB only information.

This configuration has a number of practical benefits, e.g., when processing large-scale datasets. Moreover, it is resistant to the typical degenerate cases of the traditional six-point algorithm. The minimal solver requires four point correspondences and exploits the gravity direction that the built-in IMU of recent smart devices recover. We also propose a linear solver that enables estimating the pose from a larger-than-minimal sample extremely efficiently which then can be improved by, e.g., bundle adjustment.

Therefore, much effort has been put into designing suitable constraints, e.g., cycle consistency (CycleGAN), geometry consistency (GCGAN), and contrastive learning-based constraints (CUTGAN), that help better pose the problem. However, these well-known constraints have limitations: (1) they are either too restrictive or too weak for specific I2I tasks; (2) these methods result in content distortion when there is a significant spatial variation between the source and target domains. This paper proposes a universal regularization technique called maximum spatial perturbation consistency (MSPC), which enforces a spatial perturbation function (T) and the translation operator (G) to be commutative (i.e., T \\\\circ G = G \\\\circ T ). In addition, we introduce two adversarial training components for learning the spatial perturbation function. The first one lets T compete with G to achieve maximum perturbation. The second one lets G and T compete with discriminators to align the spatial variations caused by the change of object size, object distortion, background interruptions, etc. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on most I2I benchmarks.

Adversarial patch attacks, which are easy to implement in the physical world, pose a serious threat to state-of-the-art object detectors. Developing reliable defenses for object detectors against patch attacks is critical but severely understudied. In this paper, we propose Segment and Complete defense (SAC), a general framework for defending object detectors against patch attacks through detection and removal of adversarial patches. We first train a patch segmenter that outputs patch masks which provide pixel-level localization of adversarial patches. We then propose a self adversarial training algorithm to robustify the patch segmenter. In addition, we design a robust shape completion algorithm, which is guaranteed to remove the entire patch from the images if the outputs of the patch segmenter are within a certain Hamming distance of the ground-truth patch masks. Our experiments on COCO and xView datasets demonstrate that SAC achieves superior robustness even under strong adaptive attacks with no reduction in performance on clean images, and generalizes well to unseen patch shapes, attack budgets, and unseen attack methods. Furthermore, we present the APRICOT-Mask dataset, which augments the APRICOT dataset with pixel-level annotations of adversarial patches.

First, we develop a point cloud collector and scene flow annotator for GTA-V engine to automatically obtain diverse realistic training samples without human intervention. With that, we develop a large-scale synthetic scene flow dataset GTA-SF. Second, we propose a mean-teacher-based domain adaptation framework that leverages self-generated pseudo-labels of the target domain.

However, the existing referring video semantic segmentation works mainly focus on the guidance of text-based referring expressions, due to the lack of modeling the semantic representation of audio-video interaction contents. In this paper, we consider the problem of audio-guided video semantic segmentation from the viewpoint of end-to-end denoised encoder-decoder network learning. We propose the walvelet-based encoder network to learn the crossmodal representations of the video contents with audio-form queries. Specifically, we adopt a multi-head cross-modal attention to explore the potential relations of video and query contents. A 2-dimension discrete wavelet transform is employed to decompose the audio-video features. We quantify the thresholds of high frequency coefficients to filter the noise and outliers. Then, a self attention-free decoder network is developed to generate the target masks with frequency domain transforms. Moreover, we maximize mutual information between the encoded features and multi-modal features after cross-modal attention to enhance the audio guidance. In addition, we construct the first large-scale audio-guided video semantic segmentation dataset.

Previous work focuses on reconstructing pre-defined 3D representations, e.g. textured meshes, or implicit representations, e.g. radiance fields, and often requires input images with precise camera poses and long processing times for each novel scene. In this work, we propose the Scene Representation Transformer (SRT), a method which processes posed or unposed RGB images of a new area, infers a ""set-latent scene representation"", and synthesises novel views, all in a single feed-forward pass. To calculate the scene representation, we propose a generalization of the Vision Transformer to sets of images, enabling global information integration, and hence 3D reasoning. An efficient decoder transformer parameterizes the light field by attending into the scene representation to render novel views.

However, organs move and deform as the patient changes his/her pose. In order to obtain accurate target location information, clinicians have to either conduct frequent intraoperative scans, resulting in higher exposition of patients to radiations, or adopt proxy procedures (e.g., creating and using custom molds to keep patients in the exact same pose during both preoperative organ scanning and subsequent treatment. Such custom proxy methods are typically sub-optimal, constraining the clinicians and costing precious time and money to the patients. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to present a learning-based approach to estimate the patient's internal organ deformation for arbitrary human poses in order to assist with radiotherapy and similar medical protocols. The underlying method first leverages medical scans to learn a patient-specific representation that potentially encodes the organ's shape and elastic properties. During inference, given the patient's current body pose information and the organ's representation extracted from previous medical scans, our method can estimate their current organ deformation to offer guidance to clinicians. We conduct experiments on a well-sized dataset which is augmented through real clinical data using finite element modeling.

However, the immense diversity of the OOD examples makes such methods fragile. There are OOD samples that are easy to identify in the feature space while hard to distinguish in the logit space and vice versa. Motivated by this observation, we propose a novel OOD scoring method named Virtual-logit Matching (ViM), which combines the class-agnostic score from feature space and the In-Distribution (ID) class-dependent logits. Specifically, an additional logit representing the virtual OOD class is generated from the residual of the feature against the principal space, and then matched with the original logits by a constant scaling. The probability of this virtual logit after softmax is the indicator of OOD-ness.

In this paper, we propose an iterative correcting approach operating in 3D space, that is designed to learn on 2.5D data by enabling 3D point convolutions to correct the points' positions along the view direction. As labeled real world data is scarce for this task, we further train our network with a self-training approach on unlabeled real world data to account for real world statistics.

Existing research on gesture recognition is limited to close-range interaction such as vehicle gesture control and face-to-face communication. To apply gesture recognition to long-distance interactive scenes such as meetings and smart homes, a large RGB-D video dataset LD-ConGR is established in this paper. LD-ConGR is distinguished from existing gesture datasets by its long-distance gesture collection, fine-grained annotations, and high video quality. Specifically, 1) the farthest gesture provided by the LD-ConGR is captured 4m away from the camera while existing gesture datasets collect gestures within 1m from the camera; 2) besides the gesture category, the temporal segmentation of gestures and hand location are also annotated in LD-ConGR; 3) videos are captured at high resolution (1280x720 for color streams and 640x576 for depth streams) and high frame rate (30 fps). On top of the LD-ConGR, a series of experimental and studies are conducted, and the proposed gesture region estimation and key frame sampling strategies are demonstrated to be effective in dealing with long-distance gesture recognition and the uncertainty of gesture duration.

While degradation-specific image restoration techniques have been extensively studied, such algorithms are domain sensitive and fail in real scenarios where multiple degradations exist simultaneously. This makes a case for blind image restoration and reconstruction algorithms as practically relevant. However, the absence of a dataset diverse enough to encapsulate all variations hinders development for such an algorithm. In this paper, we utilize a synthetic degradation model that recursively applies sets of random degradations to generate naturalistic degradation images of varying complexity, which are used as input. Furthermore, as the degradation intensity can vary across an image, the spatially invariant convolutional filter cannot be applied for all degradations. Hence to enable spatial variance during image restoration and reconstruction, we design a transformer-based architecture to benefit from the long-range dependencies. In addition, to reduce the computational cost of transformers, we propose a multi-branch structure coupled with modifications such as a complimentary feature selection mechanism and the replacement of a feed-forward network with lightweight multiscale convolutions. Finally, to improve restoration and reconstruction, we integrate an auxiliary decoder branch to predict the degradation mask to ensure the underlying network can localize the degradation information.

To setup the pre-training task, we apply a simple online multi-object tracking system on raw videos of an existing unlabeled Re-ID dataset ""LUPerson"" and build the Noisy Labeled variant called ""LUPerson-NL"". Since theses ID labels automatically derived from tracklets inevitably contain noises, we develop a large-scale Pre-training framework utilizing Noisy Labels (PNL), which consists of three learning modules: supervised Re-ID learning, prototype-based contrastive learning, and label-guided contrastive learning. In principle, joint learning of these three modules not only clusters similar examples to one prototype, but also rectifies noisy labels based on the prototype assignment. We demonstrate that learning directly from raw videos is a promising alternative for pre-training, which utilizes spatial and temporal correlations as weak supervision. This simple pre-training task provides a scalable way to learn SOTA Re-ID representations from scratch on ""LUPerson-NL"" without bells and whistles. For example, by applying on the same supervised Re-ID method MGN, our pre-trained model improves the mAP over the unsupervised pre-training counterpart by 5.7%, 2.2%, 2.3%  on CUHK03, DukeMTMC, and MSMT17 respectively.

While the majority of existing part assembly methods focus on correctly posing semantic parts to recreate a whole object, we interpret assembly more literally: as mating geometric parts together to achieve a snug fit. By focusing on shape alignment rather than semantic cues, we can achieve across category generalization and scaling. In this paper, we introduce a novel task, pairwise 3D geometric shape mating, and propose Neural Shape Mating (NSM) to tackle this problem. Given point clouds of two object parts of an unknown category, NSM learns to reason about the fit of the two parts and predict a pair of 3D poses that tightly mate them together. In addition, we couple the training of NSM with an implicit shape reconstruction task, making NSM more robust to imperfect point cloud observations. To train NSM, we present a self-supervised data collection pipeline that generates pairwise shape mating data with ground truth by randomly cutting an object mesh into two parts, resulting in a dataset that consists of 200K shape mating pairs with numerous object meshes and diverse cut types. We train NSM on the collected dataset and compare it with several point cloud registration methods and one part assembly baseline approach.

While existing unsupervised methods are able to learn image denoising without ground-truth clean images, they either show poor performance or work under impractical settings (e.g., paired noisy images). In this paper, we present a practical unsupervised image denoising method to achieve state-of-the-art denoising performance. Our method only requires single noisy images and a noise model, which is easily accessible in practical raw image denoising. It performs two steps iteratively: (1) Constructing a noisier-noisy dataset with random noise from the noise model; (2) training a model on the noisier-noisy dataset and using the trained model to refine noisy images to obtain the targets used in the next round. We further approximate our full iterative method with a fast algorithm for more efficient training while keeping its original high performance. Experiments on real-world, synthetic, and correlated noise show that our proposed unsupervised denoising approach has superior performances over existing unsupervised methods and competitive performance with supervised methods. In addition, we argue that existing denoising datasets are of low quality and contain only a small number of scenes. To evaluate raw image denoising performance in real-world applications, we build a high-quality raw image dataset SenseNoise-500 that contains 500 real-life scenes.

CVPR-2022-1209,CVPR,2022,Habitat-Web: Learning Embodied Object-Search Strategies From Human Demonstrations at Scale,"Ram Ramrakhya, Eric Undersander, Dhruv Batra, Abhishek Das","We present a large-scale study of imitating human demonstrations on tasks that require a virtual robot to search for objects in new environments - (1) ObjectGoal Navigation (e.g. 'find & go to a chair') and (2) Pick&Place (e.g. 'find mug, pick mug, find counter, place mug on counter'). First, we develop a virtual teleoperation data-collection infrastructure - connecting Habitat simulator running in a web browser to Amazon Mechanical Turk, allowing remote users to teleoperate virtual robots, safely and at scale. We collect 80k demonstrations for ObjectNav and 12k demonstrations for Pick&Place, which is an order of magnitude larger than existing human demonstration datasets in simulation or on real robots. Our virtual teleoperation data contains 29.3M actions, and is equivalent to 22.6k hours of real-world teleoperation time, and illustrates rich, diverse strategies for solving the tasks. Second, we use this data to answer the question - how does large-scale imitation learning (IL) (which has not been hitherto possible) compare to reinforcement learning (RL) (which is the status quo)? On ObjectNav, we find that IL (with no bells or whistles) using 70k human demonstrations outperforms RL using 240k agent-gathered trajectories. This effectively establishes an 'exchange rate' - a single human demonstration appears to be worth  4 agent-gathered ones. More importantly, we find the IL-trained agent learns efficient object-search behavior from humans - it peeks into rooms, checks corners for small objects, turns in place to get a panoramic view - none of these are exhibited as prominently by the RL agent, and to induce these behaviors via contemporary RL techniques would require tedious reward engineering. Finally, accuracy vs. training data size plots show promising scaling behavior, suggesting that simply collecting more demonstrations is likely to advance the state of art further. On Pick&Place, the comparison is starker - IL agents achieve  18% success on episodes with new object-receptacle locations when trained with 9.5k human demonstrations, while RL agents fail to get beyond 0%. Overall, our work provides compelling evidence for investing in large-scale imitation learning.

To tackle the problem, we point out the importance of fully exploring the appearance and geometric relationship between the given support views and query scene patches and propose a dense prototypes matching framework by extracting and matching dense RGBD prototypes with transformers. Moreover, we show that the priors from diverse appearances and shapes are crucial to the generalization capability under the problem setting and thus propose a large-scale RGBD photorealistic dataset (ShapeNet6D) for network pre-training.

However, in real-world scenarios (e.g., MRI medical diagnosis, X-ray security inspection), there still exists another type of shift, named endogenous shift, where the differences between domains are mainly caused by the intrinsic factors (e.g., imaging mechanisms, hardware components, etc.), and usually inconspicuous. This shift can also severely harm the cross-domain detection performance but has been rarely studied. To support this study, we contribute the first Endogenous Domain Shift (EDS) benchmark, X-ray security inspection, where the endogenous shifts among the domains are mainly caused by different X-ray machine types with different hardware parameters, wear degrees, etc. EDS consists of 14,219 images including 31,654 common instances from three domains (X-ray machines), with bounding-box annotations from 10 categories. To handle the endogenous shift, we further introduce the Perturbation Suppression Network (PSN), motivated by the fact that this shift is mainly caused by two types of perturbations: category-dependent and category-independent ones. PSN respectively exploits local prototype alignment and global adversarial learning mechanism to suppress these two types of perturbations. The comprehensive evaluation results show that PSN outperforms SOTA methods, serving a new perspective to the cross-domain research community.",True,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2022/papers/Wang_Multimodal_Token_Fusion_for_Vision_Transformers_CVPR_2022_paper.pdf

In our analysis, we consider diverse state-of-the-art architectures (ResNets, Transformers) and training procedures (CLIP, SimCLR, DeiT, Adversarial Training). We find that, somewhat surprisingly, in ResNets, adversarial training makes models more sensitive to the background compared to foreground than standard training. Similarly, contrastively-trained models also have lower relative foreground sensitivity in both transformers and ResNets. Lastly, we observe intriguing adaptive abilities of transformers to increase relative foreground sensitivity as corruption level increases. Using saliency methods, we automatically discover spurious features that drive the background sensitivity of models and assess alignment of saliency maps with foregrounds.

Sander","Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) has gained considerable attention recently for 3D scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis due to its remarkable synthesis quality. However, image blurriness caused by defocus or motion, which often occurs when capturing scenes in the wild, significantly degrades its reconstruction quality. To address this problem, We propose Deblur-NeRF, the first method that can recover a sharp NeRF from blurry input. We adopt an analysis-by-synthesis approach that reconstructs blurry views by simulating the blurring process, thus making NeRF robust to blurry inputs. The core of this simulation is a novel Deformable Sparse Kernel (DSK) module that models spatially-varying blur kernels by deforming a canonical sparse kernel at each spatial location. The ray origin of each kernel point is jointly optimized, inspired by the physical blurring process. This module is parameterized as an MLP that has the ability to be generalized to various blur types. Jointly optimizing the NeRF and the DSK module allows us to restore a sharp NeRF. We demonstrate that our method can be used on both camera motion blur and defocus blur: the two most common types of blur in real scenes. Evaluation results on both synthetic and real-world data show that our method outperforms several baselines.

To tackle these technical challenges, we propose a human instance matting framework, called InstMatt, where a novel mutual guidance strategy working in tandem with a multi-instance refinement module is used, for delineating multi-instance relationship among humans with complex and overlapping boundaries if present.

However, when inferring on long video sequences presenting low motion (i.e. in which some parts of the scene barely move), recurrent models diverge through recurrent processing, generating high frequency artifacts. To the best of our knowledge, no study about VSR pointed out this instability problem, which can be critical for some real-world applications. Video surveillance is a typical example where such artifacts would occur, as both the camera and the scene stay static for a long time.

The input data to create a 3D face model ranges from accurate laser scans to simple 2D RGB photographs. These input data types are typically deficient either due to missing regions, or because they are under-constrained. As a result, reconstruction methods include embedded priors encoding the valid domain of faces. System designers must choose a source of input data and then choose a reconstruction method to obtain a usable 3D face. If a particular application domain requires accuracy X, which kinds of input data are suitable? Does the input data need to be 3D, or will 2D data suffice? This paper takes a step toward answering these questions using synthetic data. A ground truth dataset is used to analyze accuracy obtainable from 2D landmarks, 3D landmarks, low quality 3D, high quality 3D, texture color, normals, dense 2D image data, and when regions of the face are missing. Since the data is synthetic it can be analyzed both with and without measurement error.

It is the first study showing that previous representative state-of-the-art FS-Seg methods fall short in GFS-Seg and the performance discrepancy mainly comes from the constrained setting of FS-Seg.

Existing POL methods heavily reply on accurate key-point annotations which are difficult to define. In this study, we propose a POL method using coarse point annotations, relaxing the supervision signals from accurate key points to freely spotted points. To this end, we propose a coarse point refinement (CPR) approach, which to our best knowledge is the first attempt to alleviate semantic variance from the perspective of algorithm. CPR constructs point bags, selects semantic-correlated points, and produces semantic center points through multiple instance learning (MIL).

However, these solutions only work for images with rich linear structures, leading to noticeable distortions for portraits and landscapes with non-linear objects. In this paper, we address these issues by proposing the first deep learning solution to image rectangling. Concretely, we predefine a rigid target mesh and only estimate an initial mesh to form the mesh deformation, contributing to a compact one-stage solution. The initial mesh is predicted using a fully convolutional network with a residual progressive regression strategy. To obtain results with high content fidelity, a comprehensive objective function is proposed to simultaneously encourage the boundary rectangular, mesh shape-preserving, and content perceptually natural.

While detecting 2D human-object interaction (HOI) and reconstructing 3D human pose and shape (HPS) have enjoyed significant progress, reasoning about 3D human-scene contact from a single image is still challenging. Existing HSC detection methods consider only a few types of predefined contact, often reduce body and scene to a small number of primitives, and even overlook image evidence. To predict human-scene contact from a single image, we address the limitations above from both data and algorithmic perspectives. We capture a new dataset called RICH for ""Real scenes, Interaction, Contact and Humans."" RICH contains multiview outdoor/indoor video sequences at 4K resolution, ground-truth 3D human bodies captured using markerless motion capture, 3D body scans, and high resolution 3D scene scans. A key feature of RICH is that it also contains accurate vertex-level contact labels on the body. Using RICH, we train a network that predicts dense body-scene contacts from a single RGB image. Our key insight is that regions in contact are always occluded so the network needs the ability to explore the whole image for evidence. We use a transformer to learn such non-local relationships and propose a new Body-Scene contact TRansfOrmer (BSTRO). Very few methods explore 3D contact; those that do focus on the feet only, detect foot contact as a post-processing step, or infer contact from body pose without looking at the scene.

In this paper, we present a multi-view approach to estimate the accurate 3D poses of real moving objects, and then use binocular data to construct a new benchmark for monocular textureless 3D object tracking. The proposed method requires no markers, and the cameras only need to be synchronous, relatively fixed as cross-view and calibrated. Based on our object-centered model, we jointly optimize the object pose by minimizing shape re-projection constraints in all views, which greatly improves the accuracy compared with the single-view approach, and is even more accurate than the depth-based method. Our new benchmark dataset contains 20 textureless objects, 22 scenes, 404 video sequences and 126K images captured in real scenes. The annotation error is guaranteed to be less than 2mm, according to both theoretical analysis and validation experiments.

The unknown camera motions during the imaging process cause the so-called RS effects which are solved by motion assumptions in the literature. In this work, we give a solution to the absolute pose problem free of motion assumptions. We categorically demonstrate that the only requirement is motion smoothness instead of stronger constraints on the camera motion. To this end, we propose a novel mathematical abstraction for RS cameras observing a planar scene, called the scanline-homography, a 3x2 matrix with 5 DOFs. We establish the relationship between a scanline-homography and the corresponding plane-homography, a 3x3 matrix with 6 DOFs assuming the camera is calibrated. We estimate the scanline-homographies of an RS frame using a smooth image warp powered by B-Splines, and recover the plane-homographies afterwards to obtain the scanline-poses based on motion smoothness.

Existing methods focus on performing repetitive action counting in short videos, which is tough for dealing with longer videos in more realistic scenarios. In the data-driven era, the degradation of such generalization capability is mainly attributed to the lack of long video datasets. To complement this margin, we introduce a new large-scale repetitive action counting dataset covering a wide variety of video lengths, along with more realistic situations where action interruption or action inconsistencies occur in the video. Besides, we also provide a fine-grained annotation of the action cycles instead of just counting annotation along with a numerical value. Such a dataset contains 1,451 videos with about 20,000 annotations, which is more challenging. For repetitive action counting towards more realistic scenarios, we further propose encoding multi-scale temporal correlation with transformers that can take into account both performance and efficiency. Furthermore, with the help of fine-grained annotation of action cycles, we propose a density map regression-based method to predict the action period, which yields better performance with sufficient interpretability.

However, in safety-critical settings, robustness to out-of-domain and long-tail samples is fundamental to circumvent dangerous issues, such as the misdetection of damaged or rare cars. In this work, we substantially improve the generalization of 3D object detectors to out-of-domain data by deforming point clouds during training. We achieve this with 3D-VField: a novel data augmentation method that plausibly deforms objects via vector fields learned in an adversarial fashion. Our approach constrains 3D points to slide along their sensor view rays while neither adding nor removing any of them. The obtained vectors are transferable, sample-independent and preserve shape and occlusions.

An essential property of camouflaged objects is that they usually exhibit patterns similar to the background and thus make them hard to identify from still images. Therefore, effectively handling temporal dynamics in videos becomes the key for the VCOD task as the camouflaged objects will be noticeable when they move. However, current VCOD methods often leverage homography or optical flows to represent motions, where the detection error may accumulate from both the motion estimation error and the segmentation error. On the other hand, our method unifies motion estimation and object segmentation within a single optimization framework. Specifically, we build a dense correlation volume to implicitly capture motions between neighbouring frames and utilize the final segmentation supervision to optimize the implicit motion estimation and segmentation jointly. Furthermore, to enforce temporal consistency within a video sequence, we jointly utilize a spatio-temporal transformer to refine the short-term predictions. Extensive experiments on VCOD benchmarks demonstrate the architectural effectiveness of our approach.

While several recent works exploit tree-based algorithm to preserve image content better, all of them resort to hand-crafted adjustment rules to optimize the collage tree structure, leading to the failure of fully exploring the structure space of collage tree. Our key idea is to soften the discrete tree structure space into a continuous probability space. We propose SoftCollage, a novel method that employs a neural-based differentiable probabilistic tree generator to produce the probability distribution of correlation-preserving collage tree conditioned on deep image feature, aspect ratio and canvas size. The differentiable characteristic allows us to formulate the tree-based collage generation as a differentiable process and directly exploit gradient to optimize the collage layout in the level of probability space in an end-to-end manner.

Using a model trained on labeled images to the video frames directly may lead to high generalization error and temporal inconsistent results. In this paper, we address these challenges by proposing a Spatio-Temporal Interpolation Consistency Training (STICT) framework to rationally feed the unlabeled video frames together with the labeled images into an image shadow detection network training. Specifically, we propose the Spatial and Temporal ICT, in which we define two new interpolation schemes, i.e., the spatial interpolation and the temporal interpolation. We then derive the spatial and temporal interpolation consistency constraints accordingly for enhancing generalization in the pixel-wise classification task and for encouraging temporal consistent predictions, respectively. In addition, we design a Scale-Aware Network for multi-scale shadow knowledge learning in images, and propose a scale-consistency constraint to minimize the discrepancy among the predictions at different scales. Our proposed approach is extensively validated on the ViSha dataset and a self-annotated dataset. Experimental results show that, even without video labels, our approach is better than most state of the art supervised, semi-supervised or unsupervised image/video shadow detection methods and other methods in related tasks.

Meanwhile, the widespread availability of online social networks (OSNs) makes them the dominant channels for transmitting forged images to report fake news, propagate rumors, etc. Unfortunately, various lossy operations adopted by OSNs, e.g., compression and resizing, impose great challenges for implementing the robust image forgery detection. To fight against the OSN-shared forgeries, in this work, a novel robust training scheme is proposed. We first conduct a thorough analysis of the noise introduced by OSNs, and decouple it into two parts, i.e., predictable noise and unseen noise, which are modelled separately. The former simulates the noise introduced by the disclosed (known) operations of OSNs, while the latter is designed to not only complete the previous one, but also take into account the defects of the detector itself. We then incorporate the modelled noise into a robust training framework, significantly improving the robustness of the image forgery detector. Extensive experimental results are presented to validate the superiority of the proposed scheme compared with several state-of-the-art competitors. Finally, to promote the future development of the image forgery detection, we build a public forgeries dataset based on four existing datasets and three most popular OSNs.

Most current works mainly focus on modeling body shape from multi-modality information (e.g., silhouettes and sketches), but do not make full use of the clothes-irrelevant information in the original RGB images. In this paper, we propose a Clothes-based Adversarial Loss (CAL) to mine clothes-irrelevant features from the original RGB images by penalizing the predictive power of re-id model w.r.t. clothes.

Material segmentation, i.e., dense per-pixel recognition of materials, remains challenging as, unlike objects, materials do not exhibit clearly discernible visual signatures in their regular RGB appearances. Different materials, however, do lead to different radiometric behaviors, which can often be captured with non-RGB imaging modalities. We realize multimodal material segmentation from RGB, polarization, and near-infrared images.

While they have played a major role in improving the performance of lane detection methods, the validity of this evaluation method in downstream tasks has not been adequately researched. In this study, we design 2 new driving-oriented metrics for lane detection: End-to-End Lateral Deviation metric (E2E-LD) is directly formulated based on the requirements of autonomous driving, a core task downstream of lane detection; Per-frame Simulated Lateral Deviation metric (PSLD) is a lightweight surrogate metric of E2E-LD. To evaluate the validity of the metrics, we conduct a large-scale empirical study with 4 major types of lane detection approaches on the TuSimple dataset and our newly constructed dataset Comma2k19-LD. Our results show that the conventional metrics have strongly negative correlations (<=-0.55) with E2E-LD, meaning that some recent improvements purely targeting the conventional metrics may not have led to meaningful improvements in autonomous driving, but rather may actually have made it worse by overfitting to the conventional metrics. On the contrary, PSLD shows statistically significant strong positive correlations (>=0.38) with E2E-LD. As a result, the conventional metrics tend to overestimate less robust models. As autonomous driving is a security/safety-critical system, the underestimation of robustness hinders the sound development of practical lane detection models.

Text2length involves sampling from the learned distribution function of motion lengths conditioned on the input text. This is followed by our text2motion module using temporal variational autoencoder to synthesize a diverse set of human motions of the sampled lengths.

Furthermore, these methods easily fail when the body parts are occluded by or interacting with the surrounding scene. To address the shortage of in-the-wild data, we collect a large-scale in-the-wild egocentric dataset called Egocentric Poses in the Wild (EgoPW).

JoinABLe uses the weak supervision available in standard parametric CAD files without the help of object class labels or human guidance. Our results show that by making network predictions over a graph representation of solid models we can outperform multiple baseline methods with an accuracy (79.53%) that approaches human performance (80%).

CVPR-2022-1695,CVPR,2022,REX: Reasoning-Aware and Grounded Explanation,"Shi Chen, Qi Zhao","Effectiveness and interpretability are two essential properties for trustworthy AI systems. Most recent studies in visual reasoning are dedicated to improving the accuracy of predicted answers, and less attention is paid to explaining the rationales behind the decisions. As a result, they commonly take advantage of spurious biases instead of actually reasoning on the visual-textual data, and have yet developed the capability to explain their decision making by considering key information from both modalities. This paper aims to close the gap from three distinct perspectives: first, we define a new type of multi-modal explanations that explain the decisions by progressively traversing the reasoning process and grounding keywords in the images. We develop a functional program to sequentially execute different reasoning steps and construct a new dataset with 1,040,830 multi-modal explanations. Second, we identify the critical need to tightly couple important components across the visual and textual modalities for explaining the decisions, and propose a novel explanation generation method that explicitly models the pairwise correspondence between words and regions of interest. It improves the visual grounding capability by a considerable margin, resulting in enhanced interpretability and reasoning performance. Finally, with our new data and method, we perform extensive analyses to study the effectiveness of our explanation under different settings, including multi-task learning and transfer learning.

Therefore, constructing a largescale 3D point clouds dataset is difficult. In order to remedy this issue, we propose a newly developed point cloud fractal database (PC-FractalDB), which is a novel family of formula-driven supervised learning inspired by fractal geometry encountered in natural 3D structures. Our research is based on the hypothesis that we could learn representations from more real-world 3D patterns than conventional 3D datasets by learning fractal geometry. We show how the PC-FractalDB facilitates solving several recent dataset-related problems in 3D scene understanding, such as 3D model collection and labor-intensive annotation. The experimental section shows how we achieved the performance rate of up to 61.9% and 59.0% for the ScanNetV2 and SUN RGB-D datasets, respectively, over the current highest scores obtained with the PointContrast, contrastive scene contexts (CSC), and RandomRooms. Moreover, the PC-FractalDB pre-trained model is especially effective in training with limited data. For example, in 10% of training data on ScanNetV2, the PC-FractalDB pre-trained VoteNet performs at 38.3%, which is +14.8% higher accuracy than CSC.

However, to create engaging video-content in movies and TV shows, the amount by which a camera can be moved while filming a particular shot is often limited. The resulting small-motion parallax between video frames makes standard geometry-based SfM approaches not as effective for movies and TV shows. To address this challenge, we propose a simple yet effective approach that uses single-frame depth-prior obtained from a pretrained network to significantly improve geometry-based SfM for our small-parallax setting. To this end, we first use the depth-estimates of the detected keypoints to reconstruct the point cloud and camera-pose for initial two-view reconstruction. We then perform depth-regularized optimization to register new images and triangulate the new points during incremental reconstruction. To comprehensively evaluate our approach, we introduce a new dataset (StudioSfM) consisting of 130 shots with 21K frames from 15 studio-produced videos that are manually annotated by a professional CG studio. We demonstrate that our approach: (a) significantly improves the quality of 3D reconstruction for our small-parallax setting, (b) does not cause any degradation for data with large-parallax, and (c) maintains the generalizability and scalability of geometry-based sparse SfM.

The challenges in reconstructing liquids, which is not faced in previous reconstruction works on rigid and deforming surfaces, lies in the inability to use depth sensing and color features due the variable index of refraction, opacity, and environmental reflections. Therefore, we limit ourselves to only surface detections (i.e. binary mask) of liquids as observations and do not assume any prior knowledge on the liquids properties. A novel optimization problem is posed which reconstructs the liquid as particles by minimizing the error between a rendered surface from the particles and the surface detections while satisfying liquid constraints. Our solvers to this optimization problem are presented and no training data is required to apply them. We also propose a dynamic prediction to seed the reconstruction optimization from the previous time-step.

The benefit of the inductive bias the network imposes in the DIP framework depends on the architecture. Therefore, researchers have studied how to automate the search to determine the best-performing model. However, common neural architecture search (NAS) techniques are resource and time-intensive. Moreover, best-performing models are determined for a whole dataset of images instead of for each image independently, which would be prohibitively expensive. In this work, we first show that optimal neural architectures in the DIP framework are image-dependent. Leveraging this insight, we then propose an image-specific NAS strategy for the DIP framework that requires substantially less training than typical NAS approaches, effectively enabling image-specific NAS. We justify the proposed strategy's effectiveness by (1) demonstrating its performance on a NAS Dataset for DIP that includes 522 models from a particular search space (2) conducting extensive experiments on image denoising, inpainting, and super-resolution tasks. Our experiments show that image-specific metrics can reduce the search space to a small cohort of models, of which the best model outperforms current NAS approaches for image restoration.

Towards this goal, we construct a new fine-grained dataset, called FineDiving, developed on diverse diving events with detailed annotations on action procedures.

Previous methods either rely on manual visual checking or RGB image-based inspection algorithm, requiring costly preparation procedures (e.g., open the bag and spread the waste items). Moreover, occluded items are very likely to be left out. Inspired by the fact that X-ray has a strong penetrating power to see through the bag and overlapping objects, we propose to perform waste inspection efficiently using X-ray images without the need to open the bag. We introduce a novel problem of instance-level waste segmentation in X-ray image for intelligent waste inspection, and contribute a real dataset consisting of 5,038 X-ray images (totally 30,881 waste items) with high-quality annotations (i.e., waste categories, object boxes, and instance-level masks) as a benchmark for this problem. As existing segmentation methods are mainly designed for natural images and cannot take advantage of the characteristics of X-ray waste images (e.g., heavy occlusions and penetration effect), we propose a new instance segmentation method to explicitly take these image characteristics into account. Specifically, our method adopts an easy-to-hard disassembling strategy to use high confidence predictions to guide the segmentation of highly overlapped objects, and a global structure guidance module to better capture the complex contour information caused by the penetration effect.

The contributions of this work are threefold. First, we develop a self-supervised model for jointly learning state-modifying actions together with the corresponding object states from an uncurated set of videos from the Internet. The model is self-supervised by the causal ordering signal, i.e. initial object state -> manipulating action -> end state. Second, to cope with noisy uncurated training data, our model incorporates a noise adaptive weighting module supervised by a small number of annotated still images, that allows to efficiently filter out irrelevant videos during training.

However, the richness of data comes at the expense of fundamental challenges such as abrupt shot changes and close up shots of actors with heavy truncation, which limits the applicability of existing 3D human understanding methods. In this paper, we address these limitations with the insight that while shot changes of the same scene incur a discontinuity between frames, the 3D structure of the scene still changes smoothly. This allows us to handle frames before and after the shot change as multi-view signal that provide strong cues to recover the 3D state of the actors. We propose a multi-shot optimization framework that realizes this insight, leading to improved 3D reconstruction and mining of sequences with pseudo-ground truth 3D human mesh.

We present a weakly supervised method that is able to decompose a single image of an object into shape (depth and normals), material (albedo, reflectivity and shininess) and global lighting parameters.

At the heart of the problem are the inefficiencies of the waste sorting process (separating paper, plastic, metal, glass, etc.) due to the extremely complex and cluttered nature of the waste stream. Recyclable waste detection poses a unique computer vision challenge as it requires detection of highly deformable and often translucent objects in cluttered scenes without the kind of context information usually present in human-centric datasets. This challenging computer vision task currently lacks suitable datasets or methods in the available literature. In this paper, we take a step towards computer-aided waste detection and present the first in-the-wild industrial-grade waste detection and segmentation dataset, ZeroWaste.

However, it remains unclear which types of compositional reasoning cause models to mispredict.

In this paper, we develop a question decomposition engine that programmatically deconstructs a compositional question into a directed acyclic graph of sub-questions. The graph is designed such that each parent question is a composition of its children. We present AGQA-Decomp, a benchmark containing 2.3M question graphs, with an average of 11.49 sub-questions per graph, and 4.55M total new sub-questions.

In this work, we propose MUSE-VAE, a new probabilistic modeling framework based on a cascade of Conditional VAEs, which tackles the long-term, uncertain trajectory prediction task using a coarse-to-fine multi-factor forecasting architecture. In its Macro stage, the model learns a joint pixel-space representation of two key factors, the underlying environment and the agent movements, to predict the long and short term motion goals. Conditioned on them, the Micro stage learns a fine-grained spatio-temporal representation for the prediction of individual agent trajectories. The VAE backbones across the two stages make it possible to naturally account for the joint uncertainty at both levels of granularity.

Black","Given an image with multiple people, our goal is to directly regress the pose and shape of all the people as well as their relative depth. Inferring the depth of a person in an image, however, is fundamentally ambiguous without knowing their height. This is particularly problematic when the scene contains people of very different sizes, e.g. from infants to adults. To solve this, we need several things. First, we develop a novel method to infer the poses and depth of multiple people in a single image. While previous work that estimates multiple people does so by reasoning in the image plane, our method, called BEV, adds an additional imaginary Bird's-Eye-View representation to explicitly reason about depth. BEV reasons simultaneously about body centers in the image and in depth and, by combing these, estimates 3D body position. Unlike prior work, BEV is a single-shot method that is end-to-end differentiable. Second, height varies with age, making it impossible to resolve depth without also estimating the age of people in the image. To do so, we exploit a 3D body model space that lets BEV infer shapes from infants to adults. Third, to train BEV, we need a new dataset. Specifically, we create a ""Relative Human"" (RH) dataset that includes age labels and relative depth relationships between the people in the images. Extensive experiments on RH and AGORA demonstrate the effectiveness of the model and training scheme. BEV outperforms existing methods on depth reasoning, child shape estimation, and robustness to occlusion.

While deep learning approach shows great promise in solving image restoration problems, defocus deblurring demands accurate training data that consists of all-in-focus and defocus image pairs, which is difficult to collect. Naive two-shot capturing cannot achieve pixel-wise correspondence between the defocused and all-in-focus image pairs. Synthetic aperture of light fields is suggested to be a more reliable way to generate accurate image pairs. However, the defocus blur generated from light field data is different from that of the images captured with a traditional digital camera. In this paper, we propose a novel deep defocus deblurring network that leverages the strength and overcomes the shortcoming of light fields. We first train the network on a light field-generated dataset for its highly accurate image correspondence. Then, we fine-tune the network using feature loss on another dataset collected by the two-shot method to alleviate the differences between the defocus blur exists in the two domains.

Prior work on human motion prediction estimates future poses at fixed time intervals. Although easy to define, this frame-by-frame formulation confounds temporal and intentional aspects of human action. Instead, we define a semantically meaningful pose prediction task that decouples the predicted pose from time, taking inspiration from goal-directed behavior. To predict characteristic poses, we propose a probabilistic approach that models the possible multi-modality in the distribution of likely characteristic poses.

Near-perfect accuracy on benchmarks is common, but these models do not work as expected when deployed outside of the training distribution. To build computer vision systems that truly solve real-world problems at global scale, we need benchmarks that fully capture real-world complexity, including geographic domain shift, long-tailed distributions, and data noise. We propose urban forest monitoring as an ideal testbed for studying and improving upon these computer vision challenges, while simultaneously working towards filling a crucial environmental and societal need. Urban forests provide significant benefits to urban societies (e.g., cleaner air and water, carbon sequestration, and energy savings among others). However, planning and maintaining these forests is expensive. One particularly costly aspect of urban forest management is monitoring the existing trees in a city: e.g., tracking tree locations, species, and health. Monitoring efforts are currently based on tree censuses built by human experts, costing cities millions of dollars per census and thus collected infrequently. Previous investigations into automating urban forest monitoring focused on small datasets from single cities, covering only common categories. To address these shortcomings, we introduce a new large-scale dataset that joins public tree censuses from 23 cities with a large collection of street level and aerial imagery. Our Auto Arborist dataset contains over 2.5M trees and 344 genera and is >2 orders of magnitude larger than the closest dataset in the literature.

However, they can be strongly biased by non-relevant factors implicitly incorporated in the training data. These include operational biases, such as ineffective or uneven data sampling, but also ethical concerns, as the social biases are implicitly present--even inadvertently, in the training data or explicitly defined in unfair training schedules. In tasks having impact on human processes, the learning of social biases may produce discriminatory, unethical and untrustworthy consequences. It is often assumed that social biases stem from supervised learning on labelled data, and thus, Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) wrongly appears as an efficient and bias-free solution, as it does not require labelled data. However, it was recently proven that a popular SSL method also incorporates biases. In this paper, we study the biases of a varied set of SSL visual models, trained using ImageNet data, using a method and dataset designed by psychological experts to measure social biases. We show that there is a correlation between the type of the SSL model and the number of biases that it incorporates. Furthermore, the results also suggest that this number does not strictly depend on the model's accuracy and changes throughout the network.

Additionally, computer vision and graphics methods that predict skeletons are typically heuristic, not learned from data, do not leverage the full 3D body surface, and are not validated against ground truth. To our knowledge, our system, called OSSO (Obtaining Skeletal Shape from Outside), is the first to learn the mapping from the 3D body surface to the internal skeleton from real data. We do so using 1000 male and 1000 female dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans. To these, we fit a parametric 3D body shape model (STAR) to capture the body surface and a novel part-based 3D skeleton model to capture the bones. This provides inside/outside training pairs. We model the statistical variation of full skeletons using PCA in a pose-normalized space and train a regressor from body shape parameters to skeleton shape parameters. Given an arbitrary 3D body shape and pose, OSSO predicts a realistic skeleton inside.

To create VEOs, we built a multi-view capture system that captures objects under the influence of a compressed air stream. Building on recent advances in model-free, dynamic Neural Radiance Fields, we reconstruct the objects and corresponding deformation fields.

Recent progress in dynamic video depth prediction has focused on improving the output of monocular depth estimators by means of multi-view constraints while imposing little to no restrictions on the deformation of the dynamic parts of the scene. However, the theory of Non-Rigid Structure from Motion prescribes to constrain the deformations for 3D reconstruction. We thus propose a new model that departs significantly from this prior work. The idea is to fit a dynamic point cloud to the video data using Sinkhorn's algorithm to associate the 3D points to 2D pixels and use a differentiable point renderer to ensure the compatibility of the 3D deformations with the measured optical flow. In this manner, our algorithm, called Keypoint Transporter, models the overall deformation of the object within the entire video, so it can constrain the reconstruction correspondingly. Compared to weaker deformation models, this significantly reduces the reconstruction ambiguity and, for dynamic objects, allows Keypoint Transporter to obtain reconstructions of the quality superior or at least comparable to prior approaches while being much faster and reliant on a pre-trained monocular depth estimator network.

Existing approaches utilize appearance cues, such as color, texture, and location, to group pixels into object-like regions. However, by relying on appearance alone, these methods fail to separate objects from the background in cluttered scenes. This is a fundamental limitation since the definition of an object is inherently ambiguous and context-dependent. To resolve this ambiguity, we choose to focus on dynamic objects -- entities that can move independently in the world. We then scale the recent auto-encoder based frameworks for unsupervised object discovery from toy synthetic images to complex real-world scenes. To this end, we simplify their architecture, and augment the resulting model with a weak learning signal from general motion segmentation algorithms. Our experiments demonstrate that, despite only capturing a small subset of the objects that move, this signal is enough to generalize to segment both moving and static instances of dynamic objects. We show that our model scales to a newly collected, photo-realistic synthetic dataset with street driving scenarios. Additionally, we leverage ground truth segmentation and flow annotations in this dataset for thorough ablation and evaluation. Finally, our experiments on the real-world KITTI benchmark demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms both heuristic- and learning-based methods by capitalizing on motion cues.",True,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2022/papers/Hong_Unsupervised_Homography_Estimation_With_Coplanarity-Aware_GAN_CVPR_2022_paper.pdf

However, the existing methods mainly exploit the literal meaning of scene text for fine-grained recognition, which might be irrelevant when it is not significantly related to objects/scenes. We propose an end-to-end trainable network that mines implicit contextual knowledge behind scene text image and enhance the semantics and correlation to fine-tune the image representation. Unlike the existing methods, our model integrates three modalities: visual feature extraction, text semantics extraction, and correlating background knowledge to fine-grained image classification.

We introduce the task of semantic action-conditional video prediction, which uses semantic action labels to describe those interactions and can be regarded as an inverse problem of action recognition. The challenge of this new task primarily lies in how to effectively inform the model of semantic action information.

However, synthesized persons in existing datasets are mostly cartoon-like and in random dress collocation, which limits their performance. To address this, in this work, an automatic approach is proposed to directly clone the whole outfits from real-world person images to virtual 3D characters, such that any virtual person thus created will appear very similar to its real-world counterpart. Specifically, based on UV texture mapping, two cloning methods are designed, namely registered clothes mapping and homogeneous cloth expansion. Given clothes keypoints detected on person images and labeled on regular UV maps with clear clothes structures, registered mapping applies perspective homography to warp real-world clothes to the counterparts on the UV map. As for invisible clothes parts and irregular UV maps, homogeneous expansion segments a homogeneous area on clothes as a realistic cloth pattern or cell, and expand the cell to fill the UV map. Furthermore, a similarity-diversity expansion strategy is proposed, by clustering person images, sampling images per cluster, and cloning outfits for 3D character generation. This way, virtual persons can be scaled up densely in visual similarity to challenge model learning, and diversely in population to enrich sample distribution. Finally, by rendering the cloned characters in Unity3D scenes, a more realistic virtual dataset called ClonedPerson is created, with 5,621 identities and 887,766 images. Experimental results show that the model trained on ClonedPerson has a better generalization performance, superior to that trained on other popular real-world and synthetic person re-identification datasets.

However, it has also been shown that VL models are still brittle in Structured VL Concept (SVLC) reasoning, such as the ability to recognize object attributes, states, and inter-object relations. This leads to reasoning mistakes, which need to be corrected as they occur by teaching VL models the missing SVLC skills; often this must be done using private data where the issue was found, which naturally leads to a data-free continual (no task-id) VL learning setting. In this work, we introduce the first Continual Data-Free Structured VL Concepts Learning (ConStruct-VL) benchmark and show it is challenging for many existing data-free CL strategies. We, therefore, propose a data-free method comprised of a new approach of Adversarial Pseudo-Replay (APR) which generates adversarial reminders of past tasks from past task models. To use this method efficiently, we also propose a continual parameter-efficient Layered-LoRA (LaLo) neural architecture allowing no-memory-cost access to all past models at train time.

However, visual cameras neglect human 3D structure information, which limits the feasibility of gait recognition in the 3D wild world. Instead of extracting gait features from images, this work explores precise 3D gait features from point clouds and proposes a simple yet efficient 3D gait recognition framework, termed LidarGait. Our proposed approach projects sparse point clouds into depth maps to learn the representations with 3D geometry information, which outperforms existing point-wise and camera-based methods by a significant margin. Due to the lack of point cloud datasets, we build the first large-scale LiDAR-based gait recognition dataset, SUSTech1K, collected by a LiDAR sensor and an RGB camera.

The increasing frame rate is usually guaranteed by using shorter exposure time so that the captured video is severely interfered by noise. Alternating exposures could alleviate the noise issue but sacrifice frame rate due to involving long-exposure frames. The neuromorphic spiking camera records high-speed scenes of high dynamic range without colors using a completely different sensing mechanism and visual representation. We introduce a hybrid camera system composed of a spiking and an alternating-exposure RGB camera to capture HFR&HDR scenes with high fidelity. Our insight is to bring each camera's superiority into full play. The spike frames, with accurate fast motion information encoded, are first reconstructed for motion representation, from which the spike-based optical flows guide the recovery of missing temporal information for middle- and long-exposure RGB images while retaining their reliable color appearances. With the strong temporal constraint estimated from spike trains, both missing and distorted colors cross RGB frames are recovered to generate time-consistent and HFR color frames.

However, manually creating or re-creating real-world-like environments is difficult, expensive, and not scalable. Recent generative model techniques have shown promising progress to address such challenges by learning 3D assets using only plentiful 2D images -- but still suffer limitations as they leverage either human-curated image datasets or renderings from manually-created synthetic 3D environments. In this paper, we introduce GINA-3D, a generative model that uses real-world driving data from camera and LiDAR sensors to create photo-realistic 3D implicit neural assets of diverse vehicles and pedestrians.

Unlike the conventional RGB-guided depth enhancement approaches which perform the fusion in a per-frame manner, we propose the first multi-frame fusion scheme to mitigate the spatial ambiguity resulting from the low-resolution dToF imaging. In addition, dToF sensors provide unique depth histogram information for each local patch, and we incorporate this dToF-specific feature in our network design to further alleviate spatial ambiguity.

However, their studies on knowledge transfer from known classes to unknown ones are not deep enough, resulting in the scanty capability for detecting unknowns hidden in the background. In this paper, we propose the unknown sniffer (UnSniffer) to find both unknown and known objects. Firstly, the generalized object confidence (GOC) score is introduced, which only uses known samples for supervision and avoids improper suppression of unknowns in the background. Significantly, such confidence score learned from known objects can be generalized to unknown ones. Additionally, we propose a negative energy suppression loss to further suppress the non-object samples in the background. Next, the best box of each unknown is hard to obtain during inference due to lacking their semantic information in training. To solve this issue, we introduce a graph-based determination scheme to replace hand-designed non-maximum suppression (NMS) post-processing.

It can be viewed as one type of data augmentation technique, which can inject commonsense knowledge into existing VL datasets on the fly during training. More specifically, we leverage the commonsense knowledge graph (e.g., ConceptNet) and create variants of text description in VL datasets via bidirectional sub-graph sequentialization. For better commonsense evaluation, we further propose the first retrieval-based commonsense diagnostic benchmark. By conducting extensive experiments on some representative VL-models, we demonstrate that our DANCE technique is able to significantly improve the commonsense ability while maintaining the performance on vanilla retrieval tasks.",True,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/papers/Park_BiFormer_Learning_Bilateral_Motion_Estimation_via_Bilateral_Transformer_for_4K_CVPR_2023_paper.pdf

In crowded human scenes with close-up human-robot interaction and robot navigation, a deep understanding of surrounding people requires reasoning about human motion and body dynamics over time with human body pose estimation and tracking. However, existing datasets captured from robot platforms either do not provide pose annotations or do not reflect the scene distribution of social robots. In this paper, we introduce JRDB-Pose, a large-scale dataset and benchmark for multi-person pose estimation and tracking. JRDB-Pose extends the existing JRDB which includes videos captured from a social navigation robot in a university campus environment, containing challenging scenes with crowded indoor and outdoor locations and a diverse range of scales and occlusion types. JRDB-Pose provides human pose annotations with per-keypoint occlusion labels and track IDs consistent across the scene and with existing annotations in JRDB.

However, these models suffer from societal biases owing to the skewed distribution of various identity groups in the training data. These biases manifest as the skewed similarity between the representations for specific text concepts and images of people of different identity groups and, therefore, limit the usefulness of such models in real-world high-stakes applications. In this work, we present DeAR (Debiasing with Additive Residuals), a novel debiasing method that learns additive residual image representations to offset the original representations, ensuring fair output representations. In doing so, it reduces the ability of the representations to distinguish between the different identity groups. Further, we observe that the current fairness tests are performed on limited face image datasets that fail to indicate why a specific text concept should/should not apply to them. To bridge this gap and better evaluate DeAR, we introduce a new context-based bias benchmarking dataset - the Protected Attribute Tag Association (PATA) dataset for evaluating the fairness of large pre-trained VLMs. Additionally, PATA provides visual context for a diverse human population in different scenarios with both positive and negative connotations.

In 3D, existing benchmarks are small in size and approaches specialize in few object categories and specific domains, e.g. urban driving scenes. Motivated by the success of 2D recognition, we revisit the task of 3D object detection by introducing a large benchmark, called Omni3D. Omni3D re-purposes and combines existing datasets resulting in 234k images annotated with more than 3 million instances and 98 categories. 3D detection at such scale is challenging due to variations in camera intrinsics and the rich diversity of scene and object types.

Previous works address this problem under the tenuous assumption that only a single shortcut exists in the training data. Real-world images are rife with multiple visual cues from background to texture. Key to advancing the reliability of vision systems is understanding whether existing methods can overcome multiple shortcuts or struggle in a Whac-A-Mole game, i.e., where mitigating one shortcut amplifies reliance on others. To address this shortcoming, we propose two benchmarks: 1) UrbanCars, a dataset with precisely controlled spurious cues, and 2) ImageNet-W, an evaluation set based on ImageNet for watermark, a shortcut we discovered affects nearly every modern vision model. Along with texture and background, ImageNet-W allows us to study multiple shortcuts emerging from training on natural images. We find computer vision models, including large foundation models---regardless of training set, architecture, and supervision---struggle when multiple shortcuts are present. Even methods explicitly designed to combat shortcuts struggle in a Whac-A-Mole dilemma. To tackle this challenge, we propose Last Layer Ensemble, a simple-yet-effective method to mitigate multiple shortcuts without Whac-A-Mole behavior.

The main limitations of existing device model lie in: (1) unable to update due to the computation limit of the device, (2) limited generalization ability of the lightweight model. Meanwhile, recent large models have shown strong generalization capability on cloud while they can not be deployed on client devices due to the poor computation constraint. To enable the device model to deal with changing environments, we propose a new learning paradigm of Cloud-Device Collaborative Continual Adaptation. To encourage collaboration between cloud and device and improve the generalization of device model, we propose an Uncertainty-based Visual Prompt Adapted (U-VPA) teacher-student model in such paradigm. Specifically, we first design the Uncertainty Guided Sampling (UGS) to screen out challenging data continuously and transmit the most out-of-distribution samples from the device to the cloud.

Then, we transmit the visual prompts to the device and concatenate them with the incoming data to pull the device testing distribution closer to the cloud training distribution.

Zhang, Francesco Ferroni, Deva Ramanan","We extend neural radiance fields (NeRFs) to dynamic large-scale urban scenes. Prior work tends to reconstruct single video clips of short durations (up to 10 seconds). Two reasons are that such methods (a) tend to scale linearly with the number of moving objects and input videos because a separate model is built for each and (b) tend to require supervision via 3D bounding boxes and panoptic labels, obtained manually or via category-specific models. As a step towards truly open-world reconstructions of dynamic cities, we introduce two key innovations: (a) we factorize the scene into three separate hash table data structures to efficiently encode static, dynamic, and far-field radiance fields, and (b) we make use of unlabeled target signals consisting of RGB images, sparse LiDAR, off-the-shelf self-supervised 2D descriptors, and most importantly, 2D optical flow. Operationalizing such inputs via photometric, geometric, and feature-metric reconstruction losses enables SUDS to decompose dynamic scenes into the static background, individual objects, and their motions. When combined with our multi-branch table representation, such reconstructions can be scaled to tens of thousands of objects across 1.2 million frames from 1700 videos spanning geospatial footprints of hundreds of kilometers, (to our knowledge) the largest dynamic NeRF built to date.

Automatic recognition of animals and their behaviors is critical for capitalizing on the large unlabeled datasets generated by modern video devices and for accelerating monitoring efforts at scale.

Existing video datasets 1) do not classify animals according to established biological taxonomies; 2) are too small to facilitate large-scale behavioral studies and are often limited to a single species; and 3) do not feature temporally localized annotations and therefore do not facilitate localization of targeted behaviors within longer video sequences.

Besides, the uncontrollable data collection process produces non-IID training and test data, where undesired duplication may exist. All these nuisances may hinder the verification of typical theories and exposure to new findings. To circumvent them, an alternative is to generate synthetic data via 3D rendering with domain randomization. We in this work push forward along this line by doing profound and extensive research on bare supervised learning and downstream domain adaptation. Specifically, under the well-controlled, IID data setting enabled by 3D rendering, we systematically verify the typical, important learning insights, e.g., shortcut learning, and discover the new laws of various data regimes and network architectures in generalization. We further investigate the effect of image formation factors on generalization, e.g., object scale, material texture, illumination, camera viewpoint, and background in a 3D scene.

First, we propose a text-synthesis approach that relies on an analogy-based prompting procedure to generate natural language music descriptions from a large-scale language model (BLOOM-176B) given pre-trained music tagger outputs and a small number of human text descriptions. Second, we use these synthesized music descriptions to train a new trimodal model, which fuses text and video input representations to query music samples.

Our model design allows for the retrieved music audio to agree with the two input modalities by matching visual style depicted in the video and musical genre, mood, or instrumentation described in the natural language query. Third, to evaluate our approach, we collect a testing dataset for our problem by annotating a subset of 4k clips from the YT8M-MusicVideo dataset with natural language music descriptions which we make publicly available.

Most of the previous approaches utilize the entire features or object-centric features to represent navigable candidates. However, these representations are not efficient enough for an agent to perform actions to arrive the target location. As knowledge provides crucial information which is complementary to visible content, in this paper, we propose a Knowledge Enhanced Reasoning Model (KERM) to leverage knowledge to improve agent navigation ability. Specifically, we first retrieve facts (i.e., knowledge described by language descriptions) for the navigation views based on local regions from the constructed knowledge base. The retrieved facts range from properties of a single object (e.g., color, shape) to relationships between objects (e.g., action, spatial position), providing crucial information for VLN.

However, there exists no robust method to detect contact between the body and the scene from an image, and there exists no dataset to learn such a detector. We fill this gap with HOT (""Human-Object conTact""), a new dataset of human-object contacts in images. To build HOT, we use two data sources: (1) We use the PROX dataset of 3D human meshes moving in 3D scenes, and automatically annotate 2D image areas for contact via 3D mesh proximity and projection. (2) We use the V-COCO, HAKE and Watch-n-Patch datasets, and ask trained annotators to draw polygons around the 2D image areas where contact takes place. We also annotate the involved body part of the human body. We use our HOT dataset to train a new contact detector, which takes a single color image as input, and outputs 2D contact heatmaps as well as the body-part labels that are in contact. This is a new and challenging task, that extends current foot-ground or hand-object contact detectors to the full generality of the whole body. The detector uses a part-attention branch to guide contact estimation through the context of the surrounding body parts and scene.

Rosin","Image aesthetics assessment (IAA) is a challenging task due to its highly subjective nature. Most of the current studies rely on large-scale datasets (e.g., AVA and AADB) to learn a general model for all kinds of photography images. However, little light has been shed on measuring the aesthetic quality of artistic images, and the existing datasets only contain relatively few artworks. Such a defect is a great obstacle to the aesthetic assessment of artistic images. To fill the gap in the field of artistic image aesthetics assessment (AIAA), we first introduce a large-scale AIAA dataset: Boldbrush Artistic Image Dataset (BAID), which consists of 60,337 artistic images covering various art forms, with more than 360,000 votes from online users. We then propose a new method, SAAN (Style-specific Art Assessment Network), which can effectively extract and utilize style-specific and generic aesthetic information to evaluate artistic images. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms existing IAA methods on the proposed BAID dataset according to quantitative comparisons. We believe the proposed dataset and method can serve as a foundation for future AIAA works and inspire more research in this field.",True,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/papers/Voigtlaender_Connecting_Vision_and_Language_With_Video_Localized_Narratives_CVPR_2023_paper.pdf

To solve these problems, we propose in this paper an Unsupervised Symmetric Shape-Preserving Autoencoding Network, termed USSPA, to predict complete point clouds of objects from real scenes. One of our main observations is that many natural and man-made objects exhibit significant symmetries. To accommodate this, we devise a symmetry learning module to learn from those objects and to preserve structural symmetries. Starting from an initial coarse predictor, our autoencoder refines the complete shape with a carefully designed upsampling refinement module. Besides the discriminative process on the latent space, the discriminators of our USSPA also take predicted point clouds as direct guidance, enabling more detailed shape prediction. Clearly different from previous methods which train each category separately, our USSPA can be adapted to the training of multi-category data in one pass through a classifier-guided discriminator, with consistent performance on single category. For more accurate evaluation, we contribute to the community a real scene dataset with paired CAD models as ground truth.

However, this setting is unrealistic as natural videos often contain numerous audio-visual events with different categories. To better adapt to real-life applications, in this paper we focus on the task of dense-localizing audio-visual events, which aims to jointly localize and recognize all audio-visual events occurring in an untrimmed video. The problem is challenging as it requires fine-grained audio-visual scene and context understanding. To tackle this problem, we introduce the first Untrimmed Audio-Visual (UnAV-100) dataset, which contains 10K untrimmed videos with over 30K audio-visual events.

This has inspired research endeavors utilizing events to guide the challenging video super-resolution (VSR) task. In this paper, we make the first at tempt to address a novel problem of achieving VSR at random scales by taking advantages of the high temporal resolution property of events. This is hampered by the difficulties of representing the spatial-temporal information of events when guiding VSR. To this end, we propose a novel framework that incorporates the spatial-temporal interpolation of events to VSR in a unified framework. Our key idea is to learn implicit neural representations from queried spatial-temporal coordinates and features from both RGB frames and events. Our method contains three parts. Specifically, the Spatial-Temporal Fusion (STF) module first learns the 3D features from events and RGB frames. Then, the Temporal Filter (TF) module unlocks more explicit motion information from the events near the queried timestamp and generates the 2D features. Lastly, the Spatial-Temporal Implicit Representation (STIR) module recovers the SR frame in arbitrary resolutions from the outputs of these two modules. In addition, we collect a real-world dataset with spatially aligned events and RGB frames.

Prior work usually requires specific guidance such as the flickering frequency, manual annotations, or extra consistent videos to remove the flicker. In this work, we propose a general flicker removal framework that only receives a single flickering video as input without additional guidance. Since it is blind to a specific flickering type or guidance, we name this ""blind deflickering."" The core of our approach is utilizing the neural atlas in cooperation with a neural filtering strategy. The neural atlas is a unified representation for all frames in a video that provides temporal consistency guidance but is flawed in many cases. To this end, a neural network is trained to mimic a filter to learn the consistent features (e.g., color, brightness) and avoid introducing the artifacts in the atlas.

It involves generating multiple images of same subjects under different factors (e.g., variations in pose, illumination, expression, aging and occlusion) which follows the real image conditional distribution. Previous works have studied the generation of synthetic datasets using GAN or 3D models. In this work, we approach the problem from the aspect of combining subject appearance (ID) and external factor (style) conditions. These two conditions provide a direct way to control the inter-class and intra-class variations. To this end, we propose a Dual Condition Face Generator (DCFace) based on a diffusion model.

In this work, we revisit the classic stereo setup for training data collection -- capturing two images of the same scene with one UDC and one standard camera. The key idea is to ""copy"" details from a high-quality reference image and ""paste"" them on the UDC image. While being able to generate real training pairs, this setting is susceptible to spatial misalignment due to perspective and depth of field changes. The problem is further compounded by the large domain discrepancy between the UDC and normal images, which is unique to UDC restoration. In this paper, we mitigate the non-trivial domain discrepancy and spatial misalignment through a novel Transformer-based framework that generates well-aligned yet high-quality target data for the corresponding UDC input. This is made possible through two carefully designed components, namely, the Domain Alignment Module (DAM) and Geometric Alignment Module (GAM), which encourage robust and accurate discovery of correspondence between the UDC and normal views.

Specifically, UNIReID incorporates a simple dual-encoder with task-specific modality learning to mine and fuse visual and textual modality information. To deal with the imbalanced training problem of different tasks in UNIReID, we propose a task-aware dynamic training strategy in terms of task difficulty, adaptively adjusting the training focus. Besides, we construct three multi-modal ReID datasets by collecting the corresponding sketches from photos to support this challenging task. The experimental results on three multi-modal ReID datasets show that our UNIReID greatly improves the retrieval accuracy and generalization ability on different tasks and unseen scenarios.",True,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/papers/Ma_DiGeo_Discriminative_Geometry-Aware_Learning_for_Generalized_Few-Shot_Object_Detection_CVPR_2023_paper.pdf

Tran, Anh Nguyen","Music-driven choreography is a challenging problem with a wide variety of industrial applications. Recently, many methods have been proposed to synthesize dance motions from music for a single dancer. However, generating dance motion for a group remains an open problem. In this paper, we present AIOZ-GDANCE, a new largescale dataset for music-driven group dance generation. Unlike existing datasets that only support single dance, our new dataset contains group dance videos, hence supporting the study of group choreography. We propose a semiautonomous labeling method with humans in the loop to obtain the 3D ground truth for our dataset. The proposed dataset consists of 16.7 hours of paired music and 3D motion from in-the-wild videos, covering 7 dance styles and 16 music genres. We show that naively applying single dance generation technique to creating group dance motion may lead to unsatisfactory results, such as inconsistent movements and collisions between dancers. Based on our new dataset, we propose a new method that takes an input music sequence and a set of 3D positions of dancers to efficiently produce multiple group-coherent choreographies. We propose new evaluation metrics for measuring group dance quality and perform intensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

Yuille, Li Cheng","Robust and reliable semantic segmentation in complex scenes is crucial for many real-life applications such as autonomous safe driving and nighttime rescue. In most approaches, it is typical to make use of RGB images as input. They however work well only in preferred weather conditions; when facing adverse conditions such as rainy, overexposure, or low-light, they often fail to deliver satisfactory results. This has led to the recent investigation into multispectral semantic segmentation, where RGB and thermal infrared (RGBT) images are both utilized as input. This gives rise to significantly more robust segmentation of image objects in complex scenes and under adverse conditions. Nevertheless, the present focus in single RGBT image input restricts existing methods from well addressing dynamic real-world scenes. Motivated by the above observations, in this paper, we set out to address a relatively new task of semantic segmentation of multispectral video input, which we refer to as Multispectral Video Semantic Segmentation, or MVSS in short. An in-house MVSeg dataset is thus curated, consisting of 738 calibrated RGB and thermal videos, accompanied by 3,545 fine-grained pixel-level semantic annotations of 26 categories. Our dataset contains a wide range of challenging urban scenes in both daytime and nighttime. Moreover, we propose an effective MVSS baseline, dubbed MVNet, which is to our knowledge the first model to jointly learn semantic representations from multispectral and temporal contexts. Comprehensive experiments are conducted using various semantic segmentation models on the MVSeg dataset. Empirically, the engagement of multispectral video input is shown to lead to significant improvement in semantic segmentation; the effectiveness of our MVNet baseline has also been verified.",True,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/papers/Shim_Diffusion-Based_Signed_Distance_Fields_for_3D_Shape_Generation_CVPR_2023_paper.pdf

We build a novel RAW sensor dataset, named ROD, for Deep Neural Networks (DNNs)-based object detection algorithms to be applied to HDR data. The ROD dataset contains a large amount of annotated instances of day and night driving scenes in 24-bit dynamic range. Based on the dataset, we first investigate the impact of dynamic range for DNNs-based detectors and demonstrate the importance of dynamic range adjustment for detection on RAW sensor data. Then, we propose a simple and effective adjustment method for object detection on HDR RAW sensor data, which is image adaptive and jointly optimized with the downstream detector in an end-to-end scheme. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the performance of detection on RAW sensor data is significantly superior to standard dynamic range (SDR) data in different situations.

However, most methods are currently limited to one of the following: specific editing types (e.g., object overlay, style transfer), synthetically generated images, or requiring multiple input images of a common object. In this paper we demonstrate, for the very first time, the ability to apply complex (e.g., non-rigid) text-based semantic edits to a single real image. For example, we can change the posture and composition of one or multiple objects inside an image, while preserving its original characteristics. Our method can make a standing dog sit down, cause a bird to spread its wings, etc. -- each within its single high-resolution user-provided natural image. Contrary to previous work, our proposed method requires only a single input image and a target text (the desired edit). It operates on real images, and does not require any additional inputs (such as image masks or additional views of the object). Our method, called Imagic, leverages a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model for this task. It produces a text embedding that aligns with both the input image and the target text, while fine-tuning the diffusion model to capture the image-specific appearance. We demonstrate the quality and versatility of Imagic on numerous inputs from various domains, showcasing a plethora of high quality complex semantic image edits, all within a single unified framework. To better assess performance, we introduce TEdBench, a highly challenging image editing benchmark.

Localization algorithms compute the camera pose of a query image w.r.t. a scene representation, which is typically built from images. This often requires capturing and storing large amounts of data, followed by running Structure-from-Motion (SfM) algorithms. An interesting, and underexplored, source of data for building scene representations are 3D models that are readily available on the Internet, e.g., hand-drawn CAD models, 3D models generated from building footprints, or from aerial images. These models allow to perform visual localization right away without the time-consuming scene capturing and model building steps. Yet, it also comes with challenges as the available 3D models are often imperfect reflections of reality. E.g., the models might only have generic or no textures at all, might only provide a simple approximation of the scene geometry, or might be stretched. This paper studies how the imperfections of these models affect localization accuracy. We create a new benchmark for this task and provide a detailed experimental evaluation based on multiple 3D models per scene.

To achieve this goal, we create a toolkit for object editing with controls of backgrounds, sizes, positions, and directions, and create a rigorous benchmark named ImageNet-E(diting) for evaluating the image classifier robustness in terms of object attributes. With our ImageNet-E, we evaluate the performance of current deep learning models, including both convolutional neural networks and vision transformers.

Trained on our synthesized large-scale dexterous grasp dataset, this model enables us to sample diverse and high-quality dexterous grasp poses for the object point cloud. For the second stage, we propose to replace the motion planning used in parallel gripper grasping with a goal-conditioned grasp policy, due to the complexity involved in dexterous grasping execution. Note that it is very challenging to learn this highly generalizable grasp policy that only takes realistic inputs without oracle states. We thus propose several important innovations, including state canonicalization, object curriculum, and teacher-student distillation.

While IID is typically solved through supervised learning methods, it is not ideal due to the difficulty in observing ground truth albedo and shade in general scenes. Conversely, unsupervised learning methods are currently underperforming supervised learning methods since there are no criteria for solving the ill-posed problems. Recently, light detection and ranging (LiDAR) is widely used due to its ability to make highly precise distance measurements. Thus, we have focused on the utilization of LiDAR, especially LiDAR intensity, to address this issue. In this paper, we propose unsupervised intrinsic image decomposition with LiDAR intensity (IID-LI). Since the conventional unsupervised learning methods consist of image-to-image transformations, simply inputting LiDAR intensity is not an effective approach. Therefore, we design an intensity consistency loss that computes the error between LiDAR intensity and gray-scaled albedo to provide a criterion for the ill-posed problem. In addition, LiDAR intensity is difficult to handle due to its sparsity and occlusion, hence, a LiDAR intensity densification module is proposed.

However, existing works typically train on large datasets of image-text pairs and have been designed to perform downstream tasks involving only small to medium sized-images, neither of which are applicable to the emerging field of computational pathology where there are limited publicly available paired image-text datasets and each image can span up to 100,000 x 100,000 pixels in dimensions.

MI-Zero reformulates zero-shot transfer under the framework of multiple instance learning to overcome the computational challenge of inference on extremely large images. We used over 550k pathology reports and other available in-domain text corpora to pretrain our text encoder.

It is thus crucial to develop high dynamic range (HDR) imaging techniques for mobile phones. Unfortunately, the existing HDR image datasets are mostly constructed by DSLR cameras in daytime, limiting their applicability to the study of HDR imaging for mobile phones. In this work, we develop, for the first time to our best knowledge, an HDR image dataset by using mobile phone cameras, namely Mobile-HDR dataset.

Since aerial images are globally available at low cost, they represent a potential compromise between two established paradigms of autonomous driving, i.e. using expensive high-definition prior maps or relying entirely on the sensor data captured at runtime. We present an end-to-end differentiable model that uses the ground and aerial images to predict a probability distribution over possible vehicle poses. We combine multiple vehicle datasets with aerial images from orthophoto providers on which we demonstrate the feasibility of our method. Since the ground truth poses are often inaccurate w.r.t. the aerial images, we implement a pseudo-label approach to produce more accurate ground truth poses and make them publicly available. While previous works require training data from the target region to achieve reasonable localization accuracy (i.e. same-area evaluation), our approach overcomes this limitation and outperforms previous results even in the strictly more challenging cross-area case. We improve the previous state-of-the-art by a large margin even without ground or aerial data from the test region, which highlights the model's potential for global-scale application.

While most of the deep noise generators proposed to synthesize sRGB real noise using an end-to-end trained model, the lack of explicit noise modeling degrades the quality of their synthesized noise. In this work, we propose to model the real noise as not only dependent on the underlying clean image pixel intensity, but also highly correlated to its neighboring noise realization within the local region. Correspondingly, we propose a novel noise synthesizing framework by explicitly learning its neighboring correlation on top of the signal dependency. With the proposed noise model, our framework greatly bridges the distribution gap between synthetic noise and real noise. We show that our generated ""real"" sRGB noisy images can be used for training supervised deep denoisers, thus to improve their real denoising results with a large margin, comparing to the popular classic denoisers or the deep denoisers that are trained on other sRGB noise generators.

To address the first problem, we propose a geometry-aware temporal aggregation module to handle the egomotion explicitly. The effect of egomotion is mitigated by estimating the temporal geometry transformation and exploiting it to update visual representations. Moreover, we propose a cascaded feature enhancement module to tackle the second issue. It improves cross-modal localization robustness by disentangling visually-indicated audio representation.

In this work, we show that the recently proposed Deep Equilibrium Model (DEQ) can be naturally adapted to this form of computation. Our Landmark DEQ (LDEQ) achieves state-of-the-art performance on the challenging WFLW facial landmark dataset, reaching 3.92 NME with fewer parameters and a training memory cost of O(1) in the number of recurrent modules. Furthermore, we show that DEQs are particularly suited for landmark detection in videos. In this setting, it is typical to train on still images due to the lack of labelled videos. This can lead to a ""flickering"" effect at inference time on video, whereby a model can rapidly oscillate between different plausible solutions across consecutive frames. By rephrasing DEQs as a constrained optimization, we emulate recurrence at inference time, despite not having access to temporal data at training time. This Recurrence without Recurrence (RwR) paradigm helps in reducing landmark flicker, which we demonstrate by introducing a new metric, normalized mean flicker (NMF), and contributing a new facial landmark video dataset (WFLW-V) targeting landmark uncertainty.

Our method does not require flash/non-flash images to be captured in pairs. Building on the success of neural light fields, we use an off-the-shelf method to capture the ambient reflections, while the flashlight component enables physically accurate photometric constraints to decouple reflectance and illumination.

Previous works usually overlook the asymmetric motions between two hands and generate two hands in a holistic manner, leading to unnatural results. In this work, we introduce a novel bilateral hand disentanglement based two-stage 3D hand generation method to achieve natural and diverse 3D hand prediction from body dynamics. In the first stage, we intend to generate natural hand gestures by two hand-disentanglement branches. Considering the asymmetric gestures and motions of two hands, we introduce a Spatial-Residual Memory (SRM) module to model spatial interaction between the body and each hand by residual learning. To enhance the coordination of two hand motions wrt. body dynamics holistically, we then present a Temporal-Motion Memory (TMM) module.

Once the subject is embedded in the output domain of the model, the unique identifier can be used to synthesize novel photorealistic images of the subject contextualized in different scenes. By leveraging the semantic prior embedded in the model with a new autogenous class-specific prior preservation loss, our technique enables synthesizing the subject in diverse scenes, poses, views and lighting conditions that do not appear in the reference images. We apply our technique to several previously-unassailable tasks, including subject recontextualization, text-guided view synthesis, and artistic rendering, all while preserving the subject's key features.

Recently, deep learning has achieved promising results in medical image analysis tasks. However, the unexplainability of black box models and the requirement of massive annotated samples limit the clinical application of deep learning based diagnostic methods. In this paper, aiming to develop an accurate, objective, and explainable diagnosis tool for MVI, we propose a Loopback Network (LoopNet) for classifying MVI efficiently. With the image-level category annotations of the collected Pathologic Vessel Image Dataset (PVID), LoopNet is devised to be composed binary classification branch and cell locating branch. The latter is devised to locate the area of cancerous cells, regular non-cancerous cells, and background. For healthy samples, the pseudo masks of cells supervise the cell locating branch to distinguish the area of regular non-cancerous cells and background. For each MVI sample, the cell locating branch predicts the mask of cancerous cells. Then the masked cancerous and non-cancerous areas of the same sample are inputted back to the binary classification branch separately. The loopback between two branches enables the category label to supervise the cell locating branch to learn the locating ability for cancerous areas. Experiment results show that the proposed LoopNet achieves 97.5% accuracy on MVI classification.

However, autonomous driving algorithms relying on the visible spectrum band are easily impacted by weather and lighting conditions. A long-wave infrared camera, also known as a thermal imaging camera, is a potential rescue to achieve high-level robustness. However, the missing necessities are the well-established large-scale dataset and public benchmark results. To this end, in this paper, we first built a large-scale Multi-Spectral Stereo (MS^2) dataset, including stereo RGB, stereo NIR, stereo thermal, and stereo LiDAR data along with GNSS/IMU information. The collected dataset provides about 195K synchronized data pairs taken from city, residential, road, campus, and suburban areas in the morning, daytime, and nighttime under clear-sky, cloudy, and rainy conditions. Secondly, we conduct an exhaustive validation process of monocular and stereo depth estimation algorithms designed on visible spectrum bands to benchmark their performance in the thermal image domain.

However, the blur involved in real applications are usually space-variant due to object motion, out-of-focus, etc., resulting in severe performance drop of the advanced SR methods. To address this problem, we firstly introduce two new datasets with out-of-focus blur, i.e., NYUv2-BSR and Cityscapes-BSR, to support further researches of blind SR with space-variant blur. Based on the datasets, we design a novel Cross-MOdal fuSion network (CMOS) that estimate both blur and semantics simultaneously, which leads to improved SR results. It involves a feature Grouping Interactive Attention (GIA) module to make the two modals interact more effectively and avoid inconsistency. GIA can also be used for the interaction of other features because of the universality of its structure.

Black, Silvia Zuffi","We address the problem of inferring the 3D shape and pose of dogs from images. Given the lack of 3D training data, this problem is challenging, and the best methods lag behind those designed to estimate human shape and pose. To make progress, we attack the problem from multiple sides at once. First, we need a good 3D shape prior, like those available for humans. To that end, we learn a dog-specific 3D parametric model, called D-SMAL. Second, existing methods focus on dogs in standing poses because when they sit or lie down, their legs are self occluded and their bodies deform. Without access to a good pose prior or 3D data, we need an alternative approach. To that end, we exploit contact with the ground as a form of side information. We consider an existing large dataset of dog images and label any 3D contact of the dog with the ground. We exploit body-ground contact in estimating dog pose and find that it significantly improves results. Third, we develop a novel neural network architecture to infer and exploit this contact information. Fourth, to make progress, we have to be able to measure it. Current evaluation metrics are based on 2D features like keypoints and silhouettes, which do not directly correlate with 3D errors. To address this, we create a synthetic dataset containing rendered images of scanned 3D dogs. With these advances, our method recovers significantly better dog shape and pose than the state of the art, and we evaluate this improvement in 3D.

Even though previous works recognize the utility of asynchronous event information for this task, they ignore the fact that motion may or may not result in blur in the input video to be interpolated, depending on the length of the exposure time of the frames and the speed of the motion, and assume either that the input video is sharp, restricting themselves to frame interpolation, or that it is blurry, including an explicit, separate deblurring stage before interpolation in their pipeline. We instead propose a general method for event-based frame interpolation that performs deblurring ad-hoc and thus works both on sharp and blurry input videos. Our model consists in a bidirectional recurrent network that naturally incorporates the temporal dimension of interpolation and fuses information from the input frames and the events adaptively based on their temporal proximity. In addition, we introduce a novel real-world high-resolution dataset with events and color videos which provides a challenging evaluation setting for the examined task.

Fake media, in both visual and textual forms, is widespread on the web. While various deepfake detection and text fake news detection methods have been proposed, they are only designed for single-modality forgery based on binary classification, let alone analyzing and reasoning subtle forgery traces across different modalities. In this paper, we highlight a new research problem for multi-modal fake media, namely Detecting and Grounding Multi-Modal Media Manipulation (DGM^4). DGM^4 aims to not only detect the authenticity of multi-modal media, but also ground the manipulated content (i.e., image bounding boxes and text tokens), which requires deeper reasoning of multi-modal media manipulation. To support a large-scale investigation, we construct the first DGM^4 dataset, where image-text pairs are manipulated by various approaches, with rich annotation of diverse manipulations. Moreover, we propose a novel HierArchical Multi-modal Manipulation rEasoning tRansformer (HAMMER) to fully capture the fine-grained interaction between different modalities. HAMMER performs 1) manipulation-aware contrastive learning between two uni-modal encoders as shallow manipulation reasoning, and 2) modality-aware cross-attention by multi-modal aggregator as deep manipulation reasoning. Dedicated manipulation detection and grounding heads are integrated from shallow to deep levels based on the interacted multi-modal information.

We test our approach on a range of datasets and achieve state-of-the-art results on both adverb prediction and antonym classification. Furthermore, we outperform previous work when we lift two commonly assumed conditions: the availability of action labels during testing and the pairing of adverbs as antonyms. Existing datasets for adverb recognition are either noisy, which makes learning difficult, or contain actions whose appearance is not influenced by adverbs, which makes evaluation less reliable. To address this, we collect a new high quality dataset: Adverbs in Recipes (AIR). We focus on instructional recipes videos, curating a set of actions that exhibit meaningful visual changes when performed differently.

Yet, despite the performance gains contributed by large vision and language pretraining, we find that--across 7 architectures trained with 4 algorithms on massive datasets--they struggle at compositionality. To arrive at this conclusion, we introduce a new compositionality evaluation benchmark, CREPE, which measures two important aspects of compositionality identified by cognitive science literature: systematicity and productivity. To measure systematicity, CREPE consists of a test dataset containing over 370K image-text pairs and three different seen-unseen splits. The three splits are designed to test models trained on three popular training datasets: CC-12M, YFCC-15M, and LAION-400M. We also generate 325K, 316K, and 309K hard negative captions for a subset of the pairs. To test productivity, CREPE contains 17K image-text pairs with nine different complexities plus 278K hard negative captions with atomic, swapping, and negation foils. The datasets are generated by repurposing the Visual Genome scene graphs and region descriptions and applying handcrafted templates and GPT-3. For systematicity, we find that model performance decreases consistently when novel compositions dominate the retrieval set, with Recall@1 dropping by up to 9%. For productivity, models' retrieval success decays as complexity increases, frequently nearing random chance at high complexity.

Although it warps moving points across frames from the observation spaces to a common canonical space for rendering, dynamic NeRF does not model the change of the reflected color during the warping. As a result, this approach often fails drastically on challenging specular objects in motion. We address this limitation by reformulating the neural radiance field function to be conditioned on surface position and orientation in the observation space. This allows the specular surface at different poses to keep the different reflected colors when mapped to the common canonical space. Additionally, we add the mask of moving objects to guide the deformation field. As the specular surface changes color during motion, the mask mitigates the problem of failure to find temporal correspondences with only RGB supervision. We evaluate our model based on the novel view synthesis quality with a self-collected dataset of different moving specular objects in realistic environments.

Then, we propose a Collaborative noisy Label Cleaner (CLC) framework to learn from noisy highlight moments. CLC consists of two modules: augmented cross-propagation (ACP) and multi-modality cleaning (MMC). The former aims to exploit the closely related audio-visual signals and fuse them to learn unified multi-modal representations. The latter aims to achieve cleaner highlight labels by observing the changes in losses among different modalities. To verify the effectiveness of CLC, we further collect a large-scale highlight dataset named MovieLights. Comprehensive experiments on MovieLights and YouTube Highlights datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

CVPR-2023-997,CVPR,2023,Deep Polarization Reconstruction With PDAVIS Events,"Haiyang Mei, Zuowen Wang, Xin Yang, Xiaopeng Wei, Tobi Delbruck","The polarization event camera PDAVIS is a novel bio-inspired neuromorphic vision sensor that reports both conventional polarization frames and asynchronous, continuously per-pixel polarization brightness changes (polarization events) with fast temporal resolution and large dynamic range. A deep neural network method (Polarization FireNet) was previously developed to reconstruct the polarization angle and degree from polarization events for bridging the gap between the polarization event camera and mainstream computer vision. However, Polarization FireNet applies a network pre-trained for normal event-based frame reconstruction independently on each of four channels of polarization events from four linear polarization angles, which ignores the correlations between channels and inevitably introduces content inconsistency between the four reconstructed frames, resulting in unsatisfactory polarization reconstruction performance. In this work, we strive to train an effective, yet efficient, DNN model that directly outputs polarization from the input raw polarization events. To this end, we constructed the first large-scale event-to-polarization dataset, which we subsequently employed to train our events-to-polarization network E2P. E2P extracts rich polarization patterns from input polarization events and enhances features through cross-modality context integration. We demonstrate that E2P outperforms Polarization FireNet by a significant margin with no additional computing cost. Experimental results also show that E2P produces more accurate measurement of polarization than the PDAVIS frames in challenging fast and high dynamic range scenes.",True,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/papers/Wu_Incremental_3D_Semantic_Scene_Graph_Prediction_From_RGB_Sequences_CVPR_2023_paper.pdf

In this work, we aim to facilitate the task of editing the geometry of 3D models through the use of natural language. For example, we may want to modify a 3D chair model to ""make its legs thinner"" or to ""open a hole in its back"". To tackle this problem in a manner that promotes open-ended language use and enables fine-grained shape edits, we introduce the most extensive existing corpus of natural language utterances describing shape differences: ShapeTalk. ShapeTalk contains over half a million discriminative utterances produced by contrasting the shapes of common 3D objects for a variety of object classes and degrees of similarity. We also introduce a generic framework, ChangeIt3D, which builds on ShapeTalk and can use an arbitrary 3D generative model of shapes to produce edits that align the output better with the edit or deformation description. Finally, we introduce metrics for the quantitative evaluation of language-assisted shape editing methods that reflect key desiderata within this editing setup. We note that ShapeTalk allows methods to be trained with explicit 3D-to-language data, bypassing the necessity of ""lifting"" 2D to 3D using methods like neural rendering, as required by extant 2D image-language foundation models.

Parts, as the shared components in different object categories, have the potential to increase the generalization ability of the manipulation policy and achieve cross-category object manipulation. In this work, we build the first large-scale, part-based cross-category object manipulation benchmark, PartManip, which is composed of 11 object categories, 494 objects, and 1432 tasks in 6 task classes. Compared to previous work, our benchmark is also more diverse and realistic, i.e., having more objects and using sparse-view point cloud as input without oracle information like part segmentation. To tackle the difficulties of vision-based policy learning, we first train a state-based expert with our proposed part-based canonicalization and part-aware rewards, and then distill the knowledge to a vision-based student. We also find an expressive backbone is essential to overcome the large diversity of different objects. For cross-category generalization, we introduce domain adversarial learning for domain-invariant feature extraction.

Given their power to express human behavior, hands have been a very important, but challenging component of the human body. Currently, most of the state-of-the-art reconstruction and pose estimation methods rely on the low polygon MANO model. Apart from its low polygon count, MANO model was trained with only 31 adult subjects, which not only limits its expressive power but also imposes unnecessary shape reconstruction constraints on pose estimation methods. Moreover, hand appearance remains almost unexplored and neglected from the majority of hand reconstruction methods. In this work, we propose ""Handy"", a large-scale model of the human hand, modeling both shape and appearance composed of over 1200 subjects which we make publicly available for the benefit of the research community. In contrast to current models, our proposed hand model was trained on a dataset with large diversity in age, gender, and ethnicity, which tackles the limitations of MANO and accurately reconstructs out-of-distribution samples. In order to create a high quality texture model, we trained a powerful GAN, which preserves high frequency details and is able to generate high resolution hand textures. To showcase the capabilities of the proposed model, we built a synthetic dataset of textured hands and trained a hand pose estimation network to reconstruct both the shape and appearance from single images. As it is demonstrated in an extensive series of quantitative as well as qualitative experiments, our model proves to be robust against the state-of-the-art and realistically captures the 3D hand shape and pose along with a high frequency detailed texture even in adverse ""in-the-wild"" conditions.",True,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/papers/Alper_Is_BERT_Blind_Exploring_the_Effect_of_Vision-and-Language_Pretraining_on_CVPR_2023_paper.pdf

To achieve this, we propose a scene analysis method to detect and initialize key points by considering the dynamics in the scene, and a weighted key points strategy to model topologically varying dynamics by joint key points and weights optimization.

In this work, we propose a novel contrastive learning approach that uses movie metadata to learn a general-purpose scene representation. Specifically, we use movie metadata to define a measure of movie similarity, and use it during contrastive learning to limit our search for positive scene-pairs to only the movies that are considered similar to each other. Our learned scene representation consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on a diverse set of tasks evaluated using multiple benchmark datasets. Notably, our learned representation offers an average improvement of 7.9% on the seven classification tasks and 9.7% improvement on the two regression tasks in LVU dataset.

Most previous approaches have opted to learn single representations of query images, which are then classified at different levels of geographic granularity. These approaches fail to exploit the different visual cues that give context to different hierarchies, such as the country, state, and city level. To this end, we introduce an end-to-end transformer-based architecture that exploits the relationship between different geographic levels (which we refer to as hierarchies) and the corresponding visual scene information in an image through hierarchical cross-attention. We achieve this by learning a query for each geographic hierarchy and scene type. Furthermore, we learn a separate representation for different environmental scenes, as different scenes in the same location are often defined by completely different visual features.

Existing methods mostly take a set of high-resolution (HR) images as GTs and apply various degradations to simulate their low-resolution (LR) counterparts. Though great progress has been achieved, such an LR-HR pair generation scheme has several limitations. First, the perceptual quality of HR images may not be high enough, limiting the quality of Real-ISR outputs. Second, existing schemes do not consider much human perception in GT generation, and the trained models tend to produce over-smoothed results or unpleasant artifacts. With the above considerations, we propose a human guided GT generation scheme. We first elaborately train multiple image enhancement models to improve the perceptual quality of HR images, and enable one LR image having multiple HR counterparts. Human subjects are then involved to annotate the high quality regions among the enhanced HR images as GTs, and label the regions with unpleasant artifacts as negative samples. A human guided GT image dataset with both positive and negative samples is then constructed, and a loss function is proposed to train the Real-ISR models.

This paper presents an approach for detecting educational content in online videos. We focus on two widely used educational content classes: literacy and math. For each class, we choose prominent codes (sub-classes) based on the Common Core Standards. For example, literacy codes include 'letter names', 'letter sounds', and math codes include 'counting', 'sorting'. We pose this as a fine-grained multilabel classification problem as videos can contain multiple types of educational content and the content classes can get visually similar (e.g., 'letter names' vs 'letter sounds').

We learn a class prototype for each class and a loss function is employed to minimize the distances between a class prototype and the samples from the class. Similarly, distances between a class prototype and the samples from other classes are maximized.

Marsden, Bin Yang","Since experiencing domain shifts during test-time is inevitable in practice, test-time adaption (TTA) continues to adapt the model after deployment. Recently, the area of continual and gradual test-time adaptation (TTA) emerged. In contrast to standard TTA, continual TTA considers not only a single domain shift, but a sequence of shifts. Gradual TTA further exploits the property that some shifts evolve gradually over time. Since in both settings long test sequences are present, error accumulation needs to be addressed for methods relying on self-training. In this work, we propose and show that in the setting of TTA, the symmetric cross-entropy is better suited as a consistency loss for mean teachers compared to the commonly used cross-entropy. This is justified by our analysis with respect to the (symmetric) cross-entropy's gradient properties. To pull the test feature space closer to the source domain, where the pre-trained model is well posed, contrastive learning is leveraged.

During training, we overcome the need for BEV ground truth annotations by leveraging the more easily available FV semantic annotations of video sequences. Thus, we propose the SkyEye architecture that learns based on two modes of self-supervision, namely, implicit supervision and explicit supervision. Implicit supervision trains the model by enforcing spatial consistency of the scene over time based on FV semantic sequences, while explicit supervision exploits BEV pseudolabels generated from FV semantic annotations and self-supervised depth estimates. Extensive evaluations on the KITTI-360 dataset demonstrate that our self-supervised approach performs on par with the state-of-the-art fully supervised methods and achieves competitive results using only 1% of direct supervision in BEV compared to fully supervised approaches. Finally, we publicly release both our code and the BEV datasets generated from the KITTI-360 and Waymo datasets.",True,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/papers/Liu_Learning_Orthogonal_Prototypes_for_Generalized_Few-Shot_Semantic_Segmentation_CVPR_2023_paper.pdf

Current approaches fail for a long sequence of tasks from diverse domains and difficulties. Many of the existing CL approaches are difficult to apply in practice due to excessive memory cost or training time, or are tightly coupled to a single device. With the intuition derived from the widely applied mini-batch training, we propose Batch Model Consolidation (BMC) to support more realistic CL under conditions where multiple agents are exposed to a range of tasks. During a regularization phase, BMC trains multiple expert models in parallel on a set of disjoint tasks. Each expert maintains weight similarity to a base model through a stability loss, and constructs a buffer from a fraction of the task's data. During the consolidation phase, we combine the learned knowledge on 'batches' of expert models using a batched consolidation loss in memory data that aggregates all buffers. We thoroughly evaluate each component of our method in an ablation study and demonstrate the effectiveness on standardized benchmark datasets Split-CIFAR-100, Tiny-ImageNet, and the Stream dataset composed of 71 image classification tasks from diverse domains and difficulties.

For example, DNNs have been less successful as a model of the egocentric to allocentric transformation embodied by circuits in retrosplenial and posterior parietal cortex.

It is challenging to perform this task with a single network due to resolution issues, i.e., the face and hands are usually located in extremely small regions. Existing works usually detect hands and faces, enlarge their resolution to feed in a specific network to predict the parameter, and finally fuse the results. While this copy-paste pipeline can capture the fine-grained details of the face and hands, the connections between different parts cannot be easily recovered in late fusion, leading to implausible 3D rotation and unnatural pose. In this work, we propose a one-stage pipeline for expressive whole-body mesh recovery, named OSX, without separate networks for each part. Specifically, we design a Component Aware Transformer (CAT) composed of a global body encoder and a local face/hand decoder. The encoder predicts the body parameters and provides a high-quality feature map for the decoder, which performs a feature-level upsample-crop scheme to extract high-resolution part-specific features and adopt keypoint-guided deformable attention to estimate hand and face precisely. The whole pipeline is simple yet effective without any manual post-processing and naturally avoids implausible prediction. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of OSX.

These methods can be summarized into implicit attention based and supervised attention based, depended on how the attention is computed, i.e., implicit attention and supervised attention are learned from sequence-level text annotations and character-level bounding box annotations, respectively. Implicit attention, as it may extract coarse or even incorrect spatial regions as character attention, is prone to suffering from an alignment-drifted issue. Supervised attention can alleviate the above issue, but it is category-specific, which requires extra laborious character-level bounding box annotations and would be memory-intensive when the number of character categories is large. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose a novel attention mechanism for STR, self-supervised implicit glyph attention (SIGA). SIGA delineates the glyph structures of text images by jointly self-supervised text segmentation and implicit attention alignment, which serve as the supervision to improve attention correctness without extra character-level annotations.

OmniObject3D has several appealing properties: 1) Large Vocabulary: It comprises 6,000 scanned objects in 190 daily categories, sharing common classes with popular 2D datasets (e.g., ImageNet and LVIS), benefiting the pursuit of generalizable 3D representations. 2) Rich Annotations: Each 3D object is captured with both 2D and 3D sensors, providing textured meshes, point clouds, multiview rendered images, and multiple real-captured videos. 3) Realistic Scans: The professional scanners support high-quality object scans with precise shapes and realistic appearances. With the vast exploration space offered by OmniObject3D, we carefully set up four evaluation tracks: a) robust 3D perception, b) novel-view synthesis, c) neural surface reconstruction, and d) 3D object generation.

Based on GAPartNet, we investigate three cross-category tasks: part segmentation, part pose estimation, and part-based object manipulation. Given the significant domain gaps between seen and unseen object categories, we propose a robust 3D segmentation method from the perspective of domain generalization by integrating adversarial learning techniques. Our method outperforms all existing methods by a large margin, no matter on seen or unseen categories.

This is because collecting 3D interacting hands data in the wild is extremely challenging, even for the 2D data. We present InterWild, which brings MoCap and ITW samples to shared domains for robust 3D interacting hands recovery in the wild with a limited amount of ITW 2D/3D interacting hands data. 3D interacting hands recovery consists of two sub-problems: 1) 3D recovery of each hand and 2) 3D relative translation recovery between two hands. For the first sub-problem, we bring MoCap and ITW samples to a shared 2D scale space. Although ITW datasets provide a limited amount of 2D/3D interacting hands, they contain large-scale 2D single hand data. Motivated by this, we use a single hand image as an input for the first sub-problem regardless of whether two hands are interacting. Hence, interacting hands of MoCap datasets are brought to the 2D scale space of single hands of ITW datasets. For the second sub-problem, we bring MoCap and ITW samples to a shared appearance-invariant space. Unlike the first sub-problem, 2D labels of ITW datasets are not helpful for the second sub-problem due to the 3D translation's ambiguity. Hence, instead of relying on ITW samples, we amplify the generalizability of MoCap samples by taking only a geometric feature without an image as an input for the second sub-problem. As the geometric feature is invariant to appearances, MoCap and ITW samples do not suffer from a huge appearance gap between the two datasets.

The semantically associated landmarks are a series of landmark pairs with the same local semantics on the in-shop garment image and the try-on image. Based on the semantically associated landmarks, SAL-VTON effectively models the local semantic association between garment and person, making up for the misalignment in the overall deformation of the garment. The outcome is achieved with a three-stage framework: 1) the semantically associated landmarks are estimated using the landmark localization model; 2) taking the landmarks as input, the warping model explicitly associates the corresponding parts of the garment and person for obtaining the local flow, thus refining the alignment in the global flow; 3) finally, a generator consumes the landmarks to better capture local semantics and control the try-on results.Moreover, we propose a new landmark dataset with a unified labelling rule of landmarks for diverse styles of garments.

Recent learning-based approaches have achieved unprecedented accuracy and efficiency in the area of 3D real human digitization. However, none of the prior works focus on modeling 3D biped cartoon characters, which are also in great demand in gaming and filming. In this paper, we introduce 3DBiCar, the first large-scale dataset of 3D biped cartoon characters, and RaBit, the corresponding parametric model. Our dataset contains 1,500 topologically consistent high-quality 3D textured models which are manually crafted by professional artists. Built upon the data, RaBit is thus designed with a SMPL-like linear blend shape model and a StyleGAN-based neural UV-texture generator, simultaneously expressing the shape, pose, and texture. To demonstrate the practicality of 3DBiCar and RaBit, various applications are conducted, including single-view reconstruction, sketch-based modeling, and 3D cartoon animation. For the single-view reconstruction setting, we find a straightforward global mapping from input images to the output UV-based texture maps tends to lose detailed appearances of some local parts (e.g., nose, ears). Thus, a part-sensitive texture reasoner is adopted to make all important local areas perceived.

It aims to provide detailed textual descriptions for the given audible videos, including the appearance and spatial locations of each object, the actions of moving objects, and the sounds in videos. Existing visual-language modeling tasks often concentrate on visual cues in videos while undervaluing the language and audio modalities. On the other hand, FAVD requires not only audio-visual-language modeling skills but also paragraph-level language generation abilities. We construct the first fine-grained audible video description benchmark (FAVDBench) to facilitate this research. For each video clip, we first provide a one-sentence summary of the video, ie, the caption, followed by 4-6 sentences describing the visual details and 1-2 audio-related descriptions at the end. The descriptions are provided in both English and Chinese. We create two new metrics for this task: an EntityScore to gauge the completeness of entities in the visual descriptions, and an AudioScore to assess the audio descriptions. As a preliminary approach to this task, we propose an audio-visual-language transformer that extends existing video captioning model with an additional audio branch. We combine the masked language modeling and auto-regressive language modeling losses to optimize our model so that it can produce paragraph-level descriptions. We illustrate the efficiency of our model in audio-visual-language modeling by evaluating it against the proposed benchmark using both conventional captioning metrics and our proposed metrics.

We tackle this tradeoff using event cameras. Event cameras operate at microseconds resolution with negligible motion blur, and output a continuous stream of events that precisely measures how light changes over time asynchronously. We propose a setup that consists of a linear polarizer rotating at high speeds in front of an event camera. Our method uses the continuous event stream caused by the rotation to reconstruct relative intensities at multiple polarizer angles. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms physics-based baselines using frames, reducing the MAE by 25% in synthetic and real-world datasets. In the real world, we observe, however, that the challenging conditions (i.e., when few events are generated) harm the performance of physics-based solutions. To overcome this, we propose a learning-based approach that learns to estimate surface normals even at low event-rates, improving the physics-based approach by 52% on the real world dataset. The proposed system achieves an acquisition speed equivalent to 50 fps (>twice the framerate of the commercial polarization sensor) while retaining the spatial resolution of 1MP.

To this end, we propose a blur interpolation transformer (BiT) to effectively unravel the underlying temporal correlation encoded in blur. Based on multi-scale residual Swin transformer blocks, we introduce dual-end temporal supervision and temporally symmetric ensembling strategies to generate effective features for time-varying motion rendering.

To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel bottom-up approach to lane graph estimation from aerial imagery that aggregates multiple overlapping graphs into a single consistent graph.

By exploiting the learned parameters (u and sigma) of batch normalization layers in an FP32-pre-trained model, zero-shot quantization schemes focus on generating synthetic data. Subsequently, they distill knowledge from the pre-trained model (teacher) to the quantized model (student) such that the quantized model can be optimized with the synthetic dataset. However, thus far, zero-shot quantization has primarily been discussed in the context of quantization-aware training methods, which require task-specific losses and long-term optimization as much as retraining. We thus introduce a post-training quantization scheme for zero-shot quantization that produces high-quality quantized networks within a few hours. Furthermore, we propose a framework called GENIE that generates data suited for quantization. With the data synthesized by GENIE, we can produce robust quantized models without real datasets, which is comparable to few-shot quantization. We also propose a post-training quantization algorithm to enhance the performance of quantized models.

Four factors are considered: visual complexity, question redundancy, concept distribution and concept compositionality.

As an NP-hard problem, its challenge is further pronounced in the existence of outlier nodes in both graphs which is ubiquitous in practice, especially for vision problems. However, popular affinity-maximization-based paradigms often lack a principled scheme to suppress the false matching and resort to handcrafted thresholding to dismiss the outliers. This limitation is also inherited by the neural GM solvers though they have shown superior performance in the ideal no-outlier setting. In this paper, we propose to formulate the partial GM problem as the top-k selection task with a given/estimated number of inliers k. Specifically, we devise a differentiable top-k module that enables effective gradient descent over the optimal-transport layer, which can be readily plugged into SOTA deep GM pipelines including the quadratic matching network NGMv2 as well as the linear matching network GCAN. Meanwhile, the attention-fused aggregation layers are developed to estimate k to enable automatic outlier-robust matching in the wild.

The distinct data modality offered by high- resolution RGB images and low-resolution depth maps captured on a mobile device, when combined with precise 3D geometry annotations, presents a unique opportunity for future research on high-fidelity 3D reconstruction.

FMCW MIMO radar is widely used in autonomous driving alongside Lidar and RGB cameras. However, compared to Lidar, MIMO radar is usually of low resolution due to hardware size restrictions. For example, achieving 1-degree azimuth resolution requires at least 100 receivers, but a single MIMO device usually supports at most 12 receivers. Having limitations on the number of receivers is problematic since a high-resolution measurement of azimuth angle is essential for estimating the location and velocity of objects. To improve the azimuth resolution of MIMO radar, we propose a light, yet efficient, Analog-to-Digital super-resolution model (ADC-SR) that predicts or hallucinates additional radar signals using signals from only a few receivers. Compared with the baseline models that are applied to processed radar Range-Azimuth-Doppler (RAD) maps, we show that our ADC-SR method that processes raw ADC signals achieves comparable performance with 98% (50 times) fewer parameters. We also propose a hybrid super-resolution model (Hybrid-SR) combining our ADC-SR with a standard RAD super-resolution model, and show that performance can be improved by a large margin. Experiments on our City-Radar dataset and the RADIal dataset validate the importance of leveraging raw radar ADC signals. To assess the value of our super-resolution model for autonomous driving, we also perform object detection on the results of our super-resolution model and find that our super-resolution model improves detection performance by around 4% in mAP.",True,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/papers/Cao_Observation-Centric_SORT_Rethinking_SORT_for_Robust_Multi-Object_Tracking_CVPR_2023_paper.pdf

The ASAP Benchmark,"Xiaofeng Wang, Zheng Zhu, Yunpeng Zhang, Guan Huang, Yun Ye, Wenbo Xu, Ziwei Chen, Xingang Wang","In recent years, vision-centric perception has flourished in various autonomous driving tasks, including 3D detection, semantic map construction, motion forecasting, and depth estimation. Nevertheless, the latency of vision-centric approaches is too high for practical deployment (e.g., most camera-based 3D detectors have a runtime greater than 300ms). To bridge the gap between ideal researches and real-world applications, it is necessary to quantify the trade-off between performance and efficiency. Traditionally, autonomous-driving perception benchmarks perform the online evaluation, neglecting the inference time delay. To mitigate the problem, we propose the Autonomous-driving StreAming Perception (ASAP) benchmark, which is the first benchmark to evaluate the online performance of vision-centric perception in autonomous driving. On the basis of the 2Hz annotated nuScenes dataset, we first propose an annotation-extending pipeline to generate high-frame-rate labels for the 12Hz raw images. Referring to the practical deployment, the Streaming Perception Under constRained-computation (SPUR) evaluation protocol is further constructed, where the 12Hz inputs are utilized for streaming evaluation under the constraints of different computational resources. In the ASAP benchmark, comprehensive experiment results reveal that the model rank alters under different constraints, suggesting that the model latency and computation budget should be considered as design choices to optimize the practical deployment. To facilitate further research, we establish baselines for camera-based streaming 3D detection, which consistently enhance the streaming performance across various hardware.

However, multi-person scenario within untrimmed videos is also important for practical applications, which has not been well concerned yet. To address this, we shed light on this research field for the first time with essential contributions on dataset, theory, and practices. In particular, a large-scale dataset termed MPEblink that involves 686 untrimmed videos with 8748 eyeblink events is proposed under multi-person conditions. The samples are captured from unconstrained films to reveal ""in the wild"" characteristics. Meanwhile, a real-time multi-person eyeblink detection method is also proposed. Being different from the existing counterparts, our proposition runs in a one-stage spatio-temporal way with an end-to-end learning capacity. Specifically, it simultaneously addresses the sub-tasks of face detection, face tracking, and human instance-level eyeblink detection. This paradigm holds 2 main advantages: (1) eyeblink features can be facilitated via the face's global context (e.g., head pose and illumination condition) with joint optimization and interaction, and (2) addressing these sub-tasks in parallel instead of sequential manner can save time remarkably to meet the real-time running requirement.

Existing methods still struggle in challenging poses where the human body is highly occluded or is closely interacting with the scene. To address this issue, we propose a scene-aware egocentric pose estimation method that guides the prediction of the egocentric pose with scene constraints. To this end, we propose an egocentric depth estimation network to predict the scene depth map from a wide-view egocentric fisheye camera while mitigating the occlusion of the human body with a depth-inpainting network. Next, we propose a scene-aware pose estimation network that projects the 2D image features and estimated depth map of the scene into a voxel space and regresses the 3D pose with a V2V network. The voxel-based feature representation provides the direct geometric connection between 2D image features and scene geometry, and further facilitates the V2V network to constrain the predicted pose based on the estimated scene geometry.

The gold standard Motion capture (MoCap) systems are accurate but inaccessible to the general public due to their cost, hardware, and space constraints. In contrast, monocular human mesh recovery (HMR) methods are much more accessible than MoCap as they take single-view videos as inputs. Replacing the multi-view MoCap systems with a monocular HMR method would break the current barriers to collecting accurate 3D motion thus making exciting applications like motion analysis and motion-driven animation accessible to the general public. However, the performance of existing HMR methods degrades when the video contains challenging and dynamic motion that is not in existing MoCap datasets used for training. This reduces its appeal as dynamic motion is frequently the target in 3D motion recovery in the aforementioned applications. Our study aims to bridge the gap between monocular HMR and multi-view MoCap systems by leveraging information shared across multiple video instances of the same action. We introduce the Neural Motion (NeMo) field. It is optimized to represent the underlying 3D motions across a set of videos of the same action. Empirically, we show that NeMo can recover 3D motion in sports using videos from the Penn Action dataset, where NeMo outperforms existing HMR methods in terms of 2D keypoint detection.

Existing arts can be mainly divided into two threads: 1) RGB-dependent methods restore information using degraded RGB inputs only (e.g., low-light enhancement), 2) RGB-independent methods translate images captured under auxiliary near-infrared (NIR) illuminants into RGB domain (e.g., NIR2RGB translation). The latter is very attractive since it works in complete darkness and the illuminants are visually friendly to naked eyes, but tends to be unstable due to its intrinsic ambiguities. In this paper, we try to robustify NIR2RGB translation by designing the optimal spectrum of auxiliary illumination in the wide-band VIS-NIR range, while keeping visual friendliness. Our core idea is to quantify the visibility constraint implied by the human vision system and incorporate it into the design pipeline. By modeling the formation process of images in the VIS-NIR range, the optimal multiplexing of a wide range of LEDs is automatically designed in a fully differentiable manner, within the feasible region defined by the visibility constraint.

However, this approach is currently limited: effects of the optical hardware stack and in particular lenses are hard to model in a unified way. This limits the quality that can be achieved for camera calibration and the fidelity of the results of 3D reconstruction. In this paper, we propose NeuroLens, a neural lens model for distortion and vignetting that can be used for point projection and ray casting and can be optimized through both operations. This means that it can (optionally) be used to perform pre-capture calibration using classical calibration targets, and can later be used to perform calibration or refinement during 3D reconstruction, e.g., while optimizing a radiance field. To evaluate the performance of our proposed model, we create a comprehensive dataset assembled from the Lensfun database with a multitude of lenses. Using this and other real-world datasets, we show that the quality of our proposed lens model outperforms standard packages as well as recent approaches while being much easier to use and extend. The model generalizes across many lens types and is trivial to integrate into existing 3D reconstruction and rendering systems.

To address this gap, we present MaxRay: a synthetic radio-visual dataset and benchmark that facilitate precise target localisation in radio. We further propose to learn to localise targets in radio without supervision by extracting self-coordinates from radio-visual correspondence. We use such self-supervised coordinates to train a radio localiser network. We characterise our performance against a number of state-of-the-art baselines. Our results indicate that accurate radio target localisation can be automatically learned from paired radio-visual data without labels, which is important for empirical data.

For instance, models trained on ImageNet are biased towards object categories, while a user might prefer the model to focus on colors, textures or specific elements in the scene. In this paper, we propose the GeneCIS ('genesis') benchmark, which measures models' ability to adapt to a range of similarity conditions. Extending prior work, our benchmark is designed for zero-shot evaluation only, and hence considers an open-set of similarity conditions. We find that baselines from powerful CLIP models struggle on GeneCIS and that performance on the benchmark is only weakly correlated with ImageNet accuracy, suggesting that simply scaling existing methods is not fruitful. We further propose a simple, scalable solution based on automatically mining information from existing image-caption datasets.

Prevailing affordance learning algorithms often adopt the label assignment paradigm and presume that there is a unique relationship between functional region and affordance label, yielding poor performance when adapting to unseen environments with large appearance variations. In this paper, we propose to leverage interactive affinity for affordance learning, i.e., extracting interactive affinity from human-object interaction and transferring it to non-interactive objects. Interactive affinity, which represents the contacts between different parts of the human body and local regions of the target object, can provide inherent cues of interconnectivity between humans and objects, thereby reducing the ambiguity of the perceived action possibilities. Specifically, we propose a pose-aided interactive affinity learning framework that exploits human pose to guide the network to learn the interactive affinity from human-object interactions. Particularly, a keypoint heuristic perception (KHP) scheme is devised to exploit the keypoint association of human pose to alleviate the uncertainties due to interaction diversities and contact occlusions. Besides, a contact-driven affordance learning (CAL) dataset is constructed by collecting and labeling over 5,000 images.

Generally, these methods usually assume that the corrupted region masks of each frame are known and easily obtained. However, the annotation of these masks are labor-intensive and expensive, which limits the practical application of current methods. Therefore, we expect to relax this assumption by defining a new semi-supervised inpainting setting, making the networks have the ability of completing the corrupted regions of the whole video using the annotated mask of only one frame. Specifically, in this work, we propose an end-to-end trainable framework consisting of completion network and mask prediction network, which are designed to generate corrupted contents of the current frame using the known mask and decide the regions to be filled of the next frame, respectively. Besides, we introduce a cycle consistency loss to regularize the training parameters of these two networks. In this way, the completion network and the mask prediction network can constrain each other, and hence the overall performance of the trained model can be maximized. Furthermore, due to the natural existence of prior knowledge (e.g., corrupted contents and clear borders), current video inpainting datasets are not suitable in the context of semi-supervised video inpainting. Thus, we create a new dataset by simulating the corrupted video of real-world scenarios.

Humans constantly explore and learn about their environment out of curiosity, gather information, and update their models of the world. On the other hand, machines are either trained to learn passively from static and fixed datasets, or taught to complete specific goal-conditioned tasks. To encourage the development of exploratory interactive agents, we present the EXCALIBUR benchmark. EXCALIBUR allows agents to explore their environment for long durations and then query their understanding of the physical world via inquiries like: ""is the small heavy red bowl made from glass?"" or ""is there a silver spoon heavier than the egg?"". This design encourages agents to perform free-form home exploration without myopia induced by goal conditioning. Once the agents have answered a series of questions, they can renter the scene to refine their knowledge, update their beliefs, and improve their performance on the questions. Our experiments demonstrate the challenges posed by this dataset for the present-day state-of-the-art embodied systems and the headroom afforded to develop new innovative methods. Finally, we present a virtual reality interface that enables humans to seamlessly interact within the simulated world and use it to gather human performance measures.

A physics engine can be used to enforce physical plausibility, but these are not differentiable, rely on unrealistic proxy bodies, and are difficult to integrate into existing optimization and learning frameworks. In contrast, we exploit novel intuitive-physics (IP) terms that can be inferred from a 3D SMPL body interacting with the scene. Inspired by biomechanics, we infer the pressure heatmap on the body, the Center of Pressure (CoP) from the heatmap, and the SMPL body's Center of Mass (CoM). With these, we develop IPMAN, to estimate a 3D body from a color image in a ""stable"" configuration by encouraging plausible floor contact and overlapping CoP and CoM. Our IP terms are intuitive, easy to implement, fast to compute, differentiable, and can be integrated into existing optimization and regression methods. We evaluate IPMAN on standard datasets and MoYo, a new dataset with synchronized multi-view images, ground-truth 3D bodies with complex poses, body-floor contact, CoM and pressure.

Existing classic RES datasets and methods commonly support single-target expressions only, i.e., one expression refers to one target object. Multi-target and no-target expressions are not considered. This limits the usage of RES in practice. In this paper, we introduce a new benchmark called Generalized Referring Expression Segmentation (GRES), which extends the classic RES to allow expressions to refer to an arbitrary number of target objects. Towards this, we construct the first large-scale GRES dataset called gRefCOCO that contains multi-target, no-target, and single-target expressions. GRES and gRefCOCO are designed to be well-compatible with RES, facilitating extensive experiments to study the performance gap of the existing RES methods on the GRES task.

This is an unrealistic assumption for any real-world setting, which motivates us to propose: a practical real-time evaluation of continual learning, in which the stream does not wait for the model to complete training before revealing the next data for predictions. To do this, we evaluate current CL methods with respect to their computational costs. We conduct extensive experiments on CLOC, a large-scale dataset containing 39 million time-stamped images with geolocation labels.

Classical few-shot benchmarks make use of few-shot samples from a single modality, but such samples may not be sufficient to characterize an entire concept class. In contrast, humans use cross-modal information to learn new concepts efficiently. In this work, we demonstrate that one can indeed build a better visual dog classifier by reading about dogs and listening to them bark. To do so, we exploit the fact that recent multimodal foundation models such as CLIP are inherently cross-modal, mapping different modalities to the same representation space. Specifically, we propose a simple cross-modal adaptation approach that learns from few-shot examples spanning different modalities. By repurposing class names as additional one-shot training samples, we achieve SOTA results with an embarrassingly simple linear classifier for vision-language adaptation. Furthermore, we show that our approach can benefit existing methods such as prefix tuning and classifier ensembling. Finally, to explore other modalities beyond vision and language, we construct the first (to our knowledge) audiovisual few-shot benchmark and use cross-modal training to improve the performance of both image and audio classification.

The core challenges are twofold. First, different types of temporal changes, such as illumination and changes to the underlying scene itself (such as replacing one graffiti artwork with another) are entangled together in the imagery. Second, scene-level temporal changes are often discrete and sporadic over time, rather than continuous. To tackle these problems, we propose a new scene representation equipped with a novel temporal step function encoding method that can model discrete scene-level content changes as piece-wise constant functions over time. Specifically, we represent the scene as a space-time radiance field with a per-image illumination embedding, where temporally-varying scene changes are encoded using a set of learned step functions. To facilitate our task of chronology reconstruction from Internet imagery, we also collect a new dataset of four scenes that exhibit various changes over time. We demonstrate that our method exhibits state-of-the-art view synthesis results on this dataset, while achieving independent control of viewpoint, time, and illumination.

Current methods mainly focus on the temporal smoothness of the predicted grasp poses but few consider their semantic consistency. Consequently, the predicted grasps are not guaranteed to fall on the same part of the same object, especially in cluttered scenes. In this paper, we propose to solve reactive grasping in a target-referenced setting by tracking through generated grasp spaces. Given a targeted grasp pose on an object and detected grasp poses in a new observation, our method is composed of two stages: 1) discovering grasp pose correspondences through an attentional graph neural network and selecting the one with the highest similarity with respect to the target pose; 2) refining the selected grasp poses based on target and historical information. We evaluate our method on a large-scale benchmark GraspNet-1Billion. We also collect 30 scenes of dynamic objects for testing. The results suggest that our method outperforms other representative methods.

This potentially unauthorized usage of online data leads to concerns regarding data privacy. Recent works aim to make unlearnable data for deep learning models by adding small, specially designed noises to tackle this issue. However, these methods are vulnerable to adversarial training (AT) and/or are computationally heavy. In this work, we propose a novel, model-free, Convolution-based Unlearnable DAtaset (CUDA) generation technique. CUDA is generated using controlled class-wise convolutions with filters that are randomly generated via a private key. CUDA encourages the network to learn the relation between filters and labels rather than informative features for classifying the clean data. We develop some theoretical analysis demonstrating that CUDA can successfully poison Gaussian mixture data by reducing the clean data performance of the optimal Bayes classifier. We also empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of CUDA with various datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet-100, and Tiny-ImageNet), and architectures (ResNet-18, VGG-16, Wide ResNet-34-10, DenseNet-121, DeIT, EfficientNetV2-S, and MobileNetV2). Our experiments show that CUDA is robust to various data augmentations and training approaches such as smoothing, AT with different budgets, transfer learning, and fine-tuning. For instance, training a ResNet-18 on ImageNet-100 CUDA achieves only 8.96%, 40.08%, and 20.58% clean test accuracies with empirical risk minimization (ERM), L_infinity AT, and L_2 AT, respectively.

Unfortunately, the image sensors of visible cameras are sensitive to light conditions like darkness or overexposure. To make up for this, recently, infrared sensors capable of stable imaging have received increasing attention in autonomous driving and monitoring. However, most prosperous vision models are still trained on massive clear visible data, facing huge visual gaps when deploying to infrared imaging scenarios. In such cases, transferring the infrared video to a distinct visible one with fine-grained semantic patterns is a worthwhile endeavor. Previous works improve the outputs by equally optimizing each patch on the translated visible results, which is unfair for enhancing the details on content-rich patches due to the long-tail effect of pixel distribution. Here we propose a novel CPTrans framework to tackle the challenge via balancing gradients of different patches, achieving the fine-grained Content-rich Patches Transferring. Specifically, the content-aware optimization module encourages model optimization along gradients of target patches, ensuring the improvement of visual details. Additionally, the content-aware temporal normalization module enforces the generator to be robust to the motions of target patches.

The existing literature has mainly addressed RGB-based problems, but RGB-infrared (RGB-IR) cross-modality matching problem has not been studied yet. In this paper, we propose a metric learning method Closest Permutation Matching (CPM) for RGB-IR G-ReID. We model each group as a set of single-person features which are extracted by MPANet, then we propose the metric Closest Permutation Distance (CPD) to measure the similarity between two sets of features. CPD is invariant with order changes of group members so that it solves the layout change problem in G-ReID. Furthermore, we introduce the problem of G-ReID without person labels.

In this paper, we introduce a novel image-free segmentation task where the goal is to perform semantic segmentation given only a set of the target semantic categories, but without any task-specific images and annotations. To tackle this challenging task, our proposed method, coined IFSeg, generates VL-driven artificial image-segmentation pairs and updates a pre-trained VL model to a segmentation task. We construct this artificial training data by creating a 2D map of random semantic categories and another map of their corresponding word tokens.

Due to the great difficulty of collecting paired real image and 3D hair data, using synthetic data to provide prior knowledge for real domain becomes a leading solution. This unfortunately introduces the challenge of domain gap. Due to the inherent difficulty of realistic hair rendering, existing methods typically use orientation maps instead of hair images as input to bridge the gap. We firmly think an intermediate representation is essential, but we argue that orientation map using the dominant filtering-based methods is sensitive to uncertain noise and far from a competent representation. Thus, we first raise this issue up and propose a novel intermediate representation, termed as HairStep, which consists of a strand map and a depth map. It is found that HairStep not only provides sufficient information for accurate 3D hair modeling, but also is feasible to be inferred from real images. Specifically, we collect a dataset of 1,250 portrait images with two types of annotations. A learning framework is further designed to transfer real images to the strand map and depth map. It is noted that, an extra bonus of our new dataset is the first quantitative metric for 3D hair modeling.

CVPR-2023-2125,CVPR,2023,Revisiting the Stack-Based Inverse Tone Mapping,"Ning Zhang, Yuyao Ye, Yang Zhao, Ronggang Wang","Current stack-based inverse tone mapping (ITM) methods can recover high dynamic range (HDR) radiance by predicting a set of multi-exposure images from a single low dynamic range image. However, there are still some limitations. On the one hand, these methods estimate a fixed number of images (e.g., three exposure-up and three exposure-down), which may introduce unnecessary computational cost or reconstruct incorrect results. On the other hand, they neglect the connections between the up-exposure and down-exposure models and thus fail to fully excavate effective features. In this paper, we revisit the stack-based ITM approaches and propose a novel method to reconstruct HDR radiance from a single image, which only needs to estimate two exposure images. At first, we design the exposure adaptive block that can adaptively adjust the exposure based on the luminance distribution of the input image. Secondly, we devise the cross-model attention block to connect the exposure adjustment models. Thirdly, we propose an end-to-end ITM pipeline by incorporating the multi-exposure fusion model. Furthermore, we propose and open a multi-exposure dataset that indicates the optimal exposure-up/down levels.

Derpanis, Jonathan Kelly, Marcus A. Brubaker, Igor Gilitschenski, Alex Levinshtein","Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have emerged as a popular approach for novel view synthesis. While NeRFs are quickly being adapted for a wider set of applications, intuitively editing NeRF scenes is still an open challenge. One important editing task is the removal of unwanted objects from a 3D scene, such that the replaced region is visually plausible and consistent with its context. We refer to this task as 3D inpainting. In 3D, solutions must be both consistent across multiple views and geometrically valid. In this paper, we propose a novel 3D inpainting method that addresses these challenges. Given a small set of posed images and sparse annotations in a single input image, our framework first rapidly obtains a 3D segmentation mask for a target object. Using the mask, a perceptual optimization-based approach is then introduced that leverages learned 2D image inpainters, distilling their information into 3D space, while ensuring view consistency. We also address the lack of a diverse benchmark for evaluating 3D scene inpainting methods by introducing a dataset comprised of challenging real-world scenes. In particular, our dataset contains views of the same scene with and without a target object, enabling more principled benchmarking of the 3D inpainting task. We first demonstrate the superiority of our approach on multiview segmentation, comparing to NeRF-based methods and 2D segmentation approaches. We then evaluate on the task of 3D inpainting, establishing state-of-the-art performance against other NeRF manipulation algorithms, as well as a strong 2D image inpainter baseline.",True,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/papers/Zhang_Towards_Efficient_Use_of_Multi-Scale_Features_in_Transformer-Based_Object_Detectors_CVPR_2023_paper.pdf

In practical applications, e.g., poster designs, the canvas is originally non-empty, and both inter-element relationships as well as inter-layer relationships should be concerned when generating a proper layout. A few recent works deal with them simultaneously, but they still suffer from poor graphic performance, such as a lack of layout variety or spatial non-alignment.

The accuracy of existing SfP methods is affected by two main problems. First, the ambiguity of polarization cues partially results in false normal estimation. Second, the widely-used assumption about orthographic projection is too ideal. To solve these problems, we propose the first approach that combines deep learning and stereo polarization information to recover not only normal but also disparity. Specifically, for the ambiguity problem, we design a Shape Consistency-based Mask Prediction (SCMP) module. It exploits the inherent consistency between normal and disparity to identify the areas with false normal estimation. We replace the unreliable features enclosed by these areas with new features extracted by global attention mechanism. As to the orthographic projection problem, we propose a novel Viewing Direction-aided Positional Encoding (VDPE) strategy. This strategy is based on the unique pixel-viewing direction encoding, and thus enables our neural network to handle the non-orthographic projection. In addition, we establish a real-world stereo SfP dataset that contains various object categories and illumination conditions.

Specifically, we introduce a novel Multi-Space Graph Neural Network (MS-GNN) that can extract spatial features from incomplete observations and leverage missing patterns. Additionally, we employ a Conditional VRNN with a specifically designed Temporal Decay (TD) module to capture temporal dependencies and temporal missing patterns in incomplete trajectories. The inclusion of the TD module allows for valuable information to be conveyed through the temporal flow.

The method firstly removes blur using a novel flow-based deblurring module and then compensates RS using a double encoder hourglass network. In contrast to previous methods, it does not rely on a constant velocity assumption and uses a simple architecture thanks to an event transformation dedicated to RS, called Filter and Flip (FnF), that transforms input events to encode only the changes between GS and RS images. To evaluate the proposed method and facilitate future research, we collect the first dataset with real events and high-quality RS images with optional blur, called RS-ERGB.

However, detecting mirrors over dynamic scenes is still under-explored due to the lack of a high-quality dataset and an effective method for video mirror detection (VMD). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to address the VMD problem from a deep-learning-based perspective. Our observation is that there are often correspondences between the contents inside (reflected) and outside (real) of a mirror, but such correspondences may not always appear in every frame, e.g., due to the change of camera pose. This inspires us to propose a video mirror detection method, named VMD-Net, that can tolerate spatially missing correspondences by considering the mirror correspondences at both the intra-frame level as well as inter-frame level via a dual correspondence module that looks over multiple frames spatially and temporally for correlating correspondences. We further propose a first large-scale dataset for VMD (named VMD-D), which contains 14,987 image frames from 269 videos with corresponding manually annotated masks. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms SOTA methods from relevant fields.

We introduce WeatherStream, an automatic pipeline capturing all real-world weather effects (rain, snow, and rain fog degradations), along with their clean image pairs. Previous state-of-the-art methods that have attempted the all-weather removal task train on synthetic pairs, and are thus limited by the Sim2Real domain gap. Recent work has attempted to manually collect time multiplexed pairs, but the use of human labor limits the scale of such a dataset. We introduce a pipeline that uses the power of light-transport physics and a model trained on a small, initial seed dataset to reject approximately 99.6% of unwanted scenes. The pipeline is able to generalize to new scenes and degradations that can, in turn, be used to train existing models just like fully human-labeled data. Training on a dataset collected through this procedure leads to significant improvements on multiple existing weather removal methods on a carefully human-collected test set of real-world weather effects.

However, most existing methods and datasets focus on single-person short-sequence scenes, hindering the application of AQA in more complex situations. To address this issue, we construct a new multi-person long-form video dataset for action quality assessment named LOGO. Distinguished in scenario complexity, our dataset contains 200 videos from 26 artistic swimming events with 8 athletes in each sample along with an average duration of 204.2 seconds. As for richness in annotations, LOGO includes formation labels to depict group information of multiple athletes and detailed annotations on action procedures. Furthermore, we propose a simple yet effective method to model relations among athletes and reason about the potential temporal logic in long-form videos. Specifically, we design a group-aware attention module, which can be easily plugged into existing AQA methods, to enrich the clip-wise representations based on contextual group information. To benchmark LOGO, we systematically conduct investigations on the performance of several popular methods in AQA and action segmentation. The results reveal the challenges our dataset brings. Extensive experiments also show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art on the LOGO dataset.

Manual counting is tedious and often leads to inter-observer variations among pathologists. While there exist multiple, general-purpose, deep learning-based object detection and counting methods, they may not readily transfer to detecting and counting cells in medical images, due to the limited data, presence of tiny overlapping objects, multiple cell types, severe class-imbalance, minute differences in size/shape of cells, etc. In response, we propose guided posterior regularization DeGPR, which assists an object detector by guiding it to exploit discriminative features among cells. The features may be pathologist-provided or inferred directly from visual data. We validate our model on two publicly available datasets (CoNSeP and MoNuSAC), and on MuCeD, a novel dataset that we contribute. MuCeD consists of 55 biopsy images of the human duodenum for predicting celiac disease.

Our multi-space scheme works as an enhancement to existing NeRF methods, with only small computational overheads needed for training and inferring the extra-space outputs.

Manufacturers thus use perceptual quality criteria throughout the development of smartphone cameras. This costly procedure can be partially replaced by automated learning-based methods for image quality assessment (IQA). Due to its subjective nature, it is necessary to estimate and guarantee the consistency of the IQA process, a characteristic lacking in the mean opinion scores (MOS) widely used for crowdsourcing IQA. In addition, existing blind IQA (BIQA) datasets pay little attention to the difficulty of cross-content assessment, which may degrade the quality of annotations. This paper introduces PIQ23, a portrait-specific IQA dataset of 5116 images of 50 predefined scenarios acquired by 100 smartphones, covering a high variety of brands, models, and use cases. The dataset includes individuals of various genders and ethnicities who have given explicit and informed consent for their photographs to be used in public research. It is annotated by pairwise comparisons (PWC) collected from over 30 image quality experts for three image attributes: face detail preservation, face target exposure, and overall image quality. An in-depth statistical analysis of these annotations allows us to evaluate their consistency over PIQ23. Finally, we show through an extensive comparison with existing baselines that semantic information (image context) can be used to improve IQA predictions.",True,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/papers/Fu_You_Do_Not_Need_Additional_Priors_or_Regularizers_in_Retinex-Based_CVPR_2023_paper.pdf

This typically involves digital painters using a paint bucket tool to manually color each segment enclosed by lines based on RGB values predetermined by a color designer. This frame-by-frame process is both arduous and time-intensive. Current automated methods mainly focus on segment matching. This technique migrates colors from a reference to the target frame by aligning features within line-enclosed segments across frames. However issues like occlusion and wrinkles in animations often disrupt these direct correspondences leading to mismatches. In this work we introduce a new learning-based inclusion matching pipeline which directs the network to comprehend the inclusion relationships between segments rather than relying solely on direct visual correspondences. Our method features a two-stage pipeline that integrates a coarse color warping module with an inclusion matching module enabling more nuanced and accurate colorization. To facilitate the training of our network we also develope a unique dataset referred to as PaintBucket-Character.

CVPR-2024-3,CVPR,2024,Leveraging Frame Affinity for sRGB-to-RAW Video De-rendering,"Chen Zhang, Wencheng Han, Yang Zhou, Jianbing Shen, Cheng-zhong Xu, Wentao Liu",Unprocessed RAW video has shown distinct advantages over sRGB video in video editing and computer vision tasks. However capturing RAW video is challenging due to limitations in bandwidth and storage. Various methods have been proposed to address similar issues in single image RAW capture through de-rendering. These methods utilize both the metadata and the sRGB image to perform sRGB-to-RAW de-rendering and recover high-quality single-frame RAW data. However metadata-based methods always require additional computation for online metadata generation imposing severe burden on mobile camera device for high frame rate RAW video capture. To address this issue we propose a framework that utilizes frame affinity to achieve high-quality sRGB-to-RAW video reconstruction. Our approach consists of two main steps. The first step temporal affinity prior extraction uses motion information between adjacent frames to obtain a reference RAW image. The second step spatial feature fusion and mapping learns a pixel-level mapping function using scene-specific and position-specific features provided by the previous frame. Our method can be easily applied to current mobile camera equipment without complicated adaptations or added burden. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach we introduce the first RAW Video De-rendering Benchmark.

First this use may be restricted due to copyright and license on the training images and privacy laws. Second these datasets and models may incorporate societal and ethical biases. Formula-driven supervised learning (FDSL) enables model pre-training to circumvent these issues. This consists of generating a synthetic image dataset based on mathematical formulae and pre-training the model on it. In this work we propose novel FDSL datasets based on Mandelbulb Variations. These datasets contain RGB images that are projections of colored objects deriving from the 3D Mandelbulb fractal. Pre-training ResNet-50 on one of our proposed datasets MandelbulbVAR-1k enables an average top-1 accuracy over target classification datasets that is at least 1% higher than pre-training on existing FDSL datasets.

Patel, Xiaohua Xie, Jianhaung Lai",Existing person re-identification methods have achieved remarkable advances in appearance-based identity association across homogeneous cameras such as ground-ground matching. However as a more practical scenario aerial-ground person re-identification (AGPReID) among heterogeneous cameras has received minimal attention. To alleviate the disruption of discriminative identity representation by dramatic view discrepancy as the most significant challenge in AGPReID the view-decoupled transformer (VDT) is proposed as a simple yet effective framework. Two major components are designed in VDT to decouple view-related and view-unrelated features namely hierarchical subtractive separation and orthogonal loss where the former separates these two features inside the VDT and the latter constrains these two to be independent. In addition we contribute a large-scale AGPReID dataset called CARGO consisting of five/eight aerial/ground cameras 5000 identities and 108563 images. Experiments on two datasets show that VDT is a feasible and effective solution for AGPReID surpassing the previous method on mAP/Rank1 by up to 5.0%/2.7% on CARGO and 3.7%/5.2% on AG-ReID keeping the same magnitude of computational complexity.

This makes them inconsistent with human evaluation as human perception cares about both overall and detailed shape. In this paper we propose an analytic metric named Spectrum Area Under the Curve Difference (SAUCD) that demonstrates better consistency with human evaluation. To compare the difference between two shapes we first transform the 3D mesh to the spectrum domain using the discrete Laplace-Beltrami operator and Fourier transform. Then we calculate the Area Under the Curve (AUC) difference between the two spectrums so that each frequency band that captures either the overall or detailed shape is equitably considered. Taking human sensitivity across frequency bands into account we further extend our metric by learning suitable weights for each frequency band which better aligns with human perception. To measure the performance of SAUCD we build a 3D mesh evaluation dataset called Shape Grading along with manual annotations from more than 800 subjects. By measuring the correlation between our metric and human evaluation we demonstrate that SAUCD is well aligned with human evaluation and outperforms previous 3D mesh metrics.,True,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Li_A_Video_is_Worth_256_Bases_Spatial-Temporal_Expectation-Maximization_Inversion_for_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf

However the more complex interaction-oriented attention arising from the comprehension of interactions between instances by human observers remains largely unexplored. This is equally crucial for advancing human-machine interaction and human-centered artificial intelligence. To bridge this gap we first collect a novel gaze fixation dataset named IG comprising 530000 fixation points across 740 diverse interaction categories capturing visual attention during human observers' cognitive processes of interactions. Subsequently we introduce the zero-shot interaction-oriented attention prediction task (ZeroIA) which challenges models to predict visual cues for interactions not encountered during training. Thirdly we present the Interactive Attention model (IA) designed to emulate human observers' cognitive processes to tackle the ZeroIA problem. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed IA outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches in both ZeroIA and fully supervised settings.

Despite notable progress in video deblurring works it is still a challenging problem because of the loss of motion information during the duration of the exposure time. Since event cameras can capture clear motion information asynchronously with high temporal resolution several works exploit the event camera for deblurring as they can provide abundant motion information. However despite these approaches there were few cases of actively exploiting the long-range temporal dependency of videos. To tackle these deficiencies we present an event-based video deblurring framework by actively utilizing temporal information from videos. To be specific we first introduce a frequency-based cross-modal feature enhancement module. Second we propose event-guided video alignment modules by considering the valuable characteristics of the event and videos. In addition we designed a hybrid camera system to collect the first real-world event-based video deblurring dataset.

However current benchmark datasets lack multi-modal point cloud image and language data pairs. Recent approaches utilize visual instruction learning and cross-modal prompt engineering to expand vision-language models into this domain. In this paper we propose a new vision-language benchmark that can be used to finetune traffic and HD map domain-specific foundation models. Specifically we annotate and leverage large-scale broad-coverage traffic and map data extracted from huge HD map annotations and use CLIP and LLaMA-2 / Vicuna to finetune a baseline model with instruction-following data. Our experimental results across various algorithms reveal that while visual instruction-tuning large language models (LLMs) can effectively learn meaningful representations from MAPLM-QA there remains significant room for further advancements. To facilitate applying LLMs and multi-modal data into self-driving research we will release our visual-language QA data and the baseline models at GitHub.com/LLVM-AD/MAPLM.,True,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Steitz_Adapters_Strike_Back_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf

Taking a step toward understanding this human ability we introduce EgoExoLearn a large-scale dataset that emulates the human demonstration following process in which individuals record egocentric videos as they execute tasks guided by demonstration videos. Focusing on the potential applications of daily assistance and professional support EgoExoLearn contains egocentric and demonstration video data spanning 120 hours captured in daily life scenarios and specialized laboratories. Along with the videos we record high-quality gaze data and provide detailed multimodal annotations formulating a playground for modeling the human ability to bridge asynchronous procedural actions from different viewpoints. To this end we present benchmarks such as cross-view association cross-view action planning and cross-view referenced skill assessment along with detailed analysis. We expect EgoExoLearn can serve as an important resource for bridging the actions across views thus paving the way for creating AI agents capable of seamlessly learning by observing humans in the real world.

However a majority of these visually-tuned models struggle to comprehend the textual content embedded in images primarily due to the limitation of training data. In this work we introduce TRINS: a Text-Rich image1 INStruction dataset with the objective of enhancing the reading ability of the multimodal large language model. TRINS is built upon LAION 2 using hybrid data annotation strategies that include machine-assisted and human-assisted annotation process. It contains 39153 text-rich images captions and 102437 questions. Specifically we show that the number of words per annotation in TRINS is significantly longer than that of related datasets providing new challenges. Furthermore we introduce a simple and effective architecture called a Language-Vision Reading Assistant (LaRA) which is good at understanding textual content within images. LaRA outperforms existing state-of-the-art multimodal large language models on the TRINS dataset as well as other classical benchmarks.

However exsiting datasets created using the Atmospheric Scattering Model (ASM) or real-time rendering engines often struggle to produce photo-realistic foggy images that accurately mimic the actual imaging process. This limitation hinders the effective generalization of models from synthetic to real data. In this paper we introduce an end-to-end simulation pipeline designed to generate photo-realistic foggy images. This pipeline comprehensively considers the entire physically-based foggy scene imaging process closely aligning with real-world image capture methods. Based on this pipeline we present a new synthetic fog dataset named SynFog which features both sky light and active lighting conditions as well as three levels of fog density. Experimental results demonstrate that models trained on SynFog exhibit superior performance in visual perception and detection accuracy compared to others when applied to real-world foggy images.,True,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Fan_Adaptive_Slot_Attention_Object_Discovery_with_Dynamic_Slot_Number_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf

(ii) the diverse and complicated hybrid distortions are hard to distinguish. To tackle the above challenges and assist in the development of short-form videos we establish the first large-scale Kwai short Video database for Quality assessment termed KVQ which comprises 600 user-uploaded short videos and 3600 processed videos through the diverse practical processing workflows including pre-processing transcoding and enhancement. Among them the absolute quality score of each video and partial ranking score among indistinguish samples are provided by a team of professional researchers specializing in image processing. Based on this database we propose the first short-form video quality evaluator i.e. KSVQE which enables the quality evaluator to identify the quality-determined semantics with the content understanding of large vision language models (i.e. CLIP) and distinguish the distortions with the distortion under- standing module. Experimental results have shown the effectiveness of KSVQE on our KVQ database and popular VQA databases.

MM-AU contains 11727 in-the-wild ego-view accident videos each with temporally aligned text descriptions. We annotate over 2.23 million object boxes and 58650 pairs of video-based accident reasons covering 58 accident categories. MM-AU supports various accident understanding tasks particularly multimodal video diffusion to understand accident cause-effect chains for safe driving. With MM-AU we present an Abductive accident Video understanding framework for Safe Driving perception (AdVersa-SD). AdVersa-SD performs video diffusion via an Object-Centric Video Diffusion (OAVD) method which is driven by an abductive CLIP model. This model involves a contrastive interaction loss to learn the pair co-occurrence of normal near-accident accident frames with the corresponding text descriptions such as accident reasons prevention advice and accident categories. OAVD enforces the object region learning while fixing the content of the original frame background in video generation to find the dominant objects for certain accidents. Extensive experiments verify the abductive ability of AdVersa-SD and the superiority of OAVD against the state-of-the-art diffusion models. Additionally we provide careful benchmark evaluations for object detection and accident reason answering since AdVersa-SD relies on precise object and accident reason information.,True,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Haydarov_Adversarial_Text_to_Continuous_Image_Generation_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf

By employing nanosecond-scale gates existing sensors are capable of capturing mega-pixel gated images delivering dense depth improving on today's LiDAR sensors in spatial resolution and depth precision. Although gated depth estimation methods deliver a million of depth estimates per frame their resolution is still an order below existing RGB imaging methods. In this work we combine high-resolution stereo HDR RCCB cameras with gated imaging allowing us to exploit depth cues from active gating multi-view RGB and multi-view NIR sensing -- multi-view and gated cues across the entire spectrum. The resulting capture system consists only of low-cost CMOS sensors and flood-illumination. We propose a novel stereo-depth estimation method that is capable of exploiting these multi-modal multi-view depth cues including the active illumination that is measured by the RCCB camera when removing the IR-cut filter. The proposed method achieves accurate depth at long ranges outperforming the next best existing method by 39% for ranges of 100 to 220 m in MAE on accumulated LiDAR ground-truth.

The dataset contains high-resolution photographs of windows selected from locations around the world with 89318 individual window crops showcasing diverse geometric and material characteristics. We evaluate a procedural model by training semantic segmentation networks on both synthetic and real images and then comparing their performances on a shared test set of real images. Specifically we measure the difference in mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) and determine the effective number of real images to match synthetic data's training performance. We design a baseline procedural model as a benchmark and provide 21290 synthetically generated images. By tuning the procedural model key factors are identified which significantly influence the model's fidelity in replicating real-world scenarios. Importantly we highlight the challenge of procedural modeling using current techniques especially in their ability to replicate the spatial semantics of real-world scenarios. This insight is critical because of the potential of procedural models to bridge hidden scene aspects such as depth reflectivity material properties and lighting conditions.,True,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Ling_Align_Your_Gaussians_Text-to-4D_with_Dynamic_3D_Gaussians_and_Composed_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf

However existing methods rely on expensive 3D-annotated samples for fully-supervised training restricting their application to large-scale cross-city scenarios. In this work we propose MLS-BRN a multi-level supervised building reconstruction network that can flexibly utilize training samples with different annotation levels to achieve better reconstruction results in an end-to-end manner. To alleviate the demand on full 3D supervision we design two new modules Pseudo Building Bbox Calculator and Roof-Offset guided Footprint Extractor as well as new tasks and training strategies for different types of samples. Experimental results on several public and new datasets demonstrate that our proposed MLS-BRN achieves competitive performance using much fewer 3D-annotated samples and significantly improves the footprint extraction and 3D reconstruction performance compared with current state-of-the-art.

To bridge this gap we introduce PixelLM an effective and efficient LMM for pixel-level reasoning and understanding. Central to PixelLM are a novel lightweight pixel decoder and a comprehensive segmentation codebook. The decoder efficiently produces masks from the hidden embeddings of the codebook tokens which encode detailed target-relevant information. With this design PixelLM harmonizes with the structure of popular LMMs and avoids the need for additional costly segmentation models. Furthermore we propose a token fusion method to enhance the model's ability to differentiate between multiple targets leading to substantially improved mask quality. To advance research in this area we construct MUSE a high-quality multi-target reasoning segmentation benchmark. PixelLM excels across various pixel-level image reasoning and understanding tasks outperforming well-established methods in multiple benchmarks including MUSE and multi-referring segmentation.

Despite many SLAM datasets have been released current SLAM solutions still struggle to have sustained and resilient performance. One major issue is the absence of high-quality datasets including diverse all-weather conditions and a reliable metric for assessing robustness. This limitation significantly restricts the scalability and generalizability of SLAM technologies impacting their development validation and deployment. To address this problem we present SubT-MRS an extremely challenging real-world dataset designed to push SLAM towards all-weather environments to pursue the most robust SLAM performance. It contains multi-degraded environments including over 30 diverse scenes such as structureless corridors varying lighting conditions and perceptual obscurants like smoke and dust; multimodal sensors such as LiDAR fisheye camera IMU and thermal camera; and multiple locomotions like aerial legged and wheeled robots.

CVPR-2024-166,CVPR,2024,Close Imitation of Expert Retouching for Black-and-White Photography,"Seunghyun Shin, Jisu Shin, Jihwan Bae, Inwook Shim, Hae-Gon Jeon",Since the widespread availability of cameras black-and-white (BW)photography has been a popular choice for artistic and aesthetic expression. It highlights the main subject in varying tones of gray creating various effects such as drama and contrast. However producing BW photography often demands high-end cameras or photographic editing from experts. Even the experts prefer different styles depending on the subject or even the same subject when taking grayscale photos or converting color images to BW. It is thus questionable which approach is better. To imitate the artistic values of decolorized images this paper introduces a deep metric learning framework with a novel subject-style specified proxy and a large-scale BW dataset. Our proxy-based decolorization utilizes a hierarchical proxy-based loss and a hierarchical bilateral grid network to mimic the experts' retouching scheme. The proxy-based loss captures both expert-discriminative and classsharing characteristics while the hierarchical bilateral grid network enables imitating spatially-variant retouching by considering both global and local scene contexts. Our dataset including color and BW images edited by three experts demonstrates the scalability of our method which can be further enhanced by constructing additional proxies from any set of BW photos like Internet downloaded figures. Our Experiments show that our framework successfully produce visually-pleasing BW images from color ones as evaluated by user preference with respect to artistry and aesthetics.,True,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Chen_AnyDoor_Zero-shot_Object-level_Image_Customization_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf

We first physically model the imaging of industrial materials covered by the film. Considering the specular highlight from the film can be effectively recorded by the polarized camera we build a practical dataset with polarization information containing paired data with and without transparent film. We aim to remove interference from the film (specular highlights and other degradations) with an end-to-end framework. To locate the specular highlight we use an angle estimation network to optimize the polarization angle with the minimized specular highlight. The image with minimized specular highlight is set as a prior for supporting the reconstruction network. Based on the prior and the polarized images the reconstruction network can decouple all degradations from the film.

However current surveillance video tasks mainly focus on classifying and localizing anomalous events. Existing methods are limited to detecting and classifying the predefined events with unsatisfactory semantic understanding although they have obtained considerable performance. To address this issue we propose a new research direction of surveillance video-and-language understanding(VALU) and construct the first multimodal surveillance video dataset.

Our newly annotated dataset UCA (UCF-Crime Annotation) contains 23542 sentences with an average length of 20 words and its annotated videos are as long as 110.7 hours. Furthermore we benchmark SOTA models for four multimodal tasks on this newly created dataset which serve as new baselines for surveillance VALU. Through experiments we find that mainstream models used in previously public datasets perform poorly on surveillance video demonstrating new challenges in surveillance VALU.

Traditional SfM systems typically rely on the successful detection of repeatable keypoints across multiple views as the first step which is difficult for texture-poor scenes and poor keypoint detection may break down the whole SfM system. We propose a detector-free SfM framework to draw benefits from the recent success of detector-free matchers to avoid the early determination of keypoints while solving the multi-view inconsistency issue of detector-free matchers. Specifically our framework first reconstructs a coarse SfM model from quantized detector-free matches. Then it refines the model by a novel iterative refinement pipeline which iterates between an attention-based multi-view matching module to refine feature tracks and a geometry refinement module to improve the reconstruction accuracy. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms existing detector-based SfM systems on common benchmark datasets.

Yang, Anurag Ranjan, Jen-Hao Rick Chang, Raviteja Vemulapalli, Oncel Tuzel",We consider the task of animating 3D facial geometry from speech signal. Existing works are primarily deterministic focusing on learning a one-to-one mapping from speech signal to 3D face meshes on small datasets with limited speakers. While these models can achieve high-quality lip articulation for speakers in the training set they are unable to capture the full and diverse distribution of 3D facial motions that accompany speech in the real world. Importantly the relationship between speech and facial motion is one-to-many containing both inter-speaker and intra-speaker variations and necessitating a probabilistic approach. In this paper we identify and address key challenges that have so far limited the development of probabilistic models: lack of datasets and metrics that are suitable for training and evaluating them as well as the difficulty of designing a model that generates diverse results while remaining faithful to a strong conditioning signal as speech. We first propose large-scale benchmark datasets and metrics suitable for probabilistic modeling. Then we demonstrate a probabilistic model that achieves both diversity and fidelity to speech outperforming other methods across the proposed benchmarks. Finally we showcase useful applications of probabilistic models trained on these large-scale datasets: we can generate diverse speech-driven 3D facial motion that matches unseen speaker styles extracted from reference clips; and our synthetic meshes can be used to improve the performance of downstream audio-visual models.,True,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Huang_Attribute-Guided_Pedestrian_Retrieval_Bridging_Person_Re-ID_with_Internal_Attribute_Variability_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf

However such general-domain VLMs perform poorly for Remote Sensing (RS) scenarios leading to inaccurate or fabricated information when presented with RS domain-specific queries. Such a behavior emerges due to the unique challenges introduced by RS imagery. For example to handle high-resolution RS imagery with diverse scale changes across categories and many small objects region-level reasoning is necessary alongside holistic scene interpretation. Furthermore the lack of domain-specific multimodal instruction following data as well as strong backbone models for RS make it hard for the models to align their behavior with user queries. To address these limitations we propose GeoChat - the first versatile remote sensing VLM that offers multitask conversational capabilities with high-resolution RS images. Specifically GeoChat can not only answer image-level queries but also accepts region inputs to hold region-specific dialogue. Furthermore it can visually ground objects in its responses by referring to their spatial coordinates. To address the lack of domain-specific datasets we generate a novel RS multimodal instruction-following dataset by extending image-text pairs from existing diverse RS datasets. Leveraging this rich dataset we fine-tune our remote sensing VLM based on the LLaVA-1.5 architecture. We establish a comprehensive benchmark for RS multitask conversations and compare with a number of baseline methods. GeoChat demonstrates robust zero-shot performance on various remote sensing tasks e.g. image and region captioning visual question answering scene classification visually grounded conversations and referring object detection.

However even the highest quality of available curated captions are far too short to capture the rich visual detail in an image. To show the value of dense and highly-aligned image-text pairs we collect the Densely Captioned Images (DCI) dataset containing 8012 natural images human-annotated with mask-aligned descriptions averaging above 1000 words each. With precise and reliable captions associated with specific parts of an image we can evaluate vision-language models' (VLMs) understanding of image content with a novel task that matches each caption with its corresponding subcrop. As current models are often limited to 77 text tokens we also introduce a summarized version (sDCI) in which each caption length is limited. We show that modern techniques that make progress on standard benchmarks do not correspond with significant improvement on our sDCI based benchmark. Lastly we finetune CLIP using sDCI and show significant improvements over the baseline despite a small training set. By releasing the first human annotated dense image captioning dataset we hope to enable the development of new benchmarks or fine-tuning recipes for the next generation of VLMs to come.,True,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Shabanov_BANF_Band-Limited_Neural_Fields_for_Levels_of_Detail_Reconstruction_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf

In contrast for untrimmed videos the sound duration start- and end-sounding time positions and visual deformation of audible objects vary significantly. Therefore we observed that current AVS models trained on trimmed videos might struggle to segment sounding objects in long videos. To investigate the feasibility of grounding audible objects in videos along both temporal and spatial dimensions we introduce the Long-Untrimmed Audio-Visual Segmentation dataset (LU-AVS) which includes precise frame-level annotations of sounding emission times and provides exhaustive mask annotations for all frames. Considering that pixel-level annotations are difficult to achieve in some complex scenes we also provide the bounding boxes to indicate the sounding regions. Specifically LU-AVS contains 10M mask annotations across 6.6K videos and 11M bounding box annotations across 7K videos. Compared with the existing datasets LU-AVS videos are on average 4 8 times longer with the silent duration being 3 15 times greater. Furthermore we try our best to adapt some baseline models that were originally designed for audio-visual-relevant tasks to examine the challenges of our newly curated LU-AVS. Through comprehensive evaluation we demonstrate the challenges of LU-AVS compared to the ones containing trimmed videos.

CVPR-2024-198,CVPR,2024,VTQA: Visual Text Question Answering via Entity Alignment and Cross-Media Reasoning,"Kang Chen, Xiangqian Wu",Achieving the optimal form of Visual Question Answering mandates a profound grasp of understanding grounding and reasoning within the intersecting domains of vision and language. Traditional VQA benchmarks have predominantly focused on simplistic tasks such as counting visual attributes and object detection which do not necessitate intricate cross-modal information understanding and inference. Motivated by the need for a more comprehensive evaluation we introduce a novel dataset comprising 23781 questions derived from 10124 image-text pairs. Specifically the task of this dataset requires the model to align multimedia representations of the same entity to implement multi-hop reasoning between image and text and finally use natural language to answer the question. Furthermore we evaluate this VTQA dataset comparing the performance of both state-of-the-art VQA models and our proposed baseline model the Key Entity Cross-Media Reasoning Network (KECMRN). The VTQA task poses formidable challenges for traditional VQA models underscoring its intrinsic complexity. Conversely KECMRN exhibits a modest improvement signifying its potential in multimedia entity alignment and multi-step reasoning. Our analysis underscores the diversity difficulty and scale of the VTQA task compared to previous multimodal QA datasets. In conclusion we anticipate that this dataset will serve as a pivotal resource for advancing and evaluating models proficient in multimedia entity alignment multi-step reasoning and open-ended answer generation.

This work aims to provide a practical tool for analyzing 3D scenes in the context of aerial surveying and mapping without the need for user annotations. Our approach is based on a probabilistic reconstruction model that decomposes an input 3D point cloud into a small set of learned prototypical 3D shapes. The resulting reconstruction is visually interpretable and can be used to perform unsupervised instance and low-shot semantic segmentation of complex scenes. We demonstrate the usefulness of our model on a novel dataset of seven large aerial LiDAR scans from diverse real-world scenarios.

This paradigm shows promising zero-shot results in various natural language processing tasks but is still unexplored in vision emotion understanding. In this work we focus on enhancing the model's proficiency in understanding and adhering to instructions related to emotional contexts. Initially we identify key visual clues critical to visual emotion recognition. Subsequently we introduce a novel GPT-assisted pipeline for generating emotion visual instruction data effectively addressing the scarcity of annotated instruction data in this domain. Expanding on the groundwork established by InstructBLIP our proposed EmoVIT architecture incorporates emotion-specific instruction data leveraging the powerful capabilities of Large Language Models to enhance performance. Through extensive experiments our model showcases its proficiency in emotion classification adeptness in affective reasoning and competence in comprehending humor.

CVPR-2024-217,CVPR,2024,Osprey: Pixel Understanding with Visual Instruction Tuning,"Yuqian Yuan, Wentong Li, Jian Liu, Dongqi Tang, Xinjie Luo, Chi Qin, Lei Zhang, Jianke Zhu",Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have recently achieved impressive general-purpose vision-language capabilities through visual instruction tuning. However current MLLMs primarily focus on image-level or box-level understanding falling short in achieving fine-grained vision-language alignment at pixel level. Besides the lack of mask-based instruction data limits their advancements. In this paper we propose Osprey a mask-text instruction tuning approach to extend MLLMs by incorporating fine-grained mask regions into language instruction aiming at achieving pixel-wise visual understanding. To achieve this goal we first meticulously curate a mask-based region-text dataset with 724K samples and then design a vision-language model by injecting pixel-level representation into LLM. Specifically Osprey adopts a convolutional CLIP backbone as the vision encoder and employs a mask-aware visual extractor to extract precise visual mask features from high resolution input. Experimental results demonstrate Osprey's superiority in various region understanding tasks showcasing its new capability for pixel-level instruction tuning. In particular Osprey can be integrated with Segment Anything Model (SAM) seamlessly to obtain multi-granularity semantics.

However current NeRF-based methods are limited in the capabilities of adding or removing objects. This paper fills the aforementioned gap by proposing a new language-driven method for object manipulation in NeRFs through dataset updates. Specifically to insert an object represented by a set of multi-view images into a background NeRF we use a text-to-image diffusion model to blend the object into the given background across views. The generated images are then used to update the NeRF so that we can render view-consistent images of the object within the background. To ensure view consistency we propose a dataset update strategy that prioritizes the radiance field training based on camera poses in a pose-ordered manner. We validate our method in two case studies: object insertion and object removal. Experimental results show that our method can generate photo-realistic results and achieves state-of-the-art performance in NeRF editing.,True,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Chen_Beyond_Average_Individualized_Visual_Scanpath_Prediction_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
CVPR-2024-223,CVPR,2024,MAGICK: A Large-scale Captioned Dataset from Matting Generated Images using Chroma Keying,"Ryan D. Burgert, Brian L. Price, Jason Kuen, Yijun Li, Michael S. Ryoo",We introduce MAGICK a large-scale dataset of generated objects with high-quality alpha mattes. While image generation methods have produced segmentations they cannot generate alpha mattes with accurate details in hair fur and transparencies. This is likely due to the small size of current alpha matting datasets and the difficulty in obtaining ground-truth alpha. We propose a scalable method for synthesizing images of objects with high-quality alpha that can be used as a ground-truth dataset. A key idea is to generate objects on a single-colored background so chroma keying approaches can be used to extract the alpha. However this faces several challenges including that current text-to-image generation methods cannot create images that can be easily chroma keyed and that chroma keying is an underconstrained problem that generally requires manual intervention for high-quality results. We address this using a combination of generation and alpha extraction methods. Using our method we generate a dataset of 150000 objects with alpha. We show the utility of our dataset by training an alpha-to-rgb generation method that outperforms baselines.

We introduce multi-modal instruction for image generation a task representation articulating a range of generation intents with precision. It uses natural language to amalgamate disparate modalities (e.g. text edge style subject etc.) such that abundant generation intents can be standardized in a uniform format. We then build Instruct-Imagen by fine-tuning a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model with two stages. First we adapt the model using the retrieval-augmented training to enhance model's capabilities to ground its generation on external multi-modal context. Subsequently we fine-tune the adapted model on diverse image generation tasks that requires vision-language understanding (e.g. subject-driven generation etc.) each paired with a multi-modal instruction encapsulating the task's essence. Human evaluation on various image generation datasets reveals that Instruct-Imagen matches or surpasses prior task-specific models in-domain and demonstrates promising generalization to unseen and more complex tasks.

CVPR-2024-236,CVPR,2024,Pose Adapted Shape Learning for Large-Pose Face Reenactment,"Gee-Sern Jison Hsu, Jie-Ying Zhang, Huang Yu Hsiang, Wei-Jie Hong",We propose the Pose Adapted Shape Learning (PASL) for large-pose face reenactment. The PASL framework consists of three modules namely the Pose-Adapted face Encoder (PAE) the Cycle-consistent Shape Generator (CSG) and the Attention-Embedded Generator (AEG). Different from previous approaches that use a single face encoder for identity preservation we propose multiple Pose-Adapted face Encodes (PAEs) to better preserve facial identity across large poses. Given a source face and a reference face the CSG generates a recomposed shape that fuses the source identity and reference action in the shape space and meets the cycle consistency requirement. Taking the shape code and the source as inputs the AEG learns the attention within the shape code and between the shape code and source style to enhance the generation of the desired target face. As existing benchmark datasets are inappropriate for evaluating large-pose face reenactment we propose a scheme to compose large-pose face pairs and introduce the MPIE-LP (Large Pose) and VoxCeleb2-LP datasets as the new large-pose benchmarks. We compared our approach with state-of-the-art methods on MPIE-LP and VoxCeleb2-LP for large-pose performance and on VoxCeleb1 for the common scope of pose variation.,True,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Ye_BigGait_Learning_Gait_Representation_You_Want_by_Large_Vision_Models_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf

The former arises from non-uniform point sampling allowing models to distinguish the density disparities between foreground and background for easier segmentation. The latter results from sampling only 2048 points limiting semantic information and deviating from the real-world practice. To address these issues we introduce a standardized FS-PCS setting upon which a new benchmark is built. Moreover we propose a novel FS-PCS model. While previous methods are based on feature optimization by mainly refining support features to enhance prototypes our method is based on correlation optimization referred to as Correlation Optimization Segmentation (COSeg). Specifically we compute Class-specific Multi-prototypical Correlation (CMC) for each query point representing its correlations to category prototypes. Then we propose the Hyper Correlation Augmentation (HCA) module to enhance CMC. Furthermore tackling the inherent property of few-shot training to incur base susceptibility for models we propose to learn non-parametric prototypes for the base classes during training. The learned base prototypes are used to calibrate correlations for the background class through a Base Prototypes Calibration (BPC) module. Experiments on popular datasets demonstrate the superiority of COSeg over existing methods.

However this approach faces challenges in modeling scene dynamics in urban environments where moving objects of various categories and scales are present. In such settings it becomes crucial to effectively eliminate moving objects to accurately reconstruct static backgrounds. Our research introduces an innovative method termed here as Entity-NeRF which combines the strengths of knowledge-based and statistical strategies. This approach utilizes entity-wise statistics leveraging entity segmentation and stationary entity classification through thing/stuff segmentation. To assess our methodology we created an urban scene dataset masked with moving objects.

A prominent challenge are partial-to-partial shape matching settings which occur when the shapes to match are only observed incompletely (e.g. from 3D scanning). Although partial-to-partial matching is a highly relevant setting in practice it is rarely explored. Our work bridges the gap between existing (rather artificial) 3D full shape matching and partial-to-partial real-world settings by exploiting geometric consistency as a strong constraint. We demonstrate that it is indeed possible to solve this challenging problem in a variety of settings. For the first time we achieve geometric consistency for partial-to-partial matching which is realized by a novel integer non-linear program formalism building on triangle product spaces along with a new pruning algorithm based on linear integer programming. Further we generate a new inter-class dataset for partial-to-partial shape-matching.

Specifically we encapsulate third-person panoramic and front views as well as egocentric monocular/binocular views with rich modalities including video multi-channel audio directional binaural delay location data and textual scene descriptions within each scene captured presenting comprehensive observation of the world. To the best of our knowledge this is the first database that covers multiple viewpoints with multiple data modalities to mimic how daily information is accessed in the real world. Through our benchmark analysis we presented 5 different scene understanding tasks on the proposed 360+x dataset to evaluate the impact and benefit of each data modality and perspective in panoptic scene understanding.

Existing works predominantly rely on visual queries combined with modi- fication text to distinguish relevant videos. However such a strategy struggles to fully preserve the rich query-specific context in retrieved target videos and only represents the target video using visual embedding. We introduce a novel CoVR framework that leverages detailed language descrip- tions to explicitly encode query-specific contextual informa- tion and learns discriminative embeddings of vision only text only and vision-text for better alignment to accurately retrieve matched target videos. Our proposed framework can be flexibly employed for both composed video (CoVR) and image (CoIR) retrieval tasks.

Additionally the color content of the scenes solar zenith angle and population density of different geographies influence the data diversity. These factors conjointly render suboptimal aerial-visual perception of the deep neural network (DNN) models trained primarily on the ground view data including the open-world foundational models. To pave the way for a transformative era of aerial detection we present Multiview Aerial Visual RECognition (MAVREC) a video dataset where we record synchronized scenes from different perspectives --- ground camera and drone-mounted camera. MAVREC consists of around 2.5 hours of industry-standard 2.7K resolution video sequences more than 0.5 million frames and 1.1 million annotated bounding boxes. This makes MAVREC the largest ground and aerial view dataset and the fourth largest among all drone-based datasets across all modalities and tasks. Through our extensive benchmarking on MAVREC we recognize that augmenting object detectors with ground view images from the corresponding geographical location is a superior pre-training strategy for aerial detection. Building on this strategy we benchmark MAVREC with a curriculum-based semi-supervised object detection approach that leverages labeled (ground and aerial) and unlabeled (only aerial) images to enhance aerial detection.,True,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Zhou_Bring_Event_into_RGB_and_LiDAR_Hierarchical_Visual-Motion_Fusion_for_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf

In this work we propose Random Prompt Assisted Weakly-supervised 3D Object Detection termed as Prompt3D a weakly-supervised approach that leverages position-level labels to overcome this challenge. Explicitly our method focuses on enhancing labeling using synthetic scenes crafted from 3D shapes generated via random prompts. First a Synthetic Scene Generation (SSG) module is introduced to assemble synthetic scenes with a curated collection of 3D shapes created via random prompts for each category. These scenes are enriched with automatically generated point-level annotations providing a robust supervisory framework for training the detection algorithm. To enhance the transfer of knowledge from virtual to real datasets we then introduce a Prototypical Proposal Feature Alignment (PPFA) module.

CVPR-2024-285,CVPR,2024,Instance Tracking in 3D Scenes from Egocentric Videos,"Yunhan Zhao, Haoyu Ma, Shu Kong, Charless Fowlkes",Egocentric sensors such as AR/VR devices capture human-object interactions and offer the potential to provide task-assistance by recalling 3D locations of objects of interest in the surrounding environment. This capability requires instance tracking in real-world 3D scenes from egocentric videos (IT3DEgo). We explore this problem by first introducing a new benchmark dataset consisting of RGB and depth videos per-frame camera pose and instance-level annotations in both 2D camera and 3D world coordinates. We present an evaluation protocol which evaluates tracking performance in 3D coordinates with two settings for enrolling instances to track: (1) single-view online enrollment where an instance is specified on-the-fly based on the human wearer's interactions. and (2) multi-view pre-enrollment where images of an instance to be tracked are stored in memory ahead of time. To address IT3DEgo we first re-purpose methods from relevant areas e.g. single object tracking (SOT) -- running SOT methods to track instances in 2D frames and lifting them to 3D using camera pose and depth. We also present a simple method that leverages pretrained segmentation and detection models to generate proposals from RGB frames and match proposals with enrolled instance images. Our experiments show that our method (with no finetuning) significantly outperforms SOT-based approaches in the egocentric setting. We conclude by arguing that the problem of egocentric instance tracking is made easier by leveraging camera pose and using a 3D allocentric (world) coordinate representation.,True,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Yuan_CADTalk_An_Algorithm_and_Benchmark_for_Semantic_Commenting_of_CAD_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf

However conventional robustness benchmarks rely on perturbations in digitized images diverging from distribution shifts occurring in the image acquisition process. To bridge this gap we introduce a new distribution shift dataset ImageNet-ES comprising variations in environmental and camera sensor factors by directly capturing 202k images with a real camera in a controllable testbed. With the new dataset we evaluate out-of-distribution (OOD) detection and model robustness. We find that existing OOD detection methods do not cope with the covariate shifts in ImageNet-ES implying that the definition and detection of OOD should be revisited to embrace real-world distribution shifts. We also observe that the model becomes more robust in both ImageNet-C and -ES by learning environment and sensor variations in addition to existing digital augmentations. Lastly our results suggest that effective shift mitigation via camera sensor control can significantly improve performance without increasing model size.

Among these coral reefs play an important and intricate role often referred to as the rainforests of the sea due to their rich biodiversity and crucial environmental impact. Existing coral analysis due to its technical complexity requires significant manual work from coral biologists therefore hindering scalable and comprehensive studies. In this paper we introduce CoralSCOP the first foundation model designed for the automatic dense segmentation of coral reefs. CoralSCOP is developed to accurately assign labels to different coral entities addressing the challenges in the semantic analysis of coral imagery. Its main objective is to identify and delineate the irregular boundaries between various coral individuals across different granularities such as coral/non-coral growth form and genus. This task is challenging due to the semantic agnostic nature or fixed limited semantic categories of previous generic segmentation methods which fail to adequately capture the complex characteristics of coral structures. By introducing a novel parallel semantic branch CoralSCOP can produce high-quality coral masks with semantics that enable a wide range of downstream coral reef analysis tasks. We demonstrate that CoralSCOP exhibits a strong zero-shot ability to segment unseen coral images. To effectively train our foundation model we propose CoralMask a new dataset with 41297 densely labeled coral images and 330144 coral masks.

Materials are crucial components of virtual relightable assets defining the interaction of light at the surface of geometries. Given their importance significant research effort was dedicated to their representation creation and acquisition. However in the past 6 years most research in material acquisition or generation relied either on the same unique dataset or on company-owned huge library of procedural materials. With this dataset we propose a significantly larger more diverse and higher resolution set of materials than previously publicly available. We carefully discuss the data collection process and demonstrate the benefits of this dataset for material acquisition and generation applications. The complete data further contains metadata with each material's origin license category tags creation method and when available descriptions and physical size as well as 3M+ renderings of the augmented materials in 1K under various environment lightings.

CVPR-2024-313,CVPR,2024,How to Train Neural Field Representations: A Comprehensive Study and Benchmark,"Samuele Papa, Riccardo Valperga, David Knigge, Miltiadis Kofinas, Phillip Lippe, Jan-Jakob Sonke, Efstratios Gavves",Neural fields (NeFs) have recently emerged as a versatile method for modeling signals of various modalities including images shapes and scenes. Subsequently a number of works have explored the use of NeFs as representations for downstream tasks e.g. classifying an image based on the parameters of a NeF that has been fit to it. However the impact of the NeF hyperparameters on their quality as downstream representation is scarcely understood and remains largely unexplored. This is in part caused by the large amount of time required to fit datasets of neural fields.In this work we propose a JAX-based library that leverages parallelization to enable fast optimization of large-scale NeF datasets resulting in a significant speed-up. With this library we perform a comprehensive study that investigates the effects of different hyperparameters on fitting NeFs for downstream tasks. In particular we explore the use of a shared initialization the effects of overtraining and the expressiveness of the network architectures used. Our study provides valuable insights on how to train NeFs and offers guidance for optimizing their effectiveness in downstream applications. Finally based on the proposed library and our analysis we propose Neural Field Arena a benchmark consisting of neural field variants of popular vision datasets including MNIST CIFAR variants of ImageNet and ShapeNetv2. Our library and the Neural Field Arena will be open-sourced to introduce standardized benchmarking and promote further research on neural fields.,True,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Shen_CN-RMA_Combined_Network_with_Ray_Marching_Aggregation_for_3D_Indoor_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf

While there exist large text corpora and image-text pairs high-quality video-text data is much harder to collect. First of all manual labeling is more time-consuming as it requires an annotator to watch an entire video. Second videos have a temporal dimension consist of a number of scenes stacked together and show multiple actions. Accordingly to establish a video dataset with high-quality captions we propose an automatic approach leveraging multimodal inputs such as textual video description subtitles and individual video frames. Specifically we curate 3.8M high-resolution videos from the publicly available HD-VILA-100M dataset. We then split them into semantically consistent video clips and apply multiple cross-modality teacher models to obtain captions for each video. Next we finetune a retrieval model on a small subset where the best caption of each video is manually selected and then employ the model in the whole dataset to select the best caption as the annotation. In this way we get 70M videos paired with high-quality text captions. We dub the dataset as Panda-70M. We show the value of the proposed dataset on three downstream tasks: video captioning video and text retrieval and text-driven video generation. The models trained on the proposed data score substantially better on the majority of metrics across all the tasks.,True,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Zhu_CPGA_Coding_Priors-Guided_Aggregation_Network_for_Compressed_Video_Quality_Enhancement_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf

However existing MLLM benchmarks remain limited to assessing only models' comprehension ability of single image-text inputs failing to keep up with the strides made in MLLMs. A comprehensive benchmark is imperative for investigating the progress and uncovering the limitations of current MLLMs. In this work we categorize the capabilities of MLLMs into hierarchical levels from L_0 to L_4 based on the modalities they can accept and generate and propose SEED-Bench a comprehensive benchmark that evaluates the hierarchical capabilities of MLLMs. Specifically SEED-Bench comprises 24K multiple-choice questions with accurate human annotations which spans 27 dimensions including the evaluation of both text and image generation. Multiple-choice questions with groundtruth options derived from human annotation enables an objective and efficient assessment of model performance eliminating the need for human or GPT intervention during evaluation. We further evaluate the performance of 22 prominent open-source MLLMs and summarize valuable observations. By revealing the limitations of existing MLLMs through extensive evaluations we aim for SEED-Bench to provide insights that will motivate future research towards the goal of General Artificial Intelligence.,True,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Golatkar_CPR_Retrieval_Augmented_Generation_for_Copyright_Protection_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf

However almost all current multi-view systems rely on given ideal camera poses which are unavailable in many real-world scenarios such as autonomous driving. In this work we propose a new robustness benchmark to evaluate the depth estimation system under various noisy pose settings. Surprisingly we find current multi-view depth estimation methods or single-view and multi-view fusion methods will fail when given noisy pose settings. To address this challenge we propose a single-view and multi-view fused depth estimation system which adaptively integrates high-confident multi-view and single-view results for both robust and accurate depth estimations. The adaptive fusion module performs fusion by dynamically selecting high-confidence regions between two branches based on a wrapping confidence map. Thus the system tends to choose the more reliable branch when facing textureless scenes inaccurate calibration dynamic objects and other degradation or challenging conditions. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art multi-view and fusion methods under robustness testing. Furthermore we achieve state-of-the-art performance on challenging benchmarks (KITTI and DDAD) when given accurate pose estimations.

To this end we propose a latent appearance space that parameterizes a texture field on top of a neural parametric model. We constrain predicted color values to be correlated with the underlying geometry such that gradients from RGB effectively influence latent geometry codes during inverse rendering. To increase the representational capacity of our expression space we augment our backward deformation field with hyper-dimensions thus improving color and geometry representation in topologically challenging expressions. Using MonoNPHM as a learned prior we approach the task of 3D head reconstruction using signed distance field based volumetric rendering. By numerically inverting our backward deformation field we incorporated a landmark loss using facial anchor points that are closely tied to our canonical geometry representation. We incorporate a facial landmark loss by numerically inverting our backward deformation field tied with our canonical geometry to observed 2D facial landmarks in posed space. To evaluate the task of dynamic face reconstruction from monocular RGB videos we record 20 challenging Kinect sequences under casual conditions.

Conventional methods capture multiple frames under high frequency illumination patterns or shadows requiring the scene to keep stationary during the image acquisition process. Single-frame methods simplify the capture procedure but yield lower-quality separation results. In this paper we leverage the event camera to facilitate the separation of direct and global components enabling video-rate separation of high quality. In detail we adopt an event camera to record rapid illumination changes caused by the shadow of a line occluder sweeping over the scene and reconstruct the coarse separation results through event accumulation. We then design a network to resolve the noise in the coarse separation results and restore color information. A real-world dataset is collected using a hybrid camera system for network training and evaluation.

Systematically measuring the reliability of photometric stereo methods in handling such complex reflectance necessitates a real-world dataset with quantitatively controlled reflectances. This paper introduces DiLiGenRT the first real-world dataset for evaluating photometric stereo methods under quantified reflectances by manufacturing 54 hemispheres with varying degrees of two reflectance properties: Roughness and Translucency. Unlike qualitative and semantic labels such as diffuse and specular that have been used in previous datasets our quantified dataset allows comprehensive and systematic benchmark evaluations.

However the robustness of DLA models remains underexplored in the literature. To address this we are the first to introduce a robustness benchmark for DLA models which includes 450K document images of three datasets. To cover realistic corruptions we propose a perturbation taxonomy with 12 common document perturbations with 3 severity levels inspired by real-world document processing. Additionally to better understand document perturbation impacts we propose two metrics Mean Perturbation Effect (mPE) for perturbation assessment and Mean Robustness Degradation (mRD) for robustness evaluation. Furthermore we introduce a self-titled model i.e. Robust Document Layout Analyzer (RoDLA) which improves attention mechanisms to boost extraction of robust features. Experiments on the proposed benchmarks (PubLayNet-P DocLayNet-P and M6Doc-P) demonstrate that RoDLA obtains state-of-the-art mRD scores of 115.7 135.4 and 150.4 respectively.

In 2D referring expression tasks this viewpoint is captured unambiguously in the image. However grounding expressions with such spatial language in 3D without viewpoint annotations can be ambiguous. In this paper we investigate the significance of viewpoint information in 3D visual grounding -- introducing a model that explicitly predicts the speaker's viewpoint based on the referring expression and scene. We pretrain this model on a synthetically generated dataset that provides viewpoint annotations and then finetune on 3D referring expression datasets.

However their performance in visual document understanding still leaves much room for improvement. This discrepancy is primarily attributed to the fact that visual document understanding is a fine-grained prediction task. In natural scenes MLLMs typically use low-resolution images leading to a substantial loss of visual information. Furthermore general-purpose MLLMs do not excel in handling document-oriented instructions. In this paper we propose a High-Resolution Visual Document Assistant (HRVDA) which bridges the gap between MLLMs and visual document understanding. This model employs a content filtering mechanism and an instruction filtering module to separately filter out the content-agnostic visual tokens and instruction-agnostic visual tokens thereby achieving efficient model training and inference for high-resolution images. In addition we construct a document-oriented visual instruction tuning dataset and apply a multi-stage training strategy to enhance the model's document modeling capabilities.

While the existing methods enable generating the gestures to follow a single emotion label they overlook that long gesture sequence modeling with emotion transition is more practical in real scenes. In addition the lack of large-scale available datasets with emotional transition speech and corresponding 3D human gestures also limits the addressing of this task. To fulfill this goal we first incorporate the ChatGPT-4 and an audio inpainting approach to construct the high-fidelity emotion transition human speeches. Considering obtaining the realistic 3D pose annotations corresponding to the dynamically inpainted emotion transition audio is extremely difficult we propose a novel weakly supervised training strategy to encourage authority gesture transitions. Specifically to enhance the coordination of transition gestures w.r.t. different emotional ones we model the temporal association representation between two different emotional gesture sequences as style guidance and infuse it into the transition generation. We further devise an emotion mixture mechanism that provides weak supervision based on a learnable mixed emotion label for transition gestures. Last we present a keyframe sampler to supply effective initial posture cues in long sequences enabling us to generate diverse gestures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art models constructed by adapting single emotion-conditioned counterparts on our newly defined emotion transition task and datasets.

By capturing omnidirectional views of a scene these cameras could expedite building environment models that are essential for visual localization. However such an advantage is often overlooked due to the lack of valuable datasets. This paper introduces a new benchmark dataset 360Loc composed of 360^\\\\circ images with ground truth poses for visual localization. We present a practical implementation of 360^\\\\circ mapping combining 360^\\\\circ images with lidar data to generate the ground truth 6DoF poses. 360Loc is the first dataset and benchmark that explores the challenge of cross-device visual positioning involving 360^\\\\circ reference frames and query frames from pinhole ultra-wide FoV fisheye and 360^\\\\circ cameras. We propose a virtual camera approach to generate lower-FoV query frames from 360^\\\\circ images which ensures a fair comparison of performance among different query types in visual localization tasks. We also extend this virtual camera approach to feature matching-based and pose regression-based methods to alleviate the performance loss caused by the cross-device domain gap and evaluate its effectiveness against state-of-the-art baselines. We demonstrate that omnidirectional visual localization is more robust in challenging large-scale scenes with symmetries and repetitive structures.

This high image-generation capability has stimulated the creation of many downstream applications in various areas. However we find that this technology is actually a double-edged sword: We identify a new type of attack called the Natural Denoising Diffusion (NDD) attack based on the finding that state-of-the-art deep neural network (DNN) models still hold their prediction even if we intentionally remove their robust features which are essential to the human visual system (HVS) through text prompts. The NDD attack shows a significantly high capability to generate low-cost model-agnostic and transferable adversarial attacks by exploiting the natural attack capability in diffusion models. To systematically evaluate the risk of the NDD attack we perform a large-scale empirical study with our newly created dataset the Natural Denoising Diffusion Attack (NDDA) dataset. We evaluate the natural attack capability by answering 6 research questions. Through a user study we find that it can achieve an 88% detection rate while being stealthy to 93% of human subjects; we also find that the non-robust features embedded by diffusion models contribute to the natural attack capability. To confirm the model-agnostic and transferable attack capability we perform the NDD attack against the Tesla Model 3 and find that 73% of the physically printed attacks can be detected as stop signs.

However existing roadside perception approaches only focus on the single-infrastructure sensor system which cannot realize a comprehensive understanding of a traffic area because of the limited sensing range and blind spots. Orienting high-quality roadside perception we need Roadside Cooperative Perception (RCooper) to achieve practical area-coverage roadside perception for restricted traffic areas.

Recent approaches favor learning policies from simulated or collected data wherein appropriate actions are more frequently selected when the recognition is accurate. However most recognition modules are developed under the closed-world assumption which makes them ill-equipped to handle unexpected inputs such as the absence of the target object in the current observation. To address this issue we propose treating active recognition as a sequential evidence-gathering process providing by-step uncertainty quantification and reliable prediction under the evidence combination theory. Additionally the reward function developed in this paper effectively characterizes the merit of actions when operating in open-world environments. To evaluate the performance we collect a dataset from an indoor simulator encompassing various recognition challenges such as distance occlusion levels and visibility.

CVPR-2024-444,CVPR,2024,Investigating Compositional Challenges in Vision-Language Models for Visual Grounding,"Yunan Zeng, Yan Huang, Jinjin Zhang, Zequn Jie, Zhenhua Chai, Liang Wang",Pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved high performance on various downstream tasks which have been widely used for visual grounding tasks in a weakly supervised manner. However despite the performance gains contributed by large vision and language pre-training we find that state-of-the-art VLMs struggle with compositional reasoning on grounding tasks. To demonstrate this we propose Attribute Relation and Priority grounding (ARPGrounding) benchmark to test VLMs' compositional reasoning ability on visual grounding tasks. ARPGrounding contains 11425 samples and evaluates the compositional understanding of VLMs in three dimensions: 1) attribute denoting comprehension of objects' properties; 2) relation indicating an understanding of relation between objects; 3) priority reflecting an awareness of the part of speech associated with nouns. Using the ARPGrounding benchmark we evaluate several mainstream VLMs. We empirically find that these models perform quite well on conventional visual grounding datasets achieving performance comparable to or surpassing state-of-the-art methods but showing strong deficiencies in compositional reasoning. Furthermore we propose a composition-aware fine-tuning pipeline demonstrating the potential to leverage cost-effective image-text annotations for enhancing the compositional understanding of VLMs in grounding tasks.,True,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Zhu_CosalPure_Learning_Concept_from_Group_Images_for_Robust_Co-Saliency_Detection_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf

However current models in this domain often struggle with accurately executing user instructions. We present Emu Edit a multi-task image editing model which sets state-of-the-art results in instruction-based image editing. To develop Emu Edit we train it to multi-task across an unprecedented range of tasks such as region-based editing free-form editing and Computer Vision tasks all of which are formulated as generative tasks. Additionally to enhance Emu Edit's multi-task learning abilities we provide it with learned task embeddings which guide the generation process towards the correct edit type. Both these elements are essential for Emu Edit's outstanding performance. Furthermore we show that Emu Edit can generalize to new tasks such as image inpainting super-resolution and compositions of editing tasks with just a few labeled examples. This capability offers a significant advantage in scenarios where high-quality samples are scarce. Lastly to facilitate a more rigorous and informed assessment of instructable image editing models we release a new challenging and versatile benchmark that includes seven different image editing tasks.,True,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Brucker_Cross-spectral_Gated-RGB_Stereo_Depth_Estimation_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf

However due to the challenges in data collection and network designs it remains challenging to achieve real-time full-body capture while being accurate in world space. In this work we introduce ProxyCap a human-centric proxy-to-motion learning scheme to learn world-space motions from a proxy dataset of 2D skeleton sequences and 3D rotational motions. Such proxy data enables us to build a learning-based network with accurate world-space supervision while also mitigating the generalization issues. For more accurate and physically plausible predictions in world space our network is designed to learn human motions from a human-centric perspective which enables the understanding of the same motion captured with different camera trajectories. Moreover a contact-aware neural motion descent module is proposed to improve foot-ground contact and motion misalignment with the proxy observations. With the proposed learning-based solution we demonstrate the first real-time monocular full-body capture system with plausible foot-ground contact in world space even using hand-held cameras.,True,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Guo_CrossMAE_Cross-Modality_Masked_Autoencoders_for_Region-Aware_Audio-Visual_Pre-Training_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf

We hypothesize that state-of-the-art instructional image editing models where outputs are generated based on an input image and an editing instruction could similarly benefit from human feedback as their outputs may not adhere to the correct instructions and preferences of users. In this paper we present a novel framework to harness human feedback for instructional visual editing (HIVE). Specifically we collect human feedback on the edited images and learn a reward function to capture the underlying user preferences. We then introduce scalable diffusion model fine-tuning methods that can incorporate human preferences based on the estimated reward. Besides to mitigate the bias brought by the limitation of data we contribute a new 1.1M training dataset a 3.6K reward dataset for rewards learning and a 1K evaluation dataset to boost the performance of instructional image editing.

In pursuit of constructing the complex tasks into a structured representation OAKINK2 introduces three level of abstraction to organize the manipulation tasks: Affordance Primitive Task and Complex Task. OAKINK2 features on an object-centric perspective for decoding the complex tasks treating them as a sequence of object affordance fulfillment. The first level Affordance outlines the functionalities that objects in the scene can afford the second level Primitive Task describes the minimal interaction units that humans interact with the object to achieve its affordance and the third level Complex Task illustrates how Primitive Tasks are composed and interdependent. OAKINK2 dataset provides multi-view image streams and precise pose annotations for the human body hands and various interacting objects. This extensive collection supports applications such as interaction reconstruction and motion synthesis. Based on the 3-level abstraction of OAKINK2 we explore a task-oriented framework for Complex Task Completion (CTC). CTC aims to generate a sequence of bimanual manipulation to achieve task objectives. Within the CTC framework we employ Large Language Models (LLMs) to decompose the complex task objectives into sequences of Primitive Tasks and have developed a Motion Fulfillment Model that generates bimanual hand motion for each Primitive Task.

In this paper we present LiveHPS a novel single-LiDAR-based approach for scene-level human pose and shape estimation without any limitation of light conditions and wearable devices. In particular we design a distillation mechanism to mitigate the distribution-varying effect of LiDAR point clouds and exploit the temporal-spatial geometric and dynamic information existing in consecutive frames to solve the occlusion and noise disturbance. LiveHPS with its efficient configuration and high-quality output is well-suited for real-world applications. Moreover we propose a huge human motion dataset named FreeMotion which is collected in various scenarios with diverse human poses shapes and translations. It consists of multi-modal and multi-view acquisition data from calibrated and synchronized LiDARs cameras and IMUs.

Despite their impressive performance on public benchmarks existing methods are vulnerable to unusual poses which prevents them from deploying to challenging scenarios such as dance and martial arts. This issue is mainly attributed to the domain gap induced by the data scarcity in relevant cases. Most existing datasets are captured in constrained scenarios and lack samples of such complex movements. For this reason we propose a data collection pipeline comprising automatic crawling precise annotation and hardcase mining. Based on this pipeline we establish a large dataset in a short time. The dataset named HardMo contains 7M images along with precise annotations covering 15 categories of dance and 14 categories of martial arts. Empirically we find that the prediction failure in dance and martial arts is mainly characterized by the misalignment of hand-wrist and foot-ankle. To dig deeper into the two hardcases we leverage the proposed automatic pipeline to filter collected data and construct two subsets named HardMo-Hand and HardMo-Foot. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the annotation pipeline and the data-driven solution to failure cases. Specifically after being trained on HardMo HMR an early pioneering method can even outperform the current state of the art 4DHumans on our benchmarks.,True,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Shao_DeIL_Direct-and-Inverse_CLIP_for_Open-World_Few-Shot_Learning_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
CVPR-2024-524,CVPR,2024,Causal Mode Multiplexer: A Novel Framework for Unbiased Multispectral Pedestrian Detection,"Taeheon Kim, Sebin Shin, Youngjoon Yu, Hak Gu Kim, Yong Man Ro",RGBT multispectral pedestrian detection has emerged as a promising solution for safety-critical applications that require day/night operations. However the modality bias problem remains unsolved as multispectral pedestrian detectors learn the statistical bias in datasets. Specifically datasets in multispectral pedestrian detection mainly distribute between ROTO (day) and RXTO (night) data; the majority of the pedestrian labels statistically co-occur with their thermal features. As a result multispectral pedestrian detectors show poor generalization ability on examples beyond this statistical correlation such as ROTX data. To address this problem we propose a novel Causal Mode Multiplexer (CMM) framework that effectively learns the causalities between multispectral inputs and predictions. Moreover we construct a new dataset (ROTX-MP) to evaluate modality bias in multispectral pedestrian detection. ROTX-MP mainly includes ROTX examples not presented in previous datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed CMM framework generalizes well on existing datasets (KAIST CVC-14 FLIR) and the new ROTX-MP.

However existing works rely heavily on modality-specific encoders which usually differ in architecture and are limited to common modalities. In this paper we present OneLLM an MLLM that aligns eight modalities to language using a unified framework. We achieve this through a unified multimodal encoder and a progressive multimodal alignment pipeline. In detail we first train an image projection module to connect a vision encoder with LLM. Then we build a universal projection module (UPM) by mixing multiple image projection modules and dynamic routing. Finally we progressively align more modalities to LLM with the UPM. To fully leverage the potential of OneLLM in following instructions we also curated a comprehensive multimodal instruction dataset including 2M items from image audio video point cloud depth/normal map IMU and fMRI brain activity.

This limitation is typically addressed through cumbersome prompt engineering scene layout conditioning or image editing techniques which often require hand drawn masks. Nonetheless pre-existing works struggle to take advantage of the natural instance-level compositionality of scenes due to the typically flat nature of rasterized RGB output images. Towards addressing this challenge we introduce MuLAn: a novel dataset comprising over 44K MUlti-Layer ANnotations of RGB images as multi-layer instance-wise RGBA decompositions and over 100K instance images. To build MuLAn we developed a training free pipeline which decomposes a monocular RGB image into a stack of RGBA layers comprising of background and isolated instances. We achieve this through the use of pretrained general-purpose models and by developing three modules: image decomposition for instance discovery and extraction instance completion to reconstruct occluded areas and image re-assembly. We use our pipeline to create MuLAn-COCO and MuLAn-LAION datasets which contain a variety of image decompositions in terms of style composition and complexity. With MuLAn we provide the first photorealistic resource providing instance decomposition and occlusion information for high quality images opening up new avenues for text-to-image generative AI research.

Different scene text tasks need different information but previous representation learning methods use tightly coupled features for all tasks resulting in sub-optimal performance. We propose a Disentangled Representation Learning framework (DARLING) aimed at disentangling these two types of features for improved adaptability in better addressing various downstream tasks (choose what you really need). Specifically we synthesize a dataset of image pairs with identical style but different content. Based on the dataset we decouple the two types of features by the supervision design. Clearly we directly split the visual representation into style and content features the content features are supervised by a text recognition loss while an alignment loss aligns the style features in the image pairs. Then style features are employed in reconstructing the counterpart image via an image decoder with a prompt that indicates the counterpart's content. Such an operation effectively decouples the features based on their distinctive properties. To the best of our knowledge this is the first time in the field of scene text that disentangles the inherent properties of the text images.

To address this gap we introduce GlitchBench a novel benchmark derived from video game quality assurance tasks to test and evaluate the reasoning capabilities of LMMs. Our benchmark is curated from a variety of unusual and glitched scenarios from video games and aims to challenge both the visual and linguistic reasoning powers of LMMs in detecting and interpreting out-of-the-ordinary events.

While the primary focus of deepfake detection has traditionally centered on the design of detection algorithms an investigative inquiry into the generator architectures has remained conspicuously absent in recent years. This paper contributes to this lacuna by rethinking the architectures of CNN-based generator thereby establishing a generalized representation of synthetic artifacts. Our findings illuminate that the up-sampling operator can beyond frequency-based artifacts produce generalized forgery artifacts. In particular the local interdependence among image pixels caused by upsampling operators is significantly demonstrated in synthetic images generated by GAN or diffusion. Building upon this observation we introduce the concept of Neighboring Pixel Relationships(NPR) as a means to capture and characterize the generalized structural artifacts stemming from up-sampling operations. A comprehensive analysis is conducted on an open-world dataset comprising samples generated by 28 distinct generative models.

However existing methods for video-sound generation attempt to directly create sound from visual representations which can be challenging due to the difficulty of aligning visual representations with audio representations. In this paper we present SonicVisionLM a novel framework aimed at generating a wide range of sound effects by leveraging vision-language models(VLMs). Instead of generating audio directly from video we use the capabilities of powerful VLMs. When provided with a silent video our approach first identifies events within the video using a VLM to suggest possible sounds that match the video content. This shift in approach transforms the challenging task of aligning image and audio into more well-studied sub-problems of aligning image-to-text and text-to-audio through the popular diffusion models. To improve the quality of audio recommendations with LLMs we have collected an extensive dataset that maps text descriptions to specific sound effects and developed a time-controlled audio adapter. Our approach surpasses current state-of-the-art methods for converting video to audio enhancing synchronization with the visuals and improving alignment between audio and video components.

Gonzalez, Serena Yeung-Levy",How do two sets of images differ? Discerning set-level differences is crucial for understanding model behaviors and analyzing datasets yet manually sifting through thousands of images is impractical. To aid in this discovery process we explore the task of automatically describing the differences between two sets of images which we term Set Difference Captioning. This task takes in image sets \\\\mathcal D _A and \\\\mathcal D _B and outputs a description that is more often true on \\\\mathcal D _A than \\\\mathcal D _B. We outline a two-stage approach that first proposes candidate difference descriptions from image sets and then re-ranks the candidates by checking how well they can differentiate the two sets. We introduce VisDiff which first captions the images and prompts a language model to propose candidate descriptions then re-ranks these descriptions using CLIP. To evaluate VisDiff we collect VisDiffBench a dataset with 187 paired image sets with ground truth difference descriptions. We apply VisDiff to various domains such as comparing datasets (e.g. ImageNet vs. ImageNetV2) comparing classification models (e.g. zero-shot CLIP vs. supervised ResNet) characterizing differences between generative models (e.g. StableDiffusionV1 and V2) and discovering what makes images memorable.

In real applications it often requires in-context or referring human input for counting target objects. Take urban analysis as an example fine-grained information such as traffic flow in different directions pedestrians and vehicles waiting or moving at different sides of the junction is more beneficial. Current settings of both class-specific and class-agnostic counting treat objects of the same class indifferently which pose limitations in real use cases. To this end we propose a new task named Referring Expression Counting (REC) which aims to count objects with different attributes within the same class. To evaluate the REC task we create a novel dataset named REC-8K which contains 8011 images and 17122 referring expressions. Experiments on REC-8K show that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance compared with several text-based counting methods and an open-set object detection model.

Recent years have witnessed numerous explorations in the field where 2D cameras and 3D LiDARs are mostly employed. Despite their admirable performance they may encounter challenges in adverse weather such as rain and fog. Hopefully 4D millimeter-wave Radar emerges as a promising alternative as its longer wavelength makes it virtually immune to interference from tiny particles of fog and rain. Therefore in this work we propose a novel 4D Radar place recognition model TransLoc4D based on sparse convolution and Transformer structures. Specifically a Minkloc4D backbone is first proposed to leverage the geometric intensity and velocity information from 4D Radar scans. While mainstream 3D LiDAR solutions merely capture geometric structures of point clouds Minkloc4D explores the intensity and velocity properties of 4D Radar scans and demonstrates their effectiveness. After feature extraction a Transformer layer is introduced to enhance local features where linear self-attention captures the long-range dependency of point cloud alleviating its sparsity and noise. To validate TransLoc4D we construct two datasets and set up benchmarks for 4D radar place recognition. Experiments show TransLoc4D is feasible and can robustly deal with dynamic and adverse environments.,True,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Tan_DiffusionRegPose_Enhancing_Multi-Person_Pose_Estimation_using_a_Diffusion-Based_End-to-End_Regression_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf

Moreover we aim to en- sure that a human observer can still recognize the person depicted in these altered avatar images. To achieve this we introduce 'ToonerGAN' a novel approach that utilizes Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to craft person- alized cartoon avatars. The ToonerGAN framework con- sists of a style module and a de-identification module that work together to produce high-resolution realistic cartoon images. For the efficient training of our network we have developed an extensive dataset named 'ToonSet' compris- ing approximately 23000 facial images and their cartoon renditions. Through comprehensive experiments and bench- marking against existing datasets including CelebA-HQ our method demonstrates superior performance in obfus- cating identity while preserving the utility of data. Addi- tionally a user-centric study to explore the effectiveness of ToonerGAN has yielded some compelling observations.,True,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Lu_Direct2.5_Diverse_Text-to-3D_Generation_via_Multi-view_2.5D_Diffusion_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
CVPR-2024-616,CVPR,2024,Learning Vision from Models Rivals Learning Vision from Data,"Yonglong Tian, Lijie Fan, Kaifeng Chen, Dina Katabi, Dilip Krishnan, Phillip Isola",We introduce SynCLR a novel approach for learning visual representations exclusively from synthetic images without any real data. We synthesize a large dataset of image captions using LLMs then use an off-the-shelf text-to-image model to generate multiple images corresponding to each synthetic caption. We perform visual representation learning on these synthetic images via contrastive learning treating images sharing the same caption as positive pairs. The resulting representations demonstrate remarkable transferability competing favorably with other general-purpose visual representation learners such as CLIP and DINO v2 in image classification tasks. Furthermore in dense prediction tasks such as semantic segmentation SynCLR outperforms previous self-supervised methods by a significant margin e.g. improving over MAE and iBOT by 5.0 and 3.1 mIoU on ADE20k for ViT-B/16.,True,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Yuan_Discriminability-Driven_Channel_Selection_for_Out-of-Distribution_Detection_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf

Nevertheless their performance in fine-grained image understanding tasks is still limited. To address this issue this paper proposes a new framework to enhance the fine-grained image understanding abilities of MLLMs. Specifically we present a new method for constructing the instruction tuning dataset at a low cost by leveraging annotations in existing datasets. A self-consistent bootstrapping method is also introduced to extend existing dense object annotations into high-quality referring-expression-bounding-box pairs. These methods enable the generation of high-quality instruction data which includes a wide range of fundamental abilities essential for fine-grained image perception. Moreover we argue that the visual encoder should be tuned during instruction tuning to mitigate the gap between full image perception and fine-grained image perception. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of our method. For instance our model exhibits a 5.2% accuracy improvement over Qwen-VL on GQA and surpasses the accuracy of Kosmos-2 by 24.7% on RefCOCO_val. We have also attained the top rank on the leaderboard of MMBench. This promising performance is achieved by training on only publicly available data making it easily reproducible.

To address this challenge we have created a large dataset BrokenChairs-180K consisting of around 180K images with diverse anomalies geometries and textures paired with 8143 reference 3D shapes. To tackle this task we have proposed a novel transformer-based approach that explicitly learns the correspondence between the query image and reference 3D shape via feature alignment and leverages a customized attention mechanism for anomaly detection.

Addressing this we introduce MicroDiffusion a pioneering tool facilitating high-quality depth-resolved 3D volume reconstruction from limited 2D projections. While existing Implicit Neural Representation (INR) models often yield incomplete outputs and Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) excel at capturing details our method integrates INR's structural coherence with DDPM's fine-detail enhancement capabilities. We pretrain an INR model to transform 2D axially-projected images into a preliminary 3D volume. This pretrained INR acts as a global prior guiding DDPM's generative process through a linear interpolation between INR outputs and noise inputs. This strategy enriches the diffusion process with structured 3D information enhancing detail and reducing noise in localized 2D images.By conditioning the diffusion model on the closest 2D projection MicroDiffusion substantially enhances fidelity in resulting 3D reconstructions surpassing INR and standard DDPM outputs with unparalleled image quality and structural fidelity.

CVPR-2024-640,CVPR,2024,LEMON: Learning 3D Human-Object Interaction Relation from 2D Images,"Yuhang Yang, Wei Zhai, Hongchen Luo, Yang Cao, Zheng-Jun Zha",Learning 3D human-object interaction relation is pivotal to embodied AI and interaction modeling. Most existing methods approach the goal by learning to predict isolated interaction elements e.g. human contact object affordance and human-object spatial relation primarily from the perspective of either the human or the object. Which underexploit certain correlations between the interaction counterparts (human and object) and struggle to address the uncertainty in interactions. Actually objects' functionalities potentially affect humans' interaction intentions which reveals what the interaction is. Meanwhile the interacting humans and objects exhibit matching geometric structures which presents how to interact. In light of this we propose harnessing these inherent correlations between interaction counterparts to mitigate the uncertainty and jointly anticipate the above interaction elements in 3D space. To achieve this we present LEMON (LEarning 3D huMan-Object iNteraction relation) a unified model that mines interaction intentions of the counterparts and employs curvatures to guide the extraction of geometric correlations combining them to anticipate the interaction elements. Besides the 3D Interaction Relation dataset (3DIR) is collected to serve as the test bed for training and evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of LEMON over methods estimating each element in isolation.

Despite the notable progress in action recognition it is still challenging to recognize atomic activities due to a deficiency in holistic understanding of both multiple road users' motions and their contextual information. In this paper we introduce Action-slot a slot attention-based approach that learns visual action-centric representations capturing both motion and contextual information. Our key idea is to design action slots that are capable of paying attention to regions where atomic activities occur without the need for explicit perception guidance. To further enhance slot attention we introduce a background slot that competes with action slots aiding the training process in avoiding unnecessary focus on background regions devoid of activities. Yet the imbalanced class distribution in the existing dataset hampers the assessment of rare activities. To address the limitation we collect a synthetic dataset called TACO which is four times larger than OATS and features a balanced distribution of atomic activities. To validate the effectiveness of our method we conduct comprehensive experiments and ablation studies against various action recognition baselines. We also show that the performance of multi-label atomic activity recognition on real-world datasets can be improved by pretraining representations on TACO.,True,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Chen_Dont_Look_into_the_Dark_Latent_Codes_for_Pluralistic_Image_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf

However conventional 3D modeling with Computer-Aided Design software requires much expertise and is difficult for novice users. We find that AR/VR devices in addition to serving as effective display mediums can offer a promising potential as an intuitive 3D model creation tool especially with the assistance of AI generative models.

CVPR-2024-670,CVPR,2024,Long-Tailed Anomaly Detection with Learnable Class Names,"Chih-Hui Ho, Kuan-Chuan Peng, Nuno Vasconcelos",Anomaly detection (AD) aims to identify defective images and localize their defects (if any). Ideally AD models should be able to detect defects over many image classes; without relying on hard-coded class names that can be uninformative or inconsistent across datasets; learn without anomaly supervision; and be robust to the long-tailed distributions of real-world applications. To address these challenges we formulate the problem of long-tailed AD by introducing several datasets with different levels of class imbalance and metrics for performance evaluation. We then propose a novel method LTAD to detect defects from multiple and long-tailed classes without relying on dataset class names. LTAD combines AD by reconstruction and semantic AD modules. AD by reconstruction is implemented with a transformer-based reconstruction module. Semantic AD is implemented with a binary classifier which relies on learned pseudo class names and a pretrained foundation model. These modules are learned over two phases. Phase 1 learns the pseudo-class names and a variational autoencoder (VAE) for feature synthesis that augments the training data to combat long-tails. Phase 2 then learns the parameters of the reconstruction and classification modules of LTAD. Extensive experiments using the proposed long-tailed datasets show that LTAD substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for most forms of dataset imbalance.

However acquiring PBR materials is costly and requires special apparatus. In this paper we propose a method to extract PBR materials from a single real-world image. We do so in two steps: first we map regions of the image to material concept tokens using a diffusion model allowing the sampling of texture images resembling each material in the scene. Second we leverage a separate network to decompose the generated textures into spatially varying BRDFs (SVBRDFs) offering us readily usable materials for rendering applications. Our approach relies on existing synthetic material libraries with SVBRDF ground truth. It exploits a diffusion-generated RGB texture dataset to allow generalization to new samples using unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA). Our contributions are thoroughly evaluated on synthetic and real-world datasets.

This task presents significant challenges due to three factors: the lack of high-quality datasets fisheye camera distortion and human body self-occlusion. To address these challenges we propose a novel approach that leverages FisheyeViT to extract fisheye image features which are subsequently converted into pixel-aligned 3D heatmap representations for 3D human body pose prediction. For hand tracking we incorporate dedicated hand detection and hand pose estimation networks for regressing 3D hand poses. Finally we develop a diffusion-based whole-body motion prior model to refine the estimated whole-body motion while accounting for joint uncertainties. To train these networks we collect a large synthetic dataset EgoWholeBody comprising 840000 high-quality egocentric images captured across a diverse range of whole-body motion sequences.

Hence existing methods often fail to accurately estimate complex 3D poses from egocentric views. In this work we propose a new transformer-based framework to improve egocentric stereo 3D human pose estimation which leverages the scene information and temporal context of egocentric stereo videos. Specifically we utilize 1) depth features from our 3D scene reconstruction module with uniformly sampled windows of egocentric stereo frames and 2) human joint queries enhanced by temporal features of the video inputs. Our method is able to accurately estimate human poses even in challenging scenarios such as crouching and sitting. Furthermore we introduce two new benchmark datasets i.e. UnrealEgo2 and UnrealEgo-RW (RealWorld). UnrealEgo2 is a large-scale in-the-wild dataset captured in synthetic 3D scenes. UnrealEgo-RW is a real-world dataset captured with our newly developed device. The proposed datasets offer a much larger number of egocentric stereo views with a wider variety of human motions than the existing datasets allowing comprehensive evaluation of existing and upcoming methods.

However generating videos from text is a more challenging task than generating images from text due to the much larger dataset and higher computational cost required. Most existing video generation methods use either a 3D U-Net architecture that considers the temporal dimension or autoregressive generation. These methods require large datasets and are limited in terms of computational costs compared to text-to-image generation. To tackle these challenges we propose a simple but effective novel grid diffusion for text-to-video generation without temporal dimension in architecture and a large text-video paired dataset. We can generate a high-quality video using a fixed amount of GPU memory regardless of the number of frames by representing the video as a grid image.

Despite the latest advancements in camera hardware the mobile camera sensor area cannot be increased significantly due to physical constraints leading to a pixel size of 0.6--2.0 \\\\mum which results in strong image noise even in moderate lighting conditions. In the era of deep learning one can train a CNN model to perform robust image denoising. However there is still a lack of a substantially diverse dataset for this task.

However the complex neuron morphology often leads to over-merge and over-segmentation results. Recent advancements utilize 3D CNNs to predict a 3D affinity map with improved accuracy but suffer from two challenges: high computational cost and limited input size especially for practical deployment for large-scale EM volumes. To address these challenges we propose a novel method to leverage lightweight 2D CNNs for efficient neuron segmentation. Our method employs a 2D Y-shape network to generate two embedding maps from adjacent 2D sections which are then converted into an affinity map by measuring their embedding distance. While the 2D network better captures pixel dependencies inside sections with larger input sizes it overlooks inter-section dependencies. To overcome this we introduce a cross-dimension affinity distillation (CAD) strategy that transfers inter-section dependency knowledge from a 3D teacher network to the 2D student network by ensuring consistency between their output affinity maps. Additionally we design a feature grafting interaction (FGI) module to enhance knowledge transfer by grafting embedding maps from the 2D student onto those from the 3D teacher.

CVPR-2024-735,CVPR,2024,LASO: Language-guided Affordance Segmentation on 3D Object,"Yicong Li, Na Zhao, Junbin Xiao, Chun Feng, Xiang Wang, Tat-seng Chua",Segmenting affordance in 3D data is key for bridging perception and action in robots. Existing efforts mostly focus on the visual side and overlook the affordance knowledge from a semantic aspect. This oversight not only limits their generalization to unseen objects but more importantly hinders their synergy with large language models (LLMs) which are excellent task planners that can decompose an overarching command into agent-actionable instructions. With this regard we propose a novel task Language-guided Affordance Segmentation on 3D Object (LASO) which challenges a model to segment a 3D object's part relevant to a given affordance question. To facilitate the task we contribute a dataset comprising 19751 point-question pairs covering 8434 object shapes and 870 expert-crafted questions. As a pioneer solution we further propose PointRefer which highlights an adaptive fusion module to identify target affordance regions at different scales. To ensure a text-aware segmentation we adopt a set of affordance queries conditioned on linguistic cues to generate dynamic kernels. These kernels are further used to convolute with point features and generate a segmentation mask. Comprehensive experiments and analyses validate PointRefer's effectiveness. With these efforts We hope that LASO can steer the direction of 3D affordance guiding it towards enhanced integration with the evolving capabilities of LLMs.,True,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Xiong_EfficientSAM_Leveraged_Masked_Image_Pretraining_for_Efficient_Segment_Anything_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
CVPR-2024-742,CVPR,2024,SiTH: Single-view Textured Human Reconstruction with Image-Conditioned Diffusion,"Hsuan- I Ho, Jie Song, Otmar Hilliges",A long-standing goal of 3D human reconstruction is to create lifelike and fully detailed 3D humans from single-view images. The main challenge lies in inferring unknown body shapes appearances and clothing details in areas not visible in the images. To address this we propose SiTH a novel pipeline that uniquely integrates an image-conditioned diffusion model into a 3D mesh reconstruction workflow. At the core of our method lies the decomposition of the challenging single-view reconstruction problem into generative hallucination and reconstruction subproblems. For the former we employ a powerful generative diffusion model to hallucinate unseen back-view appearance based on the input images. For the latter we leverage skinned body meshes as guidance to recover full-body texture meshes from the input and back-view images. SiTH requires as few as 500 3D human scans for training while maintaining its generality and robustness to diverse images. Extensive evaluations on two 3D human benchmarks including our newly created one highlighted our method's superior accuracy and perceptual quality in 3D textured human reconstruction.

CVPR-2024-752,CVPR,2024,MIGC: Multi-Instance Generation Controller for Text-to-Image Synthesis,"Dewei Zhou, You Li, Fan Ma, Xiaoting Zhang, Yi Yang",We present a Multi-Instance Generation (MIG) task simultaneously generating multiple instances with diverse controls in one image. Given a set of predefined coordinates and their corresponding descriptions the task is to ensure that generated instances are accurately at the designated locations and that all instances' attributes adhere to their corresponding description. This broadens the scope of current research on Single-instance generation elevating it to a more versatile and practical dimension. Inspired by the idea of divide and conquer we introduce an innovative approach named Multi-Instance Generation Controller (MIGC) to address the challenges of the MIG task. Initially we break down the MIG task into several subtasks each involving the shading of a single instance. To ensure precise shading for each instance we introduce an instance enhancement attention mechanism. Lastly we aggregate all the shaded instances to provide the necessary information for accurately generating multiple instances in stable diffusion (SD). To evaluate how well generation models perform on the MIG task we provide a COCO-MIG benchmark along with an evaluation pipeline. Extensive experiments were conducted on the proposed COCO-MIG benchmark as well as on various commonly used benchmarks. The evaluation results illustrate the exceptional control capabilities of our model in terms of quantity position attribute and interaction.

We present a novel transformer-based method for GFIQA which is aided by two unique mechanisms. First a novel Dual-Set Degradation Representation Learning (DSL) mechanism uses facial images with both synthetic and real degradations to decouple degradation from content ensuring generalizability to real-world scenarios. This self-supervised method learns degradation features on a global scale providing a robust alternative to conventional methods that use local patch information in degradation learning. Second our transformer leverages facial landmarks to emphasize visually salient parts of a face image in evaluating its perceptual quality. We also introduce a balanced and diverse Comprehensive Generic Face IQA (CGFIQA-40k) dataset of 40K images carefully designed to overcome the biases in particular the imbalances in skin tone and gender representation in existing datasets.

To bridge this gap we present URHand the first universal relightable hand model that generalizes across viewpoints poses illuminations and identities. Our model allows few-shot personalization using images captured with a mobile phone and is ready to be photorealistically rendered under novel illuminations. To simplify the personalization process while retaining photorealism we build a powerful universal relightable prior based on neural relighting from multi-view images of hands captured in a light stage with hundreds of identities. The key challenge is scaling the cross-identity training while maintaining personalized fidelity and sharp details without compromising generalization under natural illuminations. To this end we propose a spatially varying linear lighting model as the neural renderer that takes physics-inspired shading as input feature. By removing non-linear activations and bias our specifically designed lighting model explicitly keeps the linearity of light transport. This enables single-stage training from light-stage data while generalizing to real-time rendering under arbitrary continuous illuminations across diverse identities. In addition we introduce the joint learning of a physically based model and our neural relighting model which further improves fidelity and generalization. Extensive experiments show that our approach achieves superior performance over existing methods in terms of both quality and generalizability.

Our generative 3D avatar enables disentangled controls to selectively alter the facial attributes (e.g. hair or nose) while preserving the identity. Our approach consists of two stages: synthetic database generation and constructing a personalized generative avatar. We generate a synthetic video collection of the target identity with varying facial attributes where the videos are synthesized by borrowing the attributes from monocular videos of diverse identities. Then we build a person-specific generative 3D avatar that can modify its attributes continuously while preserving its identity. Through extensive experiments we demonstrate that our method of generating a synthetic database and creating a 3D generative avatar is the most effective in preserving identity while achieving high realism.

Despite current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) being trained on mega-scale datasets recognizing unseen images or understanding novel concepts in a training-free manner remains a challenge. In-Context Learning (ICL) explores training-free few-shot learning where models are encouraged to ""learn to learn"" from limited tasks and generalize to unseen tasks. In this work we propose link-context learning (LCL) which emphasizes ""reasoning from cause and effect"" to augment the learning capabilities of MLLMs. LCL goes beyond traditional ICL by explicitly strengthening the causal relationship between the support set and the query set. By providing demonstrations with causal links LCL guides the model to discern not only the analogy but also the underlying causal associations between data points which empowers MLLMs to recognize unseen images and understand novel concepts more effectively.

This work aims to address this gap by introducing a novel dataset named Extreme Pose Face High-Quality Dataset (EFHQ) which includes a maximum of 450k high-quality images of faces at extreme poses. To produce such a massive dataset we utilize a novel and meticulous dataset processing pipeline to curate two publicly available datasets VFHQ and CelebV-HQ which contain many high-resolution face videos captured in various settings. Our dataset can complement existing datasets on various facial-related tasks such as facial synthesis with 2D/3D-aware GAN diffusion-based text-to-image face generation and face reenactment. Specifically training with EFHQ helps models generalize well across diverse poses significantly improving performance in scenarios involving extreme views confirmed by extensive experiments.

Recognizing this we present msGFM a multisensor geospatial foundation model that effectively unifies data from four key sensor modalities. This integration spans an expansive dataset of two million multisensor images. msGFM is uniquely adept at handling both paired and unpaired sensor data. For data originating from identical geolocations our model employs an innovative cross-sensor pretraining approach in masked image modeling enabling the synthesis of joint representations from diverse sensors. msGFM incorporating four remote sensors upholds strong performance forming a comprehensive model adaptable to various sensor types. msGFM has demonstrated enhanced proficiency in a range of both single-sensor and multisensor downstream tasks.

Snoek",Low-resource settings are well-established in natural lan- guage processing where many languages lack sufficient data for deep learning at scale. However low-resource problems are under-explored in computer vision. In this paper we address this gap and explore the challenges of low-resource image tasks with vision foundation models. We first collect a benchmark of genuinely low-resource image data covering historic maps circuit diagrams and mechanical drawings. These low-resource settings all share three challenges: data scarcity fine-grained differences and the distribution shift from natural images to the specialized domain of interest. While existing foundation models have shown impressive generalizability we find they cannot transfer well to our low-resource tasks. To begin to tackle the challenges of low-resource vision we introduce one simple baseline per challenge. Specifically we i) enlarge the data space by generative models ii) adopt the best sub-kernels to encode local regions for fine-grained difference discovery and iii) learn attention for specialized domains. Experiments on our three low-resource tasks demonstrate our proposals already provide a better baseline than transfer learning data aug- mentation and fine-grained methods.

Notably the established COCO benchmark has propelled the development of modern detection and segmentation systems. However the COCO segmentation benchmark has seen comparatively slow improvement over the last decade. Originally equipped with coarse polygon annotations for thing instances it gradually incorporated coarse superpixel annotations for stuff regions which were subsequently heuristically amalgamated to yield panoptic segmentation annotations. These annotations executed by different groups of raters have resulted not only in coarse segmentation masks but also in inconsistencies between segmentation types. In this study we undertake a comprehensive reevaluation of the COCO segmentation annotations. By enhancing the annotation quality and expanding the dataset to encompass 383K images with more than 5.18M panoptic masks we introduce COCONut the COCO Next Universal segmenTation dataset. COCONut harmonizes segmentation annotations across semantic instance and panoptic segmentation with meticulously crafted high-quality masks and establishes a robust benchmark for all segmentation tasks.

CVPR-2024-892,CVPR,2024,Polarization Wavefront Lidar: Learning Large Scene Reconstruction from Polarized Wavefronts,"Dominik Scheuble, Chenyang Lei, Seung-Hwan Baek, Mario Bijelic, Felix Heide",Lidar has become a cornerstone sensing modality for 3D vision especially for large outdoor scenarios and autonomous driving. Conventional lidar sensors are capable of providing centimeter-accurate distance information by emitting laser pulses into a scene and measuring the time-of-flight (ToF) of the reflection. However the polarization of the received light that depends on the surface orientation and material properties is usually not considered. As such the polarization modality has the potential to improve scene reconstruction beyond distance measurements. In this work we introduce a novel long-range polarization wavefront lidar sensor (PolLidar) that modulates the polarization of the emitted and received light. Departing from conventional lidar sensors PolLidar allows access to the raw time-resolved polarimetric wavefronts. We leverage polarimetric wavefronts to estimate normals distance and material properties in outdoor scenarios with a novel learned reconstruction method. To train and evaluate the method we introduce a simulated and real-world long-range dataset with paired raw lidar data ground truth distance and normal maps.

However the current datasets often collected under single laboratory conditions using complex motion capture equipment and unvarying backgrounds are insufficient. The absence of datasets on variable conditions is stalling the progress of this crucial task. To facilitate the development of 3D pose estimation we present FreeMan the first large-scale multi-view dataset collected under the real- world conditions.

CVPR-2024-895,CVPR,2024,Motion Blur Decomposition with Cross-shutter Guidance,"Xiang Ji, Haiyang Jiang, Yinqiang Zheng",Motion blur is a frequently observed image artifact especially under insufficient illumination where exposure time has to be prolonged so as to collect more photons for a bright enough image. Rather than simply removing such blurring effects recent researches have aimed at decomposing a blurry image into multiple sharp images with spatial and temporal coherence. Since motion blur decomposition itself is highly ambiguous priors from neighbouring frames or human annotation are usually needed for motion disambiguation. In this paper inspired by the complementary exposure characteristics of a global shutter (GS) camera and a rolling shutter (RS) camera we propose to utilize the ordered scanline-wise delay in a rolling shutter image to robustify motion decomposition of a single blurry image. To evaluate this novel dual imaging setting we construct a triaxial system to collect realistic data as well as a deep network architecture that explicitly addresses temporal and contextual information through reciprocal branches for cross-shutter motion blur decomposition. Experiment results have verified the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm as well as the validity of our dual imaging setting.,True,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Zheng_Free3D_Consistent_Novel_View_Synthesis_without_3D_Representation_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf

Maxwell, Sumegha Singhania, Avnish Patel, Rahul Kumar, Heather Fryling, Sihan Li, Haonan Sun, Ping He, Zewen Li",The design of deep network architectures and training methods in computer vision has been well-explored. However in almost all cases the images have been used as provided with little exploration of pre-processing steps beyond normalization and data augmentation. Virtually all images posted on the web or captured by devices are processed for viewing by humans. Is the pipeline used for humans also best for use by computers and deep networks? The human visual system uses logarithmic sensors; differences and sums correspond to ratios and products. Features in log space will be invariant to intensity changes and robust to color balance changes. Log RGB space also reveals structure that is corrupted by typical pre-processing. We explore using linear and log RGB data for training standard backbone architectures on an image classification task using data derived directly from RAW images to guarantee its integrity. We found that networks trained on log RGB data exhibit improved performance on an unmodified test set and invariance to intensity and color balance modifications without additional training or data augmentation. Furthermore we found that the gains from using high quality log data could also be partially or fully realized from data in 8-bit sRGB-JPG format by inverting the sRGB transform and taking the log. These results imply existing databases may benefit from this type of pre-processing. While working with log data we found it was critical to retain the integrity of the log relationships and that networks using log data train best with meta-parameters different than those used for sRGB or linear data.

CVPR-2024-909,CVPR,2024,Bayesian Differentiable Physics for Cloth Digitalization,"Deshan Gong, Ningtao Mao, He Wang",We propose a new method for cloth digitalization. Deviating from existing methods which learn from data captured under relatively casual settings we propose to learn from data captured in strictly tested measuring protocols and find plausible physical parameters of the cloths. However such data is currently absent so we first propose a new dataset with accurate cloth measurements. Further the data size is considerably smaller than the ones in current deep learning due to the nature of the data capture process. To learn from small data we propose a new Bayesian differentiable cloth model to estimate the complex material heterogeneity of real cloths. It can provide highly accurate digitalization from very limited data samples. Through exhaustive evaluation and comparison we show our method is accurate in cloth digitalization efficient in learning from limited data samples and general in capturing material variations.

In practice there is a large domain gap between different hospitals' data such as the variable data quality due to differences in acquisition equipment. In addition accurate annotation information provided by obstetrician experts is always very costly or even unavailable. This study explores the unsupervised domain adaptive fetal cardiac structure detection issue. Existing unsupervised domain adaptive object detection (UDAOD) approaches mainly focus on detecting objects in natural scenes such as Foggy Cityscapes where the structural relationships of natural scenes are uncertain. Unlike all previous UDAOD scenarios we first collected a Fetal Cardiac Structure dataset from two hospital centers called FCS and proposed a multi-matching UDA approach (M3-UDA) including Histogram Matching (HM) Sub-structure Matching (SM) and Global-structure Matching (GM) to better transfer the topological knowledge of anatomical structure for UDA detection in medical scenarios. HM mitigates the domain gap between the source and target caused by pixel transformation. SM fuses the different angle information of the sub-structure to obtain the local topological knowledge for bridging the domain gap of the internal sub-structure. GM is designed to align the global topological knowledge of the whole organ from the source and target domain. Extensive experiments on our collected FCS and CardiacUDA and experimental results show that M3-UDA outperforms existing UDAOD studies significantly.

Currently visual language models for AD generation are limited by a lack of suitable training data and also their evaluation is hampered by using performance measures not specialized to the AD domain. In this paper we make three contributions: (i) We propose two approaches for constructing AD datasets with aligned video data and build training and evaluation datasets using these. These datasets will be publicly released; (ii) We develop a Q-former-based architecture which ingests raw video and generates AD using frozen pre-trained visual encoders and large language models; and (iii) We provide new evaluation metrics to benchmark AD quality that are well matched to human performance.

CVPR-2024-929,CVPR,2024,Harnessing the Power of MLLMs for Transferable Text-to-Image Person ReID,"Wentan Tan, Changxing Ding, Jiayu Jiang, Fei Wang, Yibing Zhan, Dapeng Tao",Text-to-image person re-identification (ReID) retrieves pedestrian images according to textual descriptions. Manually annotating textual descriptions is time-consuming restricting the scale of existing datasets and therefore the generalization ability of ReID models. As a result we study the transferable text-to-image ReID problem where we train a model on our proposed large-scale database and directly deploy it to various datasets for evaluation. We obtain substantial training data via Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Moreover we identify and address two key challenges in utilizing the obtained textual descriptions. First an MLLM tends to generate descriptions with similar structures causing the model to overfit specific sentence patterns. Thus we propose a novel method that uses MLLMs to caption images according to various templates. These templates are obtained using a multi-turn dialogue with a Large Language Model (LLM). Therefore we can build a large-scale dataset with diverse textual descriptions. Second an MLLM may produce incorrect descriptions. Hence we introduce a novel method that automatically identifies words in a description that do not correspond with the image. This method is based on the similarity between one text and all patch token embeddings in the image. Then we mask these words with a larger probability in the subsequent training epoch alleviating the impact of noisy textual descriptions. The experimental results demonstrate that our methods significantly boost the direct transfer text-to-image ReID performance. Benefiting from the pre-trained model weights we also achieve state-of-the-art performance in the traditional evaluation settings.,True,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Huang_G-NeRF_Geometry-enhanced_Novel_View_Synthesis_from_Single-View_Images_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf

Existing methods learn representations based on trajectory labels for individuals which are annotation-expensive. To provide a more realistic reflection of the underlying practical challenge we introduce a weakly supervised VIC task wherein trajectory labels are not provided. Instead two types of labels are provided to indicate traffic entering the field of view (inflow) and leaving the field view (outflow). We also propose the first solution as a baseline that formulates the task as a weakly supervised contrastive learning problem under group-level matching. In doing so we devise an end-to-end trainable soft contrastive loss to drive the network to distinguish inflow outflow and the remaining. To facilitate future study in this direction we generate annotations from the existing VIC datasets SenseCrowd and CroHD and also build a new dataset UAVVIC. Extensive results show that our baseline weakly supervised method outperforms supervised methods and thus little information is lost in the transition to the more practically relevant weakly supervised task.

CVPR-2024-935,CVPR,2024,Tri-Perspective View Decomposition for Geometry-Aware Depth Completion,"Zhiqiang Yan, Yuankai Lin, Kun Wang, Yupeng Zheng, Yufei Wang, Zhenyu Zhang, Jun Li, Jian Yang",Depth completion is a vital task for autonomous driving as it involves reconstructing the precise 3D geometry of a scene from sparse and noisy depth measurements. However most existing methods either rely only on 2D depth representations or directly incorporate raw 3D point clouds for compensation which are still insufficient to capture the fine-grained 3D geometry of the scene. To address this challenge we introduce Tri-Perspective View Decomposition (TPVD) a novel framework that can explicitly model 3D geometry. In particular (1) TPVD ingeniously decomposes the original point cloud into three 2D views one of which corresponds to the sparse depth input. (2) We design TPV Fusion to update the 2D TPV features through recurrent 2D-3D-2D aggregation where a Distance-Aware Spherical Convolution (DASC) is applied. (3) By adaptively choosing TPV affinitive neighbors the newly proposed Geometric Spatial Propagation Network (GSPN) further improves the geometric consistency. As a result our TPVD outperforms existing methods on KITTI NYUv2 and SUN RGBD.

Unlike previous works that rely on scarce 3D datasets or limited 2D collections with imbalanced viewing angles and imprecise pose priors our approach aims to develop a zero-shot 3D generative scheme capable of producing visually realistic geometrically accurate and content-wise diverse 3D humans without relying on pre-existing 3D or 2D assets. To address this challenge we introduce a meticulously crafted workflow that implements accurate physical modeling to learn the enhanced 3D generative model from synthetic 2D data. During inference we integrate optimization modules to bridge the gap between realistic appearances and coarse 3D shapes. Specifically En3D comprises three modules: a 3D generator that accurately models generalizable 3D humans with realistic appearance from synthesized balanced diverse and structured human images; a geometry sculptor that enhances shape quality using multi-view normal constraints for intricate human structure; and a texturing module that disentangles explicit texture maps with fidelity and editability leveraging semantical UV partitioning and a differentiable rasterizer. Experimental results show that our approach significantly outperforms prior works in terms of image quality geometry accuracy and content diversity.

Vision Language Models (VLMs) have shown impressive performance in some VQA benchmarks but struggle with 3D spatial reasoning such as recognizing distances or size differences between physical objects. This limitation may stem from a lack of 3D spatial knowledge in their training data. To address this we propose training VLMs with extensive spatial reasoning data from the internet. Our approach includes developing an automatic 3D spatial VQA data generation framework capable of creating 2 billion VQA examples from 10 million real-world images. We explore various factors in the training process such as data quality training pipeline and VLM architecture. Our work introduces the first Internet-scale 3D spatial reasoning dataset in metric space. By co-training a VLM with this dataset we significantly improve its performance in both qualitative and quantitative spatial VQA.

This capability has a wide range of applications across various fields such as manufacturing and healthcare. The nature of procedural mistakes is open-set since novel types of failures might occur which calls for one-class classifiers trained on correctly executed procedures. However no technique can currently detect open-set procedural mistakes online. We propose PREGO the first online one-class classification model for mistake detection in PRocedural EGOcentric videos. PREGO is based on an online action recognition component to model the current action and a symbolic reasoning module to predict the next actions. Mistake detection is performed by comparing the recognized current action with the expected future one. We evaluate PREGO on two procedural egocentric video datasets Assembly101 and Epic-tent which we adapt for online benchmarking of procedural mistake detection to establish suitable benchmarks thus defining the Assembly101-O and Epic-tent-O datasets respectively.

Importantly the number of channels can range from one to a dozen and their correlation is often comparatively much lower than RGB as each of them brings specific information content. This aspect is largely overlooked by methods designed out of the bioimage field and current solutions mostly focus on intra-channel spatial attention often ignoring the relationship between channels yet crucial in most biological applications. Importantly the variable channel type and count prevent the projection of several experiments to a unified representation for large scale pre-training. In this study we propose ChAda-ViT a novel Channel Adaptive Vision Transformer architecture employing an Inter-Channel Attention mechanism on images with an arbitrary number order and type of channels. We also introduce IDRCell100k a bioimage dataset with a rich set of 79 experiments covering 7 microscope modalities with a multitude of channel types and channel counts varying from 1 to 10 per experiment. Our proposed architecture trained in a self-supervised manner outperforms existing approaches in several biologically relevant downstream tasks. Additionally it can be used to bridge the gap for the first time between assays with different microscopes channel numbers or types by embedding various image and experimental modalities into a unified biological image representation.

Recent generative methods lack lighting control which is crucial to numerous artistic aspects of image generation such as setting the overall mood or cinematic appearance. To overcome these limitations we propose to condition the generation on shading and normal maps. We model the lighting with single bounce shading which includes cast shadows. We first train a shading estimation module to generate a dataset of real-world images and shading pairs. Then we train a control network using the estimated shading and normals as input. Our method demonstrates high-quality image generation and lighting control in numerous scenes.

SeMo-AE is leveraged to generate a diverse synthetic dataset of loose-wear IMU data to augment training for the pose estimation network and significantly improve its accuracy.

With the growing popularity of smartphones and social media applications recognizing portrait mode videos is becoming increasingly important. To this end we have developed the first dataset dedicated to portrait mode video recognition namely PortraitMode-400. The taxonomy of PortraitMode-400 was constructed in a data-driven manner comprising 400 fine-grained categories and rigorous quality assurance was implemented to ensure the accuracy of human annotations. In addition to the new dataset we conducted a comprehensive analysis of the impact of video format (portrait mode versus landscape mode) on recognition accuracy and spatial bias due to the different formats. Furthermore we designed extensive experiments to explore key aspects of portrait mode video recognition including the choice of data augmentation evaluation procedure the importance of temporal information and the role of audio modality.

DriveTrack is motivated by the observation that the accuracy of state-of-the-art trackers depends strongly on visual attributes around the selected keypoints such as texture and lighting. The problem is that these artifacts are especially pronounced in real-world videos but these trackers are unable to train on such scenes due to a dearth of annotations. DriveTrack bridges this gap by building a framework to automatically annotate point tracks on autonomous driving datasets. We release a dataset consisting of 1 billion point tracks across 24 hours of video which is seven orders of magnitude greater than prior real-world benchmarks and on par with the scale of synthetic benchmarks. DriveTrack unlocks new use cases for point tracking in real-world videos. First we show that fine-tuning keypoint trackers on DriveTrack improves accuracy on real-world scenes by up to 7%.

In previous work the amodal segmentation ground truth on real images is usually predicted by manual annotaton and thus is subjective. In contrast we use 3D data to establish an automatic pipeline to determine authentic ground truth amodal masks for partially occluded objects in real images. This pipeline is used to construct an amodal completion evaluation benchmark MP3D-Amodal consisting of a variety of object categories and labels. To better handle the amodal completion task in the wild we explore two architecture variants: a two-stage model that first infers the occluder followed by amodal mask completion; and a one-stage model that exploits the representation power of Stable Diffusion for amodal segmentation across many categories.

However the recent development of IAD approach has encountered certain difficulties due to dataset limitations. On the one hand most of the state-of-the-art methods have achieved saturation (over 99% in AUROC) on mainstream datasets such as MVTec and the differences of methods cannot be well distinguished leading to a significant gap between public datasets and actual application scenarios. On the other hand the research on various new practical anomaly detection settings is limited by the scale of the dataset posing a risk of overfitting in evaluation results. Therefore we propose a large-scale Real-world and multi-view Industrial Anomaly Detection dataset named Real-IAD which contains 150K high-resolution images of 30 different objects an order of magnitude larger than existing datasets. It has a larger range of defect area and ratio proportions making it more challenging than previous datasets. To make the dataset closer to real application scenarios we adopted a multi-view shooting method and proposed sample-level evaluation metrics. In addition beyond the general unsupervised anomaly detection setting we propose a new setting for Fully Unsupervised Industrial Anomaly Detection (FUIAD) based on the observation that the yield rate in industrial production is usually greater than 60% which has more practical application value.

CVPR-2024-1016,CVPR,2024,Traffic Scene Parsing through the TSP6K Dataset,"Peng-Tao Jiang, Yuqi Yang, Yang Cao, Qibin Hou, Ming-Ming Cheng, Chunhua Shen",Traffic scene perception in computer vision is a critically important task to achieve intelligent cities. To date most existing datasets focus on autonomous driving scenes. We observe that the models trained on those driving datasets often yield unsatisfactory results on traffic monitoring scenes. However little effort has been put into improving the traffic monitoring scene understanding mainly due to the lack of specific datasets. To fill this gap we introduce a specialized traffic monitoring dataset termed TSP6K containing images from the traffic monitoring scenario with high-quality pixel-level and instance-level annotations. The TSP6K dataset captures more crowded traffic scenes with several times more traffic participants than the existing driving scenes. We perform a detailed analysis of the dataset and comprehensively evaluate previous popular scene parsing methods instance segmentation methods and unsupervised domain adaption methods. Furthermore considering the vast difference in instance sizes we propose a detail refining decoder for scene parsing which recovers the details of different semantic regions in traffic scenes owing to the proposed TSP6K dataset. Experiments show its effectiveness in parsing the traffic monitoring scenes.

However the lack of this visual search mechanism in current multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) hinders their ability to focus on important visual details especially when handling high-resolution and visually crowded images. To address this we introduce V* an LLM-guided visual search mechanism that employs the world knowledge in LLMs for efficient visual querying. When combined with an MLLM this mechanism enhances collaborative reasoning contextual understanding and precise visual grounding. This integration results in a new MLLM meta-architecture named Show sEArch and TelL (SEAL). We further create V*Bench a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate MLLMs in their ability to process high-resolution images and focus on visual details.

CVPR-2024-1023,CVPR,2024,Traceable Federated Continual Learning,"Qiang Wang, Bingyan Liu, Yawen Li",Federated continual learning (FCL) is a typical mechanism to achieve collaborative model training among clients that own dynamic data. While traditional FCL methods have been proved effective they do not consider the task repeatability and fail to achieve good performance under this practical scenario. In this paper we propose a new paradigm namely Traceable Federated Continual Learning (TFCL) aiming to cope with repetitive tasks by tracing and augmenting them. Following the new paradigm we develop TagFed a framework that enables accurate and effective Tracing augmentation and Federation for TFCL. The key idea is to decompose the whole model into a series of marked sub-models for optimizing each client task before conducting group-wise knowledge aggregation such that the repetitive tasks can be located precisely and federated selectively for improved performance. Extensive experiments on our constructed benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed framework.

However existing datasets are unable to fulfill the demand for studying minute-level long-term trajectory prediction mainly due to the lack of high-resolution trajectory observation in the wide field of view (FoV). To bridge this gap we introduce a novel dataset named GigaTraj featuring videos capturing a wide FoV with ~ 4 x10^4  m^2 and high-resolution imagery at the gigapixel level. Furthermore GigaTraj includes comprehensive annotations such as bounding boxes identity associations world coordinates group/interaction relationships and scene semantics. Leveraging these multimodal annotations we evaluate and validate the state-of-the-art approaches for minute-level long-term trajectory prediction in large-scale scenes.

Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) is an essential skill in emergency treatment. Currently the assessment of CPR skills mainly depends on dummies and trainers leading to high training costs and low efficiency. For the first time this paper constructs a vision-based system to complete error action recognition and skill assessment in CPR. Specifically we define 13 types of single-error actions and 74 types of composite error actions during external cardiac compression and then develop a video dataset named CPR-Coach. By taking the CPR-Coach as a benchmark this paper investigates and compares the performance of existing action recognition models based on different data modalities. To solve the unavoidable ""Single-class Training & Multi-class Testing"" problem we propose a human-cognition-inspired framework named ImagineNet to improve the model's multi-error recognition performance under restricted supervision.

The way individuals position themselves in relation to others also known as proxemics conveys social cues and affects the dynamics of social interaction. Reconstructing such interaction from images presents challenges because of mutual occlusion and the limited availability of large training datasets. To address this we present a novel approach that learns a prior over the 3D proxemics two people in close social interaction and demonstrate its use for single-view 3D reconstruction. We start by creating 3D training data of interacting people using image datasets with contact annotations. We then model the proxemics using a novel denoising diffusion model called BUDDI that learns the joint distribution over the poses of two people in close social interaction. Sampling from our generative proxemics model produces realistic 3D human interactions which we validate through a perceptual study. We use BUDDI in reconstructing two people in close proximity from an image without any contact annotation via an optimization approach that uses the diffusion model as a prior. Our approach recovers accurate 3D social interactions from noisy initial estimates outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Black",We propose EMAGE a framework to generate full-body human gestures from audio and masked gestures encompassing facial local body hands and global movements. To achieve this we first introduce BEAT2 (BEAT-SMPLX-FLAME) a new mesh-level holistic co-speech dataset. BEAT2 combines a MoShed SMPL-X body with FLAME head parameters and further refines the modeling of head neck and finger movements offering a community-standardized high-quality 3D motion captured dataset. EMAGE leverages masked body gesture priors during training to boost inference performance. It involves a Masked Audio Gesture Transformer facilitating joint training on audio-to-gesture generation and masked gesture reconstruction to effectively encode audio and body gesture hints. Encoded body hints from masked gestures are then separately employed to generate facial and body movements. Moreover EMAGE adaptively merges speech features from the audio's rhythm and content and utilizes four compositional VQ-VAEs to enhance the results' fidelity and diversity.

This interaction field guides the sampling of an object-conditioned human motion diffusion model so as to encourage plausible contacts and affordance semantics. To support interactions with scarcely available data we propose an automated synthetic data pipeline. For this we seed a pre-trained motion model which has priors for the basics of human movement with interaction-specific anchor poses extracted from limited motion capture data.

Black, Justus Thies, Timo Bolkart",We present SCULPT a novel 3D generative model for clothed and textured 3D meshes of humans. Specifically we devise a deep neural network that learns to represent the geometry and appearance distribution of clothed human bodies. Training such a model is challenging as datasets of textured 3D meshes for humans are limited in size and accessibility. Our key observation is that there exist medium-sized 3D scan datasets like CAPE as well as large-scale 2D image datasets of clothed humans and multiple appearances can be mapped to a single geometry. To effectively learn from the two data modalities we propose an unpaired learning procedure for pose-dependent clothed and textured human meshes. Specifically we learn a pose-dependent geometry space from 3D scan data. We represent this as per vertex displacements w.r.t. the SMPL model. Next we train a geometry conditioned texture generator in an unsupervised way using the 2D image data. We use intermediate activations of the learned geometry model to condition our texture generator. To alleviate entanglement between pose and clothing type and pose and clothing appearance we condition both the texture and geometry generators with attribute labels such as clothing types for the geometry and clothing colors for the texture generator. We automatically generated these conditioning labels for the 2D images based on the visual question-answering model BLIP and CLIP. We validate our method on the SCULPT dataset and compare to state-of-the-art 3D generative models for clothed human bodies.

The objective of this task is to learn the co-existing action from limited data and generalize it to unseen humans or even animals. Experimental results show that existing subject-driven customization methods fail to learn the representative characteristics of actions and struggle in decoupling actions from context features including appearance. To overcome the preference for low-level features and the entanglement of high-level features we propose an inversion-based method Action-Disentangled Identifier (ADI) to learn action-specific identifiers from the exemplar images. ADI first expands the semantic conditioning space by introducing layer-wise identifier tokens thereby increasing the representational richness while distributing the inversion across different features. Then to block the inversion of action-agnostic features ADI extracts the gradient invariance from the constructed sample triples and masks the updates of irrelevant channels. To comprehensively evaluate the task we present an ActionBench that includes a variety of actions each accompanied by meticulously selected samples. Both quantitative and qualitative results show that our ADI outperforms existing baselines in action-customized T2I generation.

To account for motion blur in input images we simultaneously capture the camera trajectory and object Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) trajectories within the scene. Additionally we employ a global cross-time rendering approach to ensure consistent temporal coherence across the entire scene. We curate a dataset comprising diverse dynamic scenes that are specifically tailored for our task.

This task is particularly challenging due to heavy occlusion rapid motion and the transitory nature of objects being hand-held where an object may be held released and subsequently picked up again. To tackle these challenges we have developed a novel transformer-based architecture called HOIST-Former. HOIST-Former is adept at spatially and temporally segmenting hands and objects by iteratively pooling features from each other ensuring that the processes of identification segmentation and tracking of hand-held objects depend on the hands' positions and their contextual appearance. We further refine HOIST-Former with a contact loss that focuses on areas where hands are in contact with objects. Moreover we also contribute an in-the-wild video dataset called HOIST which comprises 4125 videos complete with bounding boxes segmentation masks and tracking IDs for hand-held objects.

A common approach enabling the ability to reason over visual data is Scene Graph Generation (SGG); however many existing approaches assume undisturbed vision i.e. the absence of real-world corruptions such as fog snow smoke as well as non-uniform perturbations like sun glare or water drops. In this work we propose a novel SGG benchmark containing procedurally generated weather corruptions and other transformations over the Visual Genome dataset. Further we introduce a corresponding approach Hierarchical Knowledge Enhanced Robust Scene Graph Generation (HiKER-SGG) providing a strong baseline for scene graph generation under such challenging setting. At its core HiKER-SGG utilizes a hierarchical knowledge graph in order to refine its predictions from coarse initial estimates to detailed predictions.

Autofocus control (AC) plays a pivotal role in a camera to efficiently capture information in challenging real-world scenarios. Nevertheless due to disparities in data modality and information characteristics compared to frame stream and event stream the current lack of efficient AC methods has made it challenging for spike cameras to adapt to intricate real-world conditions. To address this challenge we introduce a spike-based autofocus framework that includes a spike-specific focus measure called spike dispersion (SD) which effectively mitigates the influence of variations in scene light intensity during the focusing process by leveraging the spike camera's ability to record full-time spatial light intensity. Additionally the framework integrates a fast search strategy called spike-based golden fast search (SGFS) allowing rapid focal positioning without the need for a complete focus range traversal. To validate the performance of our method we have collected a spike-based autofocus dataset (SAD) containing synthetic data and real-world data under varying scene brightness and motion scenarios. Experimental results on these datasets demonstrate that our method offers state-of-the-art accuracy and efficiency.

Metaxas, Manmohan Chandraker",The perception of 3D motion of surrounding traffic participants is crucial for driving safety. While existing works primarily focus on general large motions we contend that the instantaneous detection and quantification of subtle motions is equally important as they indicate the nuances in driving behavior that may be safety critical such as behaviors near a stop sign of parking positions. We delve into this under-explored task examining its unique challenges and developing our solution accompanied by a carefully designed benchmark. Specifically due to the lack of correspondences between consecutive frames of sparse Lidar point clouds static objects might appear to be moving - the so-called swimming effect. This intertwines with the true object motion thereby posing ambiguity in accurate estimation especially for subtle motion. To address this we propose to leverage local occupancy completion of object point clouds to densify the shape cue and mitigate the impact of swimming artifacts. The occupancy completion is learned in an end-to-end fashion together with the detection of moving objects and the estimation of their motion instantaneously as soon as objects start to move.

Current multi-modal large language models however passively absorb sensory data as inputs lacking the capacity to actively interact with the objects in the 3D environment and dynamically collect their multisensory information. To usher in the study of this area we propose MultiPLY a multisensory embodied large language model that could incorporate multisensory interactive data including visual audio tactile and thermal information into large language models thereby establishing the correlation among words actions and percepts. To this end we first collect Multisensory Universe a large-scale multisensory interaction dataset comprising 500k data by deploying an LLM-powered embodied agent to engage with the 3D environment. To perform instruction tuning with pre-trained LLM on such generated data we first encode the 3D scene as abstracted object-centric representations and then introduce action tokens denoting that the embodied agent takes certain actions within the environment as well as state tokens that represent the multisensory state observations of the agent at each time step. In the inference time MultiPLY could generate action tokens instructing the agent to take the action in the environment and obtain the next multisensory state observation. The observation is then appended back to the LLM via state tokens to generate subsequent text or action tokens. We demonstrate that MultiPLY outperforms baselines by a large margin through a diverse set of embodied tasks involving object retrieval tool use multisensory captioning and task decomposition.,True,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Zhao_Improving_Birds_Eye_View_Semantic_Segmentation_by_Task_Decomposition_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf

Different from the previous evaluation paradigms only in consideration of global attribute variations (e.g. adverse weather) we investigate both local and global attribute variations for robustness evaluation. To achieve this we construct a mask-preserved attribute editing pipeline to edit visual attributes of real images with precise control of structural information. Therefore the original segmentation labels can be reused for the edited images. Using our pipeline we construct a benchmark covering both object and image attributes (e.g. color material pattern style). We evaluate a broad variety of semantic segmentation models spanning from conventional close-set models to recent open-vocabulary large models on their robustness to different types of variations. We find that both local and global attribute variations affect segmentation performances and the sensitivity of models diverges across different variation types. We argue that local attributes have the same importance as global attributes and should be considered in the robustness evaluation of segmentation models.

CVPR-2024-1169,CVPR,2024,ES3: Evolving Self-Supervised Learning of Robust Audio-Visual Speech Representations,"Yuanhang Zhang, Shuang Yang, Shiguang Shan, Xilin Chen","We propose a novel strategy ES3 for self-supervised learning of robust audio-visual speech representations from unlabeled talking face videos. While many recent approaches for this task primarily rely on guiding the learning process using the audio modality alone to capture information shared between audio and video we reframe the problem as the acquisition of shared unique (modality-specific) and synergistic speech information to address the inherent asymmetry between the modalities. Based on this formulation we propose a novel ""evolving"" strategy that progressively builds joint audio-visual speech representations that are strong for both uni-modal (audio & visual) and bi-modal (audio-visual) speech. First we leverage the more easily learnable audio modality to initialize audio and visual representations by capturing audio-unique and shared speech information. Next we incorporate video-unique speech information and bootstrap the audio-visual representations on top of the previously acquired shared knowledge. Finally we maximize the total audio-visual speech information including synergistic information to obtain robust and comprehensive representations. We implement ES3 as a simple Siamese framework and experiments on both English benchmarks and a newly contributed large-scale Mandarin dataset show its effectiveness. In particular on LRS2-BBC our smallest model is on par with SoTA models with only 1/2 parameters and 1/8 unlabeled data (223h).",True,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Mariotti_Improving_Semantic_Correspondence_with_Viewpoint-Guided_Spherical_Maps_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf

Synthetic images such as ImageNet-C ImageNet-9 and Stylized ImageNet provide specific type of evaluation over synthetic corruptions backgrounds and textures yet those robustness benchmarks are restricted in specified variations and have low synthetic quality. In this work we introduce generative model as a data source for synthesizing hard images that benchmark deep models' robustness. Leveraging diffusion models we are able to generate images with more diversified backgrounds textures and materials than any prior work where we term this benchmark as ImageNet-D. Experimental results show that ImageNet-D results in a significant accuracy drop to a range of vision models from the standard ResNet visual classifier to the latest foundation models like CLIP and MiniGPT-4 significantly reducing their accuracy by up to 60%.

To capture the expressive detailed nature of human heads including hair ears and finer-scale eye movements we propose to couple speech signal with the latent space of neural parametric head models to create high-fidelity temporally coherent motion sequences. We propose a new latent diffusion model for this task operating in the expression space of neural parametric head models to synthesize audio-driven realistic head sequences. In the absence of a dataset with corresponding NPHM expressions to audio we optimize for these correspondences to produce a dataset of temporally-optimized NPHM expressions fit to audio-video recordings of people talking. To the best of our knowledge this is the first work to propose a generative approach for realistic and high-quality motion synthesis of volumetric human heads representing a significant advancement in the field of audio-driven 3D animation. Notably our approach stands out in its ability to generate plausible motion sequences that can produce high-fidelity head animation coupled with the NPHM shape space.

However detecting recaptured document images subjected to distortions from online social networks (OSNs) is challenging since the common forensics cues such as moir ?e pattern are weakened during transmission. In this work we first devise a pixel-level distortion model of the screen-recaptured document image to identify the robust features of color artifacts. Then we extract a chromaticity map from the recaptured image to highlight the presence of color artifacts even under low-quality samples. Based on the prior understanding we design a chromaticity map adapter (CMA) to efficiently extract the chromaticity map and feed it into the transformer backbone as multi-modal prompt tokens. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method we collect a recaptured office document image dataset with over 10K diverse samples. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed CMA method outperforms a SOTA approach (with RGB modality only) reducing the average EER from 26.82% to 16.78%. Robustness evaluation shows that our method achieves 0.8688 and 0.7554 AUCs under samples with JPEG compression (QF=70) and resolution as low as 534x503 pixels.,True,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Bu_Instance-level_Expert_Knowledge_and_Aggregate_Discriminative_Attention_for_Radiology_Report_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf

However most of the current methods primarily focus on global or subject-level modifications and often face limitations when it comes to editing specific objects when there are other objects coexisting in the scene given solely textual prompts. In response to this challenge we introduce an object-level generative task called Referring Image Editing (RIE) which enables the identification and editing of specific source objects in an image using text prompts. To tackle this task effectively we propose a tailored framework called ReferDiffusion. It aims to disentangle input prompts into multiple embeddings and employs a mixed-supervised multi-stage training strategy. To facilitate further research in this domain we introduce the RefCOCO-Edit dataset comprising images editing prompts source object segmentation masks and reference edited images for training and evaluation.

Pretrained vision-and-language models have addressed this problem by providing a text description as the answer. However in visual scenes with multiple entities textual descriptions struggle to distinguish the entities from the same category effectively. Consequently the VQA dataset is limited by the limitations of text description and cannot adequately cover scenarios involving multiple entities. To address this challenge we introduce a Mask for Align (Mask4Align) method which can determine the entity's position in the given image that best matches the user-input question. This method incorporates colored masks into the image enabling the VQA model to handle discrimination and localization challenges associated with multiple entities. To process an arbitrary number of similar entities Mask4Align is designed hierarchically to discern subtle differences achieving precise localization. Since Mask4Align directly utilizes pre-trained models it does not introduce additional training overhead. Extensive experiments conducted on both the gaze target prediction task dataset and our proposed multi-entity localization dataset showcase the superiority of Mask4Align.,True,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Wang_Inverse_Rendering_of_Glossy_Objects_via_the_Neural_Plenoptic_Function_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf

We show that DenseAV can discover the ""meaning"" of words and the ""location"" of sounds without explicit localization supervision. Furthermore it automatically discovers and distinguishes between these two types of associations without supervision.

CVPR-2024-1233,CVPR,2024,Revisiting Counterfactual Problems in Referring Expression Comprehension,"Zhihan Yu, Ruifan Li",Traditional referring expression comprehension (REC) aims to locate the target referent in an image guided by a text query. Several previous methods have studied on the Counterfactual problem in REC (C-REC) where the objects for a given query cannot be found in the image. However these methods focus on the overall image-text or specific attribute mismatch only. In this paper we address the C-REC problem from a deep perspective of fine-grained attributes. To this aim we first propose a fine-grained counterfactual sample generation method to construct C-REC datasets. Specifically we leverage pre-trained language model such as BERT to modify the attribute words in the queries obtaining the corresponding counterfactual samples. Furthermore we propose a C-REC framework. We first adopt three encoders to extract image text and attribute features. Then our dual-branch attentive fusion module fuses these cross-modal features with two branches by an attention mechanism. At last two prediction heads generate a bounding box and a counterfactual label respectively. In addition we incorporate contrastive learning with the generated counterfactual samples as negatives to enhance the counterfactual perception.

However understanding fine-grained visual-linguistic concepts such as attributes and inter-object relationships remains a significant challenge. While several benchmarks aim to evaluate VLMs in finer granularity their primary focus remains on the linguistic aspect neglecting the visual dimension. Here we highlight the importance of evaluating VLMs from both a textual and visual perspective. We introduce a progressive pipeline to synthesize images that vary in a specific attribute while ensuring consistency in all other aspects. Utilizing this data engine we carefully design a benchmark SPEC to diagnose the comprehension of object size position existence and count. Subsequently we conduct a thorough evaluation of four leading VLMs on SPEC. Surprisingly their performance is close to random guess revealing significant limitations. With this in mind we propose a simple yet effective approach to optimize VLMs in fine-grained understanding achieving significant improvements on SPEC without compromising the zero-shot performance. Results on two additional fine-grained benchmarks also show consistent improvements further validating the transferability of our approach.

Recently various methods and datasets have showcased the feasibility of dance synthesis. However camera movement synthesis with music and dance remains an unsolved challenging problem due to the scarcity of paired data. Thus we present DCM a new multi-modal 3D dataset which for the first time combines camera movement with dance motion and music audio. This dataset encompasses 108 dance sequences (3.2 hours) of paired dance-camera-music data from the anime community covering 4 music genres. With this dataset we uncover that dance camera movement is multifaceted and human-centric and possesses multiple influencing factors making dance camera synthesis a more challenging task compared to camera or dance synthesis alone. To overcome these difficulties we propose DanceCamera3D a transformer-based diffusion model that incorporates a novel body attention loss and a condition separation strategy.

Subsequent research efforts aim to exploit and apply their capabilities to real image editing. However existing image-to-image methods are often inefficient imprecise and of limited versatility.

Black, Sergi Pujades",The creation of personalized anatomical digital twins is important in the fields of medicine computer graphics sports science and biomechanics. To observe a subject's anatomy expensive medical devices (MRI or CT) are required and the creation of the digital model is often time-consuming and involves manual effort. Instead we leverage the fact that the shape of the body surface is correlated with the internal anatomy; e.g. from surface observations alone one can predict body composition and skeletal structure. In this work we go further and learn to infer the 3D location of three important anatomic tissues: subcutaneous adipose tissue (fat) lean tissue (muscles and organs) and long bones. To learn to infer these tissues we tackle several key challenges. We first create a dataset of human tissues by segmenting full-body MRI scans and registering the SMPL body mesh to the body surface. With this dataset we train HIT (Human Implicit Tissues) an implicit function that given a point inside a body predicts its tissue class. HIT leverages the SMPL body model shape and pose parameters to canonicalize the medical data. Unlike SMPL which is trained from upright 3D scans MRI scans are acquired with subjects lying on a table resulting in significant soft-tissue deformation. Consequently HIT uses a learned volumetric deformation field that undoes these deformations. Since HIT is parameterized by SMPL we can repose bodies or change the shape of subjects and the internal structures deform appropriately. We perform extensive experiments to validate HIT's ability to predict a plausible internal structure for novel subjects.

Most previous methods rely on the low-light enhancement of a conventional RGB camera. However they would inevitably face a dilemma between the long exposure time of nighttime and the motion blur of dynamic scenes. Event cameras react to dynamic changes with higher temporal resolution (microsecond) and higher dynamic range (120dB) offering an alternative solution. In this work we present a novel nighttime dynamic imaging method with an event camera. Specifically we discover that the event at nighttime exhibits temporal trailing characteristics and spatial non-stationary distribution. Consequently we propose a nighttime event reconstruction network (NER-Net) which mainly includes a learnable event timestamps calibration module (LETC) to align the temporal trailing events and a non-uniform illumination aware module (NIAM) to stabilize the spatiotemporal distribution of events. Moreover we construct a paired real low-light event dataset (RLED) through a co-axial imaging system including 64200 spatially and temporally aligned image GTs and low-light events.

On the other hand sparse image inputs as a practical capture setting commonly cause incomplete or distorted results due to the lack of correspondence matching. This paper jointly handles the challenges from sparse inputs and reflective surfaces by leveraging polarized images. We derive photometric and geometric cues from the polarimetric image formation model and multiview azimuth consistency which jointly optimize the surface geometry modeled via implicit neural representation. Based on the experiments on our synthetic and real datasets we achieve the state-of-the-art surface reconstruction results with only 6 views as input.,True,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/He_Latent_Modulated_Function_for_Computational_Optimal_Continuous_Image_Representation_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf

Narasimhan",Current methods for 2D and 3D object understanding struggle with severe occlusions in busy urban environments partly due to the lack of large-scale labeled ground-truth annotations for learning occlusion. In this work we introduce a novel framework for automatically generating a large realistic dataset of dynamic objects under occlusions using freely available time-lapse imagery. By leveraging off-the-shelf 2D (bounding box segmentation keypoint) and 3D (pose shape) predictions as pseudo-groundtruth unoccluded 3D objects are identified automatically and composited into the background in a clip-art style ensuring realistic appearances and physically accurate occlusion configurations. The resulting clip-art image with pseudo-groundtruth enables efficient training of object reconstruction methods that are robust to occlusions. Our method demonstrates significant improvements in both 2D and 3D reconstruction particularly in scenarios with heavily occluded objects like vehicles and people in urban scenes.,True,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Liu_Learn_from_View_Correlation_An_Anchor_Enhancement_Strategy_for_Multi-view_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf

Our work addresses this by identifying a broad spectrum of contrast misalignments such as replacing entities actions and flipping event order which alignment models should be robust against. To this end we introduce the VideoCon a video-language alignment dataset constructed by a large language model that generates plausible contrast video captions and explanations for differences between original and contrast video captions. Then a generative video-language model is finetuned with VideoCon to assess video-language entailment and generate explanations. Our VideoCon-based alignment model significantly outperforms current models. It exhibits a 12-point increase in AUC for the video-language alignment task on human-generated contrast captions. Finally our model sets new state of the art zero-shot performance in temporally-extensive video-language tasks such as text-to-video retrieval (SSv2-Temporal) and video question answering (ATP-Hard).

Mitra, Changjian Li",CAD programs are a popular way to compactly encode shapes as a sequence of operations that are easy to parametrically modify. However without sufficient semantic comments and structure such programs can be challenging to understand let alone modify. We introduce the problem of semantic commenting CAD programs wherein the goal is to segment the input program into code blocks corresponding to semantically meaningful shape parts and assign a semantic label to each block. We solve the problem by combining program parsing with visual-semantic analysis afforded by recent advances in foundational language and vision models. Specifically by executing the input programs we create shapes which we use to generate conditional photorealistic images to make use of semantic annotators for such images. We then distill the information across the images and link back to the original programs to semantically comment on them. Additionally we collected and annotated a benchmark dataset CADTalk consisting of 5288 machine-made programs and 45 human-made programs with ground truth semantic comments. We extensively evaluated our approach compared it to a GPT-based baseline and an open-set shape segmentation baseline and reported an 83.24% accuracy on the new CADTalk dataset.

However existing approaches reliant on spike cameras often assume optimal illumination a condition frequently unmet in real-world scenarios. To address this we introduce SpikeNeRF the first work that derives a NeRF-based volumetric scene representation from spike camera data. Our approach leverages NeRF's multi-view consistency to establish robust self-supervision effectively eliminating erroneous measurements and uncovering coherent structures within exceedingly noisy input amidst diverse real-world illumination scenarios. The framework comprises two core elements: a spike generation model incorporating an integrate-and-fire neuron layer and parameters accounting for non-idealities such as threshold variation and a spike rendering loss capable of generalizing across varying illumination conditions. We describe how to effectively optimize neural radiance fields to render photorealistic novel views from the novel continuous spike stream demonstrating advantages over other vision sensors in certain scenes.

Although recent work attempts to learn these preferences via human annotated images they reduce the rich tapestry of human preference to a single overall score. However the preference results vary when humans evaluate images with different aspects. Therefore to learn the multi-dimensional human preferences we propose the Multi-dimensional Preference Score (MPS) the first multi-dimensional preference scoring model for the evaluation of text-to-image models. The MPS introduces the preference condition module upon CLIP model to learn these diverse preferences. It is trained based on our Multi-dimensional Human Preference (MHP) Dataset which comprises 918315 human preference choices across four dimensions (i.e. aesthetics semantic alignment detail quality and overall assessment) on 607541 images. The images are generated by a wide range of latest text-to-image models.

To achieve the personalization capability existing methods rely on finetuning a text-to-image foundation model on a user's custom dataset which can be non-trivial for general users resource-intensive and time-consuming. Despite attempts to develope finetuning-free methods their generation quality is much lower compared to their finetuning counterparts. In this paper we propose Joint-Image Diffusion (\\\\jedi) an effective technique for learning a finetuning-free personalization model. Our key idea is to learn the joint distribution of multiple related text-image pairs that share a common subject. To facilitate learning we propose a scalable synthetic dataset generation technique. Once trained our model enables fast and easy personalization at test time by simply using reference images as input during the sampling process. Our approach does not require any expensive optimization process or additional modules and can faithfully preserve the identity represented by any number of reference images.

However this task presents significant challenges due to the inherent ambiguity of the captured measurements and lacks effective methods for directly estimating human pose and shape from lensless data. In this paper we propose the first end-to-end framework to recover 3D human poses and shapes from lensless measurements to our knowledge. We specifically design a multi-scale lensless feature decoder to decode the lensless measurements through the optically encoded mask for efficient feature extraction.

O. Cruz, Marc-André Carbonneau",Reconstructing an avatar from a portrait image has many applications in multimedia but remains a challenging research problem. Extracting reflectance maps and geometry from one image is ill-posed: recovering geometry is a one-to-many mapping problem and reflectance and light are difficult to disentangle. Accurate geometry and reflectance can be captured under the controlled conditions of a light stage but it is costly to acquire large datasets in this fashion. Moreover training solely with this type of data leads to poor generalization with in-the-wild images. This motivates the introduction of MoSAR a method for 3D avatar generation from monocular images. We propose a semi-supervised training scheme that improves generalization by learning from both light stage and in-the-wild datasets. This is achieved using a novel differentiable shading formulation. We show that our approach effectively disentangles the intrinsic face parameters producing relightable avatars. As a result MoSAR estimates a richer set of skin reflectance maps and generates more realistic avatars than existing state-of-the-art methods.

Yet existing methods are largely limited to generating body motions only without considering the rich two-hand motions let alone handling various conditions like body dynamics or texts. To break the data bottleneck we propose BOTH57M a novel multi-modal dataset for two-hand motion generation. Our dataset includes accurate motion tracking for the human body and hands and provides pair-wised finger-level hand annotations and body descriptions. We further provide a strong baseline method BOTH2Hands for the novel task: generating vivid two-hand motions from both implicit body dynamics and explicit text prompts. We first warm up two parallel body-to-hand and text-to-hand diffusion models and then utilize the cross-attention transformer for motion blending.

Existing datasets tend to annotate dense foot contact using visual matching with thresholding or incorporating pressure signals. However these approaches either suffer from low accuracy or are only designed for small-range and slow motion. There is still a lack of a vision-pressure multimodal dataset with large-range and fast human motion as well as accurate and dense foot-contact annotation. To fill this gap we propose a Multimodal MoCap Dataset with Vision and Pressure sensors named MMVP. MMVP provides accurate and dense plantar pressure signals synchronized with RGBD observations which is especially useful for both plausible shape estimation robust pose fitting without foot drifting and accurate global translation tracking. To validate the dataset we propose an RGBD-P SMPL fitting method and also a monocular-video-based baseline framework VP-MoCap for human motion capture. Experiments demonstrate that our RGBD-P SMPL Fitting results significantly outperform pure visual motion capture. Moreover VP-MoCap outperforms SOTA methods in foot-contact and global translation estimation accuracy.

C3Net adapts the ControlNet architecture to jointly train and make inferences on a production-ready diffusion model and its trainable copies. Specifically C3Net first aligns the conditions from multi-modalities to the same semantic latent space using modality-specific encoders based on contrastive training. Then it generates multimodal outputs based on the aligned latent space whose semantic information is combined using a ControlNet-like architecture called Control C3-UNet. Correspondingly with this system design our model offers an improved solution for joint-modality generation through learning and explaining multimodal conditions involving more than just linear interpolation within the latent space. Meanwhile as we align conditions to a unified latent space C3Net only requires one trainable Control C3-UNet to work on multimodal semantic information. Furthermore our model employs unimodal pretraining on the condition alignment stage outperforming the non-pretrained alignment even on relatively scarce training data and thus demonstrating high-quality compound condition generation.

To address these challenges we introduce the Rotated Multi-Scale Interaction Network (RMSIN) an innovative approach designed for the unique demands of RRSIS. RMSIN incorporates an Intra-scale Interaction Module (IIM) to effectively address the fine-grained detail required at multiple scales and a Cross-scale Interaction Module (CIM) for integrating these details coherently across the network. Furthermore RMSIN employs an Adaptive Rotated Convolution (ARC) to account for the diverse orientations of objects a novel contribution that significantly enhances segmentation accuracy. To assess the efficacy of RMSIN we have curated an expansive dataset comprising 17402 image-caption-mask triplets which is unparalleled in terms of scale and variety. This dataset not only presents the model with a wide range of spatial and rotational scenarios but also establishes a stringent benchmark for the RRSIS task ensuring a rigorous evaluation of performance. Experimental evaluations demonstrate the exceptional performance of RMSIN surpassing existing state-of-the-art models by a significant margin.

Our method capitalizes on the generative prior of text-to-image models known for photorealism employing a scalar value and instructions to alter low-level material properties. Addressing the lack of datasets with controlled material attributes we generated an object-centric synthetic dataset with physically-based materials. Fine-tuning a modified pre-trained text-to-image model on this synthetic dataset enables us to edit material properties in real-world images while preserving all other attributes.

CVPR-2024-1461,CVPR,2024,The Audio-Visual Conversational Graph: From an Egocentric-Exocentric Perspective,"Wenqi Jia, Miao Liu, Hao Jiang, Ishwarya Ananthabhotla, James M. Rehg, Vamsi Krishna Ithapu, Ruohan Gao",In recent years the thriving development of research related to egocentric videos has provided a unique perspective for the study of conversational interactions where both visual and audio signals play a crucial role. While most prior work focus on learning about behaviors that directly involve the camera wearer we introduce the Ego-Exocentric Conversational Graph Prediction problem marking the first attempt to infer exocentric conversational interactions from egocentric videos. We propose a unified multi-modal framework---Audio-Visual Conversational Attention (AV-CONV) for the joint prediction of conversation behaviors---speaking and listening---for both the camera wearer as well as all other social partners present in the egocentric video. Specifically we adopt the self-attention mechanism to model the representations across-time across-subjects and across-modalities. To validate our method we conduct experiments on a challenging egocentric video dataset that includes multi-speaker and multi-conversation scenarios. Our results demonstrate the superior performance of our method compared to a series of baselines. We also present detailed ablation studies to assess the contribution of each component in our model.

Sohn, Sejong Yoon, Vladimir Pavlovic, Mubbasir Kapadia",The study of complex human interactions and group activities has become a focal point in human-centric computer vision. However progress in related tasks is often hindered by the challenges of obtaining large-scale labeled datasets from real-world scenarios. To address the limitation we introduce M3Act a synthetic data generator for multi-view multi-group multi-person human atomic actions and group activities. Powered by Unity Engine M3Act features multiple semantic groups highly diverse and photorealistic images and a comprehensive set of annotations which facilitates the learning of human-centered tasks across single-person multi-person and multi-group conditions. We demonstrate the advantages of M3Act across three core experiments. The results suggest our synthetic dataset can significantly improve the performance of several downstream methods and replace real-world datasets to reduce cost. Notably M3Act improves the state-of-the-art MOTRv2 on DanceTrack dataset leading to a hop on the leaderboard from 10th to 2nd place. Moreover M3Act opens new research for controllable 3D group activity generation. We define multiple metrics and propose a competitive baseline for the novel task.

It seeks to distinguish the worked material which is critical for understanding archaeological artifacts material interactions tool functionalities and dental records. However this challenging task goes beyond the well-studied image classification problem for common objects. It is affected by many confounders owing to the complex wear mechanism and microscopic imaging which makes it difficult even for human experts to identify the worked material successfully. In this paper we investigate the following three questions on this unique vision task for the first time:(i) How well can state-of-the-art pre-trained models (like DINOv2) generalize to the rarely seen domain? (ii) How can few-shot learning be exploited for scarce microscopic images? (iii) How do the ambiguous magnification and sensing modality influence the classification accuracy? To study these we collaborated with archaeologists and built the first open-source and the largest LUWA dataset containing 23130 microscopic images with different magnifications and sensing modalities. Extensive experiments show that existing pre-trained models notably outperform human experts but still leave a large gap for improvements. Most importantly the LUWA dataset provides an underexplored opportunity for vision and learning communities and complements existing image classification problems on common objects.,True,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Xu_MPOD123_One_Image_to_3D_Content_Generation_Using_Mask-enhanced_Progressive_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf

Forsyth, Anand Bhattad",Generative models can produce impressively realistic images. This paper demonstrates that generated images have geometric features different from those of real images. We build a set of collections of generated images prequalified to fool simple signal-based classifiers into believing they are real. We then show that prequalified generated images can be identified reliably by classifiers that only look at geometric properties. We use three such classifiers. All three classifiers are denied access to image pixels and look only at derived geometric features. The first classifier looks at the perspective field of the image the second looks at lines detected in the image and the third looks at relations between detected objects and shadows. Our procedure detects generated images more reliably than SOTA local signal based detectors for images from a number of distinct generators. Saliency maps suggest that the classifiers can identify geometric problems reliably. We conclude that current generators cannot reliably reproduce geometric properties of real images.,True,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Jin_MV-Adapter_Multimodal_Video_Transfer_Learning_for_Video_Text_Retrieval_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf

This task has practical applications in various fields such as visual surveillance crowd behavior analysis and anomaly detection. However due to the difficulty and cost of collecting and labeling data existing datasets for this task are either synthetically generated or artificially constructed within a controlled camera network setting which limits their ability to model real-world dynamics and generalize to diverse camera configurations. To address this issue we present MTMMC a real-world large-scale dataset that includes long video sequences captured by 16 multi-modal cameras in two different environments - campus and factory - across various time weather and season conditions. This dataset provides a challenging test bed for studying multi-camera tracking under diverse real-world complexities and includes an additional input modality of spatially aligned and temporally synchronized RGB and thermal cameras which enhances the accuracy of multi-camera tracking. MTMMC is a super-set of existing datasets benefiting independent fields such as person detection re-identification and multiple object tracking.

Personalized Text-to-Image Retrieval (TIR) or Generation (TIG) are recently introduced tasks that represent this challenge where the VL model has to learn a concept from few images and respectively discriminate or generate images of the target concept in arbitrary contexts. We identify the ability to learn new meanings and their compositionality with known ones as two key properties of a personalized system. We show that the available benchmarks offer a limited validation of personalized textual concept learning from images with respect to the above properties and introduce ConCon-Chi as a benchmark for both personalized TIR and TIG designed to fill this gap. We modelled the new-meaning concepts by crafting chimeric objects and formulating a large varied set of contexts where we photographed each object. To promote the compositionality assessment of the learned concepts with known contexts we combined different contexts with the same concept and vice-versa. We carry out a thorough evaluation of state-of-the-art methods on the resulting dataset. Our study suggests that future work on personalized TIR and TIG methods should focus on the above key properties and we propose principles and a dataset for their performance assessment.

EASGs extend standard manually-annotated representations of egocentric videos such as verb-noun action labels by providing a temporally evolving graph-based description of the actions performed by the camera wearer including interacted objects their relationships and how actions unfold in time. Through a novel annotation procedure we extend the Ego4D dataset adding manually labeled Egocentric Action Scene Graphs which offer a rich set of annotations for long-from egocentric video understanding. We hence define the EASG generation task and provide a baseline approach establishing preliminary benchmarks. Experiments on two downstream tasks action anticipation and activity summarization highlight the effectiveness of EASGs for long-form egocentric video understanding.

We believe that - to effectively transfer such an holistic perception to intelligent machines - an important role is played by learning to correlate concepts and to abstract knowledge coming from different tasks to synergistically exploit them when learning novel skills. To accomplish this we look for a unified approach to video understanding which combines shared temporal modelling of human actions with minimal overhead to support multiple downstream tasks and enable cooperation when learning novel skills. We then propose EgoPack a solution that creates a collection of task perspectives that can be carried across downstream tasks and used as a potential source of additional insights as a backpack of skills that a robot can carry around and use when needed. We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach on four Ego4D benchmarks outperforming current state-of-the-art methods.

To start we generate a large-scale High-Resolution Event Meshflow (HREM) dataset which showcases its superiority by encompassing the merits of high resolution at 1280x720 handling dynamic objects and complex motion patterns and offering both optical flow and meshflow labels. These aspects have not been fully explored in previous works. Besides we propose Efficient Event-based MeshFlow (EEMFlow) network a lightweight model featuring a specially crafted encoder-decoder architecture to facilitate swift and accurate meshflow estimation. Furthermore we upgrade EEMFlow network to support dense event optical flow in which a Confidence-induced Detail Completion (CDC) module is proposed to preserve sharp motion boundaries.

CVPR-2024-1518,CVPR,2024,Generating Handwritten Mathematical Expressions From Symbol Graphs: An End-to-End Pipeline,"Yu Chen, Fei Gao, Yanguang Zhang, Maoying Qiao, Nannan Wang",In this paper we explore a novel challenging generation task i.e. Handwritten Mathematical Expression Generation (HMEG) from symbolic sequences. Since symbolic sequences are naturally graph-structured data we formulate HMEG as a graph-to-image (G2I) generation problem. Unlike the generation of natural images HMEG requires critic layout clarity for synthesizing correct and recognizable formulas but has no real masks available to supervise the learning process. To alleviate this challenge we propose a novel end-to-end G2I generation pipeline (i.e. graph - layout - mask - image) which requires no real masks or nondifferentiable alignment between layouts and masks. Technically to boost the capacity of predicting detailed relations among adjacent symbols we propose a Less-is-More (LiM) learning strategy. In addition we design a differentiable layout refinement module which maps bounding boxes to pixel-level soft masks so as to further alleviate ambiguous layout areas. Our whole model including layout prediction mask refinement and image generation can be jointly optimized in an end-to-end manner. Experimental results show that our model can generate high-quality HME images and outperforms previous generative methods. Besides a series of ablations study demonstrate effectiveness of the proposed techniques. Finally we validate that our generated images promisingly boosts the performance of HME recognition models through data augmentation.

However the current computer vision community studies specific person re-identification (ReID) tasks in different scenarios separately which limits the applications in the real world. This paper strives to resolve this problem by proposing a new instruct-ReID task that requires the model to retrieve images according to the given image or language instructions. Our instruct-ReID is a more general ReID setting where existing 6 ReID tasks can be viewed as special cases by designing different instructions. We propose a large-scale OmniReID benchmark and an adaptive triplet loss as a baseline method to facilitate research in this new setting.

Our method defines the transformation as a 3D flowspecifically as a weighted linear blending of rigid transformations of 3D anchor points that are defined on the surface of the scene. In order to identify anchor points we introduce a novel correspondence algorithm that first matches RGB-based pairs then leverages multi-view information and 3D reprojection to robustly filter false positives in two steps. We also introduce a new dataset for exploring the problem of modifying a NeRF scene through a single observation.

Prior studies have primarily focused on probing such bias attributes individually while ignoring biases associated with intersections between social attributes. This could be due to the difficulty of collecting an exhaustive set of image-text pairs for various combinations of social attributes. To address this challenge we employ text-to-image diffusion models to produce counterfactual examples for probing intersectional social biases at scale. Our approach utilizes Stable Diffusion with cross attention control to produce sets of counterfactual image-text pairs that are highly similar in their depiction of a subject (e.g. a given occupation) while differing only in their depiction of intersectional social attributes (e.g. race & gender). Through our over-generate-then-filter methodology we produce SocialCounterfactuals a high-quality dataset containing 171k image-text pairs for probing intersectional biases related to gender race and physical characteristics.

Visually Grounded Video Question Answering,"Junbin Xiao, Angela Yao, Yicong Li, Tat-Seng Chua",We study visually grounded VideoQA in response to the emerging trends of utilizing pretraining techniques for video- language understanding. Specifically by forcing vision- language models (VLMs) to answer questions and simultane- ously provide visual evidence we seek to ascertain the extent to which the predictions of such techniques are genuinely anchored in relevant video content versus spurious corre- lations from language or irrelevant visual context. Towards this we construct NExT-GQA - an extension of NExT-QA with 10.5K temporal grounding (or location) labels tied to the original QA pairs. With NExT-GQA we scrutinize a series of state-of-the-art VLMs. Through post-hoc atten- tion analysis we find that these models are extremely weak in substantiating the answers despite their strong QA per- formance. This exposes the limitation of current VLMs in making reliable predictions. As a remedy we further explore and propose a grounded-QA method via Gaussian mask optimization and cross-modal learning. Experiments with different backbones demonstrate that this grounding mechanism improves both grounding and QA. With these efforts we aim to push towards trustworthy VLMs in VQA systems.

Recent data-driven metrics have demonstrated a stronger correlation with human judgments than classic metrics such as CIDEr; however they lack sufficient capabilities to handle hallucinations and generalize across diverse images and texts partially because they compute scalar similarities merely using embeddings learned from tasks unrelated to image captioning evaluation. In this study we propose Polos a supervised automatic evaluation metric for image captioning models. Polos computes scores from multimodal inputs using a parallel feature extraction mechanism that leverages embeddings trained through large-scale contrastive learning. To train Polos we introduce Multimodal Metric Learning from Human Feedback (M2LHF) a framework for developing metrics based on human feedback. We constructed the Polaris dataset which comprises 131K human judgments from 550 evaluators which is approximately ten times larger than standard datasets.

Rehg",Understanding social interactions involving both verbal and non-verbal cues is essential for effectively interpreting social situations. However most prior works on multimodal social cues focus predominantly on single-person behaviors or rely on holistic visual representations that are not aligned to utterances in multi-party environments. Consequently they are limited in modeling the intricate dynamics of multi-party interactions. In this paper we introduce three new challenging tasks to model the fine-grained dynamics between multiple people: speaking target identification pronoun coreference resolution and mentioned player prediction. We contribute extensive data annotations to curate these new challenges in social deduction game settings. Furthermore we propose a novel multimodal baseline that leverages densely aligned language-visual representations by synchronizing visual features with their corresponding utterances. This facilitates concurrently capturing verbal and non-verbal cues pertinent to social reasoning.

CVPR-2024-1587,CVPR,2024,The STVchrono Dataset: Towards Continuous Change Recognition in Time,"Yanjun Sun, Yue Qiu, Mariia Khan, Fumiya Matsuzawa, Kenji Iwata",Recognizing continuous changes offers valuable insights into past historical events supports current trend analysis and facilitates future planning. This knowledge is crucial for a variety of fields such as meteorology and agriculture environmental science urban planning and construction tourism and cultural preservation. Currently available datasets in the field of scene change understanding primarily concentrate on two main tasks: the detection of changed regions within a scene and the linguistic description of the change content. Existing datasets focus on recognizing discrete changes such as adding or deleting an object from two images and largely rely on artificially generated images. Consequently the existing change understanding methods primarily focus on identifying distinct object differences overlooking the importance of continuous gradual changes occurring over extended time intervals. To address the above issues we propose a novel benchmark dataset STVchrono targeting the localization and description of long-term continuous changes in real-world scenes. The dataset consists of 71900 photographs from Google Street View API taken over an 18-year span across 50 cities all over the world. Our STVchrono dataset is designed to support real-world continuous change recognition and description in both image pairs and extended image sequences while also enabling the segmentation of changed regions. We conduct experiments to evaluate state-of-the-art methods on continuous change description and segmentation as well as multimodal Large Language Models for describing changes. Our findings reveal that even the most advanced methods lag human performance emphasizing the need to adapt them to continuously changing real-world scenarios.

Rehg",We study the problem of single-image zero-shot 3D shape reconstruction. Recent works learn zero-shot shape reconstruction through generative modeling of 3D assets but these models are computationally expensive at train and inference time. In contrast the traditional approach to this problem is regression-based where deterministic models are trained to directly regress the object shape. Such regression methods possess much higher computational efficiency than generative methods. This raises a natural question: is generative modeling necessary for high performance or conversely are regression-based approaches still competitive? To answer this we design a strong regression-based model called ZeroShape based on the converging findings in this field and a novel insight. We also curate a large real-world evaluation benchmark with objects from three different real-world 3D datasets. This evaluation benchmark is more diverse and an order of magnitude larger than what prior works use to quantitatively evaluate their models aiming at reducing the evaluation variance in our field. We show that ZeroShape not only achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art methods but also demonstrates significantly higher computational and data efficiency.,True,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Wang_Move_as_You_Say_Interact_as_You_Can_Language-guided_Human_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
CVPR-2024-1589,CVPR,2024,RLHF-V: Towards Trustworthy MLLMs via Behavior Alignment from Fine-grained Correctional Human Feedback,"Tianyu Yu, Yuan Yao, Haoye Zhang, Taiwen He, Yifeng Han, Ganqu Cui, Jinyi Hu, Zhiyuan Liu, Hai-Tao Zheng, Maosong Sun, Tat-Seng Chua",Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have recently demonstrated impressive capabilities in multimodal understanding reasoning and interaction. However existing MLLMs prevalently suffer from serious hallucination problems generating text that is not factually grounded in associated images. The problem makes existing MLLMs untrustworthy and thus impractical in real-world (especially high-stakes) applications. To address the challenge we present RLHF-V which enhances MLLM trustworthiness via behavior alignment from fine-grained correctional human feedback. Specifically RLHF-V collects human preference in the form of segment-level corrections on hallucinations and performs dense direct preference optimization over the human feedback. Comprehensive experiments on five benchmarks in both automatic and human evaluation show that RLHF-V can enable substantially more trustworthy MLLM behaviors with promising data and computation efficiency. Remarkably using 1.4k annotated data samples RLHF-V significantly reduces the hallucination rate of the base MLLM by 34.8% outperforming the concurrent LLaVA-RLHF trained on 10k annotated data.

CVPR-2024-1592,CVPR,2024,FineParser: A Fine-grained Spatio-temporal Action Parser for Human-centric Action Quality Assessment,"Jinglin Xu, Sibo Yin, Guohao Zhao, Zishuo Wang, Yuxin Peng",Existing action quality assessment (AQA) methods mainly learn deep representations at the video level for scoring diverse actions. Due to the lack of a fine-grained understanding of actions in videos they harshly suffer from low credibility and interpretability thus insufficient for stringent applications such as Olympic diving events. We argue that a fine-grained understanding of actions requires the model to perceive and parse actions in both time and space which is also the key to the credibility and interpretability of the AQA technique. Based on this insight we propose a new fine-grained spatial-temporal action parser named FineParser. It learns human-centric foreground action representations by focusing on target action regions within each frame and exploiting their fine-grained alignments in time and space to minimize the impact of invalid backgrounds during the assessment. In addition we construct fine-grained annotations of human-centric foreground action masks for the FineDiving dataset called FineDiving-HM. With refined annotations on diverse target action procedures FineDiving-HM can promote the development of real-world AQA systems. Through extensive experiments we demonstrate the effectiveness of FineParser which outperforms state-of-the-art methods while supporting more tasks of fine-grained action understanding.

CVPR-2024-1594,CVPR,2024,PairAug: What Can Augmented Image-Text Pairs Do for Radiology?,"Yutong Xie, Qi Chen, Sinuo Wang, Minh-Son To, Iris Lee, Ee Win Khoo, Kerolos Hendy, Daniel Koh, Yong Xia, Qi Wu",Current vision-language pre-training (VLP) methodologies predominantly depend on paired image-text datasets a resource that is challenging to acquire in radiology due to privacy considerations and labelling complexities. Data augmentation provides a practical solution to overcome the issue of data scarcity however most augmentation methods exhibit a limited focus prioritising either image or text augmentation exclusively. Acknowledging this limitation our objective is to devise a framework capable of concurrently augmenting medical image and text data. We design a Pairwise Augmentation (PairAug) approach that contains an Inter-patient Augmentation (InterAug) branch and an Intra-patient Augmentation (IntraAug) branch. Specifically the InterAug branch of our approach generates radiology images using synthesised yet plausible reports derived from a Large Language Model (LLM). The generated pairs can be considered a collection of new patient cases since they are artificially created and may not exist in the original dataset. In contrast the IntraAug branch uses newly generated reports to manipulate images. This process allows us to create new paired data for each individual with diverse medical conditions. Our extensive experiments on various downstream tasks covering medical image classification zero-shot and fine-tuning analysis demonstrate that our PairAug concurrently expanding both image and text data substantially outperforms image-/text-only expansion baselines and advanced medical VLP baselines.

CVPR-2024-1598,CVPR,2024,SUGAR: Pre-training 3D Visual Representations for Robotics,"Shizhe Chen, Ricardo Garcia, Ivan Laptev, Cordelia Schmid",Learning generalizable visual representations from Internet data has yielded promising results for robotics. Yet prevailing approaches focus on pre-training 2D representations being sub-optimal to deal with occlusions and accurately localize objects in complex 3D scenes. Meanwhile 3D representation learning has been limited to single-object understanding. To address these limitations we introduce a novel 3D pre-training framework for robotics named SUGAR that captures semantic geometric and affordance properties of objects through 3D point clouds. We underscore the importance of cluttered scenes in 3D representation learning and automatically construct a multi-object dataset benefiting from cost-free supervision in simulation. SUGAR employs a versatile transformer-based model to jointly address five pre-training tasks namely cross-modal knowledge distillation for semantic learning masked point modeling to understand geometry structures grasping pose synthesis for object affordance 3D instance segmentation and referring expression grounding to analyze cluttered scenes. We evaluate our learned representation on three robotic-related tasks namely zero-shot 3D object recognition referring expression grounding and language-driven robotic manipulation. Experimental results show that SUGAR's 3D representation outperforms state-of-the-art 2D and 3D representations.,True,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Yan_Multi-Scale_3D_Gaussian_Splatting_for_Anti-Aliased_Rendering_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
CVPR-2024-1600,CVPR,2024,FocusMAE: Gallbladder Cancer Detection from Ultrasound Videos with Focused Masked Autoencoders,"Soumen Basu, Mayuna Gupta, Chetan Madan, Pankaj Gupta, Chetan Arora",In recent years automated Gallbladder Cancer (GBC) detection has gained the attention of researchers. Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methodologies relying on ultrasound sonography (US) images exhibit limited generalization emphasizing the need for transformative approaches. We observe that individual US frames may lack sufficient information to capture disease manifestation. This study advocates for a paradigm shift towards video-based GBC detection leveraging the inherent advantages of spatiotemporal representations. Employing the Masked Autoencoder (MAE) for representation learning we address shortcomings in conventional image-based methods. We propose a novel design called FocusMAE to systematically bias the selection of masking tokens from high-information regions fostering a more refined representation of malignancy. Additionally we contribute the most extensive US video dataset for GBC detection. We also note that this is the first study on US video-based GBC detection. We validate the proposed methods on the curated dataset and report a new SOTA accuracy of 96.4% for the GBC detection problem against an accuracy of 84% by current Image-based SOTA - GBCNet and RadFormer and 94.7% by Video-based SOTA - AdaMAE. We further demonstrate the generality of the proposed FocusMAE on a public CT-based Covid detection dataset reporting an improvement in accuracy by 3.3% over current baselines.

Yao, Belinda Zeng, Mubarak Shah, Trishul Chilimbi",In this paper we propose VidLA an approach for video-language alignment at scale. There are two major limitations of previous video-language alignment approaches. First they do not capture both short-range and long-range temporal dependencies and typically employ complex hierarchical deep network architectures that are hard to integrate with existing pretrained image-text foundation models. To effectively address this limitation we instead keep the network architecture simple and use a set of data tokens that operate at different temporal resolutions in a hierarchical manner accounting for the temporally hierarchical nature of videos. By employing a simple two-tower architecture we are able to initialize our video-language model with pretrained image-text foundation models thereby boosting the final performance. Second existing video-language alignment works struggle due to the lack of semantically aligned large-scale training data. To overcome it we leverage recent LLMs to curate the largest video-language dataset to date with better visual grounding. Furthermore unlike existing video-text datasets which only contain short clips our dataset is enriched with video clips of varying durations to aid our temporally hierarchical data tokens in extracting better representations at varying temporal scales. Overall empirical results show that our proposed approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods on multiple retrieval benchmarks especially on longer videos and performs competitively on classification benchmarks.,True,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Lee_Multi-criteria_Token_Fusion_with_One-step-ahead_Attention_for_Efficient_Vision_Transformers_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
CVPR-2024-1608,CVPR,2024,Quilt-LLaVA: Visual Instruction Tuning by Extracting Localized Narratives from Open-Source Histopathology Videos,"Mehmet Saygin Seyfioglu, Wisdom O. Ikezogwo, Fatemeh Ghezloo, Ranjay Krishna, Linda Shapiro",Diagnosis in histopathology requires a global whole slide images (WSIs) analysis requiring pathologists to compound evidence from different WSI patches. The gigapixel scale of WSIs poses a challenge for histopathology multi-modal models. Training multi-model models for histopathology requires instruction tuning datasets which currently contain information for individual image patches without a spatial grounding of the concepts within each patch and without a wider view of the WSI. To bridge this gap we introduce QUILT-INSTRUCT a large-scale dataset of 107131 histopathology-specific instruction question/answer pairs grounded within diagnostically relevant image patches that make up the WSI. Our dataset is collected by leveraging educational histopathology videos from YouTube which provides spatial localization of narrations by automatically extracting the narrators' cursor positions. QUILT-INSTRUCT supports contextual reasoning by extracting diagnosis and supporting facts from the entire WSI. Using QUILT-INSTRUCT we train QUILT-LLAVA which can reason beyond the given single image patch enabling diagnostic reasoning across patches. To evaluate QUILT-LLAVA we propose a comprehensive evaluation dataset created from 985 images and 1283 human-generated question-answers. We also thoroughly evaluate QUILT-LLAVA using public histopathology datasets where QUILT-LLAVA significantly outperforms SOTA by over 10% on relative GPT-4 score and 4% and 9% on open and closed set VQA.,True,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/He_Multi-modal_Instruction_Tuned_LLMs_with_Fine-grained_Visual_Perception_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf

Additionally we construct an instruction-tuning dataset encompassing 6 tasks and a total of 125K instances to further enhance TimeChat's instruction-following performance. Experiment results across various video understanding tasks such as dense captioning temporal grounding and highlight detection demonstrate TimeChat's strong zero-shot temporal localization and reasoning capabilities.

However existing methods are still inadequate to meet the needs of practical application suffering from the following limitations: 1) explainability is not ensured which is essential in real teaching scenarios; 2) the small scale and incomplete annotation of existing datasets make it hard for model to comprehend geometric knowledge. To tackle the above problems we propose a novel method called Explainable Geometry Problem Solving (E-GPS). E-GPS first parses the geometric diagram and problem text into unified formal language representations. Then the answer and explainable reasoning and solving steps are obtained by a Top-Down Problem Solver (TD-PS) which innovatively solves the problem from the target and focuses on what is needed. To alleviate the data issues a Bottom-Up Problem Generator (BU-PG) is devised to augment the data set with various well-annotated constructed geometry problems. It enables us to train an enhanced theorem predictor with a better grasp of theorem knowledge which further improves the efficiency of TD-PS. Extensive experiments demonstrate that E-GPS maintains comparable solving performances with fewer steps and provides outstanding explainability.,True,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Ugrinovic_MultiPhys_Multi-Person_Physics-aware_3D_Motion_Estimation_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf

CVPR-2024-1619,CVPR,2024,MemFlow: Optical Flow Estimation and Prediction with Memory,"Qiaole Dong, Yanwei Fu",Optical flow is a classical task that is important to the vision community. Classical optical flow estimation uses two frames as input whilst some recent methods consider multiple frames to explicitly model long-range information. The former ones limit their ability to fully leverage temporal coherence along the video sequence; and the latter ones incur heavy computational overhead typically not possible for real-time flow estimation. Some multi-frame-based approaches even necessitate unseen future frames for current estimation compromising real-time applicability in safety-critical scenarios. To this end we present MemFlow a real-time method for optical flow estimation and prediction with memory. Our method enables memory read-out and update modules for aggregating historical motion information in real-time. Furthermore we integrate resolution-adaptive re-scaling to accommodate diverse video resolutions. Besides our approach seamlessly extends to the future prediction of optical flow based on past observations. Leveraging effective historical motion aggregation our method outperforms VideoFlow with fewer parameters and faster inference speed on Sintel and KITTI-15 datasets in terms of generalization performance.

In contrast readily accessible hand-object videos offer a promising training data source but they only give heavily occluded object observations. In this paper we present a novel synthetic-to-real framework to exploit Multi-view Occlusion-aware supervision from hand-object videos for Hand-held Object reconstruction (MOHO) from a single image tackling two predominant challenges in such setting: hand-induced occlusion and object's self-occlusion. First in the synthetic pre-training stage we render a large-scaled synthetic dataset SOMVideo with hand-object images and multi-view occlusion-free supervisions adopted to address hand-induced occlusion in both 2D and 3D spaces. Second in the real-world finetuning stage MOHO leverages the amodal-mask-weighted geometric supervision to mitigate the unfaithful guidance caused by the hand-occluded supervising views in real world. Moreover domain-consistent occlusion-aware features are amalgamated in MOHO to resist object's self-occlusion for inferring the complete object shape. Extensive experiments on HO3D and DexYCB datasets demonstrate 2D-supervised MOHO gains superior results against 3D-supervised methods by a large margin.,True,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Ntinou_Multiscale_Vision_Transformers_Meet_Bipartite_Matching_for_Efficient_Single-stage_Action_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf

However most real-world videos last for minutes or hours and have a complex hierarchical structure spanning different temporal granularities. We propose Video ReCap a recursive video captioning model that can process video inputs of dramatically different lengths (from 1 second to 2 hours) and output video captions at multiple hierarchy levels. The recursive video-language architecture exploits the synergy between different video hierarchies and can process hour-long videos efficiently. We utilize a curriculum learning training scheme to learn the hierarchical structure of videos starting from clip-level captions describing atomic actions then focusing on segment-level descriptions and concluding with generating summaries for hour-long videos. Furthermore we introduce Ego4D-HCap dataset by augmenting Ego4D with 8267 manually collected long-range video summaries.

This immersive perspective brings dramatic visual changes and unique challenges compared to third-person views. Synthetic data has empowered third-person-view vision models but its application to embodied egocentric perception tasks remains largely unexplored. A critical challenge lies in simulating natural human movements and behaviors that effectively steer the embodied cameras to capture a faithful egocentric representation of the 3D world. To address this challenge we introduce EgoGen a new synthetic data generator that can produce accurate and rich ground-truth training data for egocentric perception tasks. At the heart of EgoGen is a novel human motion synthesis model that directly leverages egocentric visual inputs of a virtual human to sense the 3D environment. Combined with collision-avoiding motion primitives and a two-stage reinforcement learning approach our motion synthesis model offers a closed-loop solution where the embodied perception and movement of the virtual human are seamlessly coupled. Compared to previous works our model eliminates the need for a pre-defined global path and is directly applicable to dynamic environments. Combined with our easy-to-use and scalable data generation pipeline we demonstrate EgoGen's efficacy in three tasks: mapping and localization for head-mounted cameras egocentric camera tracking and human mesh recovery from egocentric views.

Although fairness has been investigated in the vision-only domain the fairness of medical vision-language (VL) models remains unexplored due to the scarcity of medical VL datasets for studying fairness. To bridge this research gap we introduce the first fair vision-language medical dataset (Harvard-FairVLMed) that provides detailed demographic attributes ground-truth labels and clinical notes to facilitate an in-depth examination of fairness within VL foundation models. Using Harvard-FairVLMed we conduct a comprehensive fairness analysis of two widely-used VL models (CLIP and BLIP2) pre-trained on both natural and medical domains across four different protected attributes. Our results highlight significant biases in all VL models with Asian Male Non-Hispanic and Spanish being the preferred subgroups across the protected attributes of race gender ethnicity and language respectively. In order to alleviate these biases we propose FairCLIP an optimal-transport-based approach that achieves a favorable trade-off between performance and fairness by reducing the Sinkhorn distance between the overall sample distribution and the distributions corresponding to each demographic group.

The applications of listener agent generation in virtual interaction have promoted many works achieving diverse and fine-grained motion generation. However they can only manipulate motions through simple emotional labels but cannot freely control the listener's motions. Since listener agents should have human-like attributes (e.g. identity personality) which can be freely customized by users this limits their realism. In this paper we propose a user-friendly framework called CustomListener to realize the free-form text prior guided listener generation. To achieve speaker-listener coordination we design a Static to Dynamic Portrait module (SDP) which interacts with speaker information to transform static text into dynamic portrait token with completion rhythm and amplitude information. To achieve coherence between segments we design a Past Guided Generation module (PGG) to maintain the consistency of customized listener attributes through the motion prior and utilize a diffusion-based structure conditioned on the portrait token and the motion prior to realize the controllable generation. To train and evaluate our model we have constructed two text-annotated listening head datasets based on ViCo and RealTalk which provide text-video paired labels.

While recent volumetric head models such as NPHMs can now excel in representing high-fidelity head geometries tracking and reconstructing heads from real-world single-view depth sequences remains very challenging as the fitting to partial and noisy observations is underconstrained. To tackle these challenges we propose a latent diffusion-based prior to regularize volumetric head reconstruction and tracking. This prior-based regularizer effectively constrains the identity and expression codes to lie on the underlying latent manifold which represents plausible head shapes. To evaluate the effectiveness of the diffusion-based prior we collect a dataset of monocular Kinect sequences consisting of various complex facial expression motions and rapid transitions.

However these methods usually ignore the utilization of valuable coding priors inherently embedded in compressed videos such as motion vectors and residual frames which carry abundant temporal and spatial information. To remedy this problem we propose the Coding Priors-Guided Aggregation (CPGA) network to utilize temporal and spatial information from coding priors. The CPGA mainly consists of an inter-frame temporal aggregation (ITA) module and a multi-scale non-local aggregation (MNA) module. Specifically the ITA module aggregates temporal information from consecutive frames and coding priors while the MNA module globally captures spatial information guided by residual frames. In addition to facilitate research in VQE task we newly construct the Video Coding Priors (VCP) dataset comprising 300 videos with various coding priors extracted from corresponding bitstreams.

CVPR-2024-1672,CVPR,2024,Single-View Scene Point Cloud Human Grasp Generation,"Yan-Kang Wang, Chengyi Xing, Yi-Lin Wei, Xiao-Ming Wu, Wei-Shi Zheng",In this work we explore a novel task of generating human grasps based on single-view scene point clouds which more accurately mirrors the typical real-world situation of observing objects from a single viewpoint. Due to the incompleteness of object point clouds and the presence of numerous scene points the generated hand is prone to penetrating into the invisible parts of the object and the model is easily affected by scene points. Thus we introduce S2HGrasp a framework composed of two key modules: the Global Perception module that globally perceives partial object point clouds and the DiffuGrasp module designed to generate high-quality human grasps based on complex inputs that include scene points. Additionally we introduce S2HGD dataset which comprises approximately 99000 single-object single-view scene point clouds of 1668 unique objects each annotated with one human grasp. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that S2HGrasp can not only generate natural human grasps regardless of scene points but also effectively prevent penetration between the hand and invisible parts of the object. Moreover our model showcases strong generalization capability when applied to unseen objects.

CVPR-2024-1675,CVPR,2024,ConvoFusion: Multi-Modal Conversational Diffusion for Co-Speech Gesture Synthesis,"Muhammad Hamza Mughal, Rishabh Dabral, Ikhsanul Habibie, Lucia Donatelli, Marc Habermann, Christian Theobalt",Gestures play a key role in human communication. Recent methods for co-speech gesture generation while managing to generate beat-aligned motions struggle generating gestures that are semantically aligned with the utterance. Compared to beat gestures that align naturally to the audio signal semantically coherent gestures require modeling the complex interactions between the language and human motion and can be controlled by focusing on certain words. Therefore we present ConvoFusion a diffusion-based approach for multi-modal gesture synthesis which can not only generate gestures based on multi-modal speech inputs but can also facilitate controllability in gesture synthesis. Our method proposes two guidance objectives that allow the users to modulate the impact of different conditioning modalities (e.g. audio vs text) as well as to choose certain words to be emphasized during gesturing. Our method is versatile in that it can be trained either for generating monologue gestures or even the conversational gestures. To further advance the research on multi-party interactive gestures the DnD Group Gesture dataset is released which contains 6 hours of gesture data showing 5 people interacting with one another. We compare our method with several recent works and demonstrate effectiveness of our method on a variety of tasks.

Given speech audio we output multiple possibilities of gestural motion for an individual including face body and hands. The key behind our method is in combining the benefits of sample diversity from vector quantization with the high-frequency details obtained through diffusion to generate more dynamic expressive motion. We visualize the generated motion using highly photorealistic avatars that can express crucial nuances in gestures (e.g. sneers and smirks). To facilitate this line of research we introduce a first-of-its-kind multi-view conversational dataset that allows for photorealistic reconstruction. Experiments show our model generates appropriate and diverse gestures outperforming both diffusion- and VQ-only methods. Furthermore our perceptual evaluation highlights the importance of photorealism (vs. meshes) in accurately assessing subtle motion details in conversational gestures.

This paper identifies the importance of being geometry-aware for semantic correspondence and reveals a limitation of the features of current foundation models under simple post-processing. We show that incorporating this information can markedly enhance semantic correspondence performance with simple but effective solutions in both zero-shot and supervised settings. We also construct a new challenging benchmark for semantic correspondence built from an existing animal pose estimation dataset for both pre-training validating models. Our method achieves a PCK@0.10 score of 65.4 (zero-shot) and 85.6 (supervised) on the challenging SPair-71k dataset outperforming the state of the art by 5.5p and 11.0p absolute gains respectively.

CVPR-2024-1683,CVPR,2024,Motion Diversification Networks,"Hee Jae Kim, Eshed Ohn-Bar",We introduce Motion Diversification Networks a novel framework for learning to generate realistic and diverse 3D human motion. Despite recent advances in deep generative motion modeling existing models often fail to produce samples that capture the full range of plausible and natural 3D human motion within a given context. The lack of diversity becomes even more apparent in applications where subtle and multi-modal 3D human forecasting is crucial for safety such as robotics and autonomous driving. Towards more realistic and functional 3D motion models we highlight limitations in existing generative modeling techniques particularly in overly simplistic latent code sampling strategies. We then introduce a transformer-based diversification mechanism that learns to effectively guide sampling in the latent space. Our proposed attention-based module queries multiple stochastic samples to flexibly predict a diverse set of latent codes which can be subsequently decoded into motion samples. The proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art diversity and accuracy prediction performance across a range of benchmarks and settings particularly when used to forecast intricate in-the-wild 3D human motion within complex urban environments.

CVPR-2024-1686,CVPR,2024,Spatio-Temporal Turbulence Mitigation: A Translational Perspective,"Xingguang Zhang, Nicholas Chimitt, Yiheng Chi, Zhiyuan Mao, Stanley H. Chan",Recovering images distorted by atmospheric turbulence is a challenging inverse problem due to the stochastic nature of turbulence. Although numerous turbulence mitigation (TM) algorithms have been proposed their efficiency and generalization to real-world dynamic scenarios remain severely limited. Building upon the intuitions of classical TM algorithms we present the Deep Atmospheric TUrbulence Mitigation network (DATUM). DATUM aims to overcome major challenges when transitioning from classical to deep learning approaches. By carefully integrating the merits of classical multi-frame TM methods into a deep network structure we demonstrate that DATUM can efficiently perform long-range temporal aggregation using a recurrent fashion while deformable attention and temporal-channel attention seamlessly facilitate pixel registration and lucky imaging. With additional supervision tilt and blur degradation can be jointly mitigated. These inductive biases empower DATUM to significantly outperform existing methods while delivering a tenfold increase in processing speed.

Yet efficiently editing these representations while retaining photorealism is an emerging challenge. Recent methods face three primary limitations: they're slow for interactive use lack precision at object boundaries and struggle to ensure multi-view consistency. We introduce IReNe to address these limitations enabling swift near real-time color editing in NeRF. Leveraging a pre-trained NeRF model and a single training image with user-applied color edits IReNe swiftly adjusts network parameters in seconds. This adjustment allows the model to generate new scene views accurately representing the color changes from the training image while also controlling object boundaries and view-specific effects. Object boundary control is achieved by integrating a trainable segmentation module into the model. The process gains efficiency by retraining only the weights of the last network layer. We observed that neurons in this layer can be classified into those responsible for view-dependent appearance and those contributing to diffuse appearance. We introduce an automated classification approach to identify these neuron types and exclusively fine-tune the weights of the diffuse neurons. This further accelerates training and ensures consistent color edits across different views. A thorough validation on a new dataset with edited object colors shows significant quantitative and qualitative advancements over competitors accelerating speeds by 5x and 500x.,True,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Qin_Noisy-Correspondence_Learning_for_Text-to-Image_Person_Re-identification_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
CVPR-2024-1690,CVPR,2024,Towards Real-World HDR Video Reconstruction: A Large-Scale Benchmark Dataset and A Two-Stage Alignment Network,"Yong Shu, Liquan Shen, Xiangyu Hu, Mengyao Li, Zihao Zhou",As an important and practical way to obtain high dynamic range (HDR) video HDR video reconstruction from sequences with alternating exposures is still less explored mainly due to the lack of large-scale real-world datasets. Existing methods are mostly trained on synthetic datasets which perform poorly in real scenes. In this work to facilitate the development of real-world HDR video reconstruction we present Real-HDRV a large-scale real-world benchmark dataset for HDR video reconstruction featuring various scenes diverse motion patterns and high-quality labels. Specifically our dataset contains 500 LDRs-HDRs video pairs comprising about 28000 LDR frames and 4000 HDR labels covering daytime nighttime indoor and outdoor scenes. To our best knowledge our dataset is the largest real-world HDR video reconstruction dataset. Correspondingly we propose an end-to-end network for HDR video reconstruction where a novel two-stage strategy is designed to perform alignment sequentially. Specifically the first stage performs global alignment with the adaptively estimated global offsets reducing the difficulty of subsequent alignment. The second stage implicitly performs local alignment in a coarse-to-fine manner at the feature level using the adaptive separable convolution. Extensive experiments demonstrate that: (1) models trained on our dataset can achieve better performance on real scenes than those trained on synthetic datasets; (2) our method outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods.

Our approach employs a novel trident network structure that separates structure and appearance control ensuring precise and creative editing capabilities. Utilizing the foundational ControlNet architecture we maintain the structural integrity of the video during editing. The incorporation of an additional appearance branch enables users to exert fine-grained control over the edited key frame. These two side branches seamlessly integrate into the main branch which is constructed upon existing text-to-image (T2I) generation models through learnable temporal layers. The versatility of our framework is demonstrated through a diverse range of choices in both structure representations and personalized T2I models as well as the option to provide the edited key frame. To facilitate comprehensive evaluation we introduce the BalanceCC benchmark dataset comprising 100 videos and 4 target prompts for each video. Our extensive user studies compare CCEdit with eight state-of-the-art video editing methods.

In this paper we investigate this task from a few-shot unconstrained photo album. The reconstruction of human avatars from such data sources is challenging because of limited data amount and dynamic articulated poses. For handling dynamic data we integrate a skinning mechanism with deep marching tetrahedra (DMTet) to form a drivable tetrahedral representation which drives arbitrary mesh topologies generated by the DMTet for the adaptation of unconstrained images. To effectively mine instructive information from few-shot data we devise a two-phase optimization method with few-shot reference and few-shot guidance. The former focuses on aligning avatar identity with reference images while the latter aims to generate plausible appearances for unseen regions. Overall our framework called HaveFun can undertake avatar reconstruction rendering and animation. Extensive experiments on our developed benchmarks demonstrate that HaveFun exhibits substantially superior performance in reconstructing the human body and hand.,True,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Bello_Novel_View_Synthesis_with_View-Dependent_Effects_from_a_Single_Image_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
CVPR-2024-1714,CVPR,2024,Leveraging Cross-Modal Neighbor Representation for Improved CLIP Classification,"Chao Yi, Lu Ren, De-Chuan Zhan, Han-Jia Ye",CLIP showcases exceptional cross-modal matching capabilities due to its training on image-text contrastive learning tasks. However without specific optimization for unimodal scenarios its performance in single-modality feature extraction might be suboptimal. Despite this some studies have directly used CLIP's image encoder for tasks like few-shot classification introducing a misalignment between its pre-training objectives and feature extraction methods. This inconsistency can diminish the quality of the image's feature representation adversely affecting CLIP's effectiveness in target tasks. In this paper we view text features as precise neighbors of image features in CLIP's space and present a novel CrOss-moDal nEighbor Representation (CODER) based on the distance structure between images and their neighbor texts. This feature extraction method aligns better with CLIP's pre-training objectives thereby fully leveraging CLIP's robust cross-modal capabilities. The key to construct a high-quality CODER lies in how to create a vast amount of high-quality and diverse texts to match with images. We introduce the Auto Text Generator (ATG) to automatically produce the required text in a data-free and training-free manner. We apply CODER to CLIP's zero-shot and few-shot image classification tasks. Experiment results across various datasets and models confirm CODER's effectiveness.

In this paper we analyze the anime production workflow and rethink how to use characteristics of it for the sake of the real-world anime SR. First we argue that video networks and datasets are not necessary for anime SR due to the repetition use of hand-drawing frames. Instead we propose an anime image collection pipeline by choosing the least compressed and the most informative frames from the video sources. Based on this pipeline we introduce the Anime Production-oriented Image (API) dataset. In addition we identify two anime-specific challenges of distorted and faint hand-drawn lines and unwanted color artifacts. We address the first issue by introducing a prediction-oriented compression module in the image degradation model and a pseudo-ground truth preparation with enhanced hand-drawn lines. In addition we introduce the balanced twin perceptual loss combining both anime and photorealistic high-level features to mitigate unwanted color artifacts and increase visual clarity.

However the methods used by existing frameworks to curate such multimodal data in particular language descriptions for 3D shapes are not scalable and the collected language descriptions are not diverse. To address this we introduce ULIP-2 a simple yet effective tri-modal pretraining framework that leverages large multimodal models to automatically generate holistic language descriptions for 3D shapes. It only needs 3D data as input eliminating the need for any manual 3D annotations and is therefore scalable to large datasets. ULIP-2 is also equipped with scaled-up backbones for better multi-modal representation learning. We conduct experiments on two large-scale 3D datasets Objaverse and ShapeNet and augment them with tri-modal datasets of 3D point clouds images and language for training ULIP-2. Experiments show that ULIP-2 demonstrates substantial benefits in three downstream tasks: zero-shot 3D classification standard 3D classification with fine-tuning and 3D captioning (3D-to-language generation). It achieves a new SOTA of 50.6% (top- 1) on Objaverse-LVIS and 84.7% (top-1) on ModelNet40 in zero-shot classification. In the ScanObjectNN benchmark for standard fine-tuning ULIP-2 reaches an overall accuracy of 91.5% with a compact model of only 1.4 million parameters. ULIP-2 sheds light on a new paradigm for scalable multimodal 3D representation learning without human annotations and shows significant improvements over existing baselines.

Nevertheless existing methods face significant challenges in non-ideal scenarios such as motion blur or lighting variation which often leads to issues like convergence failures localization drifts and distorted mapping. To address these challenges we propose EN-SLAM the first event-RGBD implicit neural SLAM framework which effectively leverages the high rate and high dynamic range advantages of event data for tracking and mapping. Specifically EN-SLAM proposes a differentiable CRF (Camera Response Function) rendering technique to generate distinct RGB and event camera data via a shared radiance field which is optimized by learning a unified implicit representation with the captured event and RGBD supervision. Moreover based on the temporal difference property of events we propose a temporal aggregating optimization strategy for the event joint tracking and global bundle adjustment capitalizing on the consecutive difference constraints of events significantly enhancing tracking accuracy and robustness. Finally we construct the simulated dataset DEV-Indoors and real captured dataset DEV-Reals containing 6 scenes 17 sequences with practical motion blur and lighting changes for evaluations. Experimental results show that our method outperforms the SOTA methods in both tracking ATE and mapping ACC with a real-time 17 FPS in various challenging environments.

Collins, Yiwen Luo, Yang Li, Kai J Kohlhoff, Deepak Ramachandran, Vidhya Navalpakkam",Recent Text-to-Image (T2I) generation models such as Stable Diffusion and Imagen have made significant progress in generating high-resolution images based on text descriptions. However many generated images still suffer from issues such as artifacts/implausibility misalignment with text descriptions and low aesthetic quality. Inspired by the success of Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) for large language models prior works collected human-provided scores as feedback on generated images and trained a reward model to improve the T2I generation. In this paper we enrich the feedback signal by (i) marking image regions that are implausible or misaligned with the text and (ii) annotating which words in the text prompt are misrepresented or missing on the image. We collect such rich human feedback on 18K generated images (RichHF-18K) and train a multimodal transformer to predict the rich feedback automatically. We show that the predicted rich human feedback can be leveraged to improve image generation for example by selecting high-quality training data to finetune and improve the generative models or by creating masks with predicted heatmaps to inpaint the problematic regions. Notably the improvements generalize to models (Muse) beyond those used to generate the images on which human feedback data were collected (Stable Diffusion variants).

LiDAR-Net is characterized by its non-uniform point distribution e.g. scanning holes and scanning lines.

To bridge this gap we introduce ShapeWalk a carefully designed synthetic dataset designed to advance the field of language-guided shape editing. The dataset consists of 158K unique shapes connected through 26K edit chains with an average length of 14 chained shapes. Each consecutive pair of shapes is associated with precise language instructions describing the applied edits.

We leverage rule-based methods and language models to generate accurate and realistic natural language prompts corresponding to each edit. To illustrate the practicality of our contribution we train neural editor modules in the latent space of shape autoencoders and demonstrate the ability of our dataset to enable a variety of language-guided shape edits. Finally we introduce multi-step editing metrics to benchmark the capacity of our models to perform recursive shape edits.

With advancements in sensor manufacture and multi-modal learning techniques many multi-modal FAS approaches have emerged. However they face challenges in generalizing to unseen attacks and deployment conditions. These challenges arise from (1) modality unreliability where some modality sensors like depth and infrared undergo significant domain shifts in varying environments leading to the spread of unreliable information during cross-modal feature fusion and (2) modality imbalance where training overly relies on a dominant modality hinders the convergence of others reducing effectiveness against attack types that are indistinguishable by sorely using the dominant modality. To address modality unreliability we propose the Uncertainty-Guided Cross-Adapter (U-Adapter) to recognize unreliably detected regions within each modality and suppress the impact of unreliable regions on other modalities. For modality imbalance we propose a Rebalanced Modality Gradient Modulation (ReGrad) strategy to rebalance the convergence speed of all modalities by adaptively adjusting their gradients. Besides we provide the first large-scale benchmark for evaluating multi-modal FAS performance under domain generalization scenarios.

Deep learning methods for SL recognition and translation have achieved promising results. However Sign Language Production (SLP) poses a challenge as the generated motions must be realistic and have precise semantic meaning. Most SLP methods rely on 2D data which hinders their realism. In this work a diffusion-based SLP model is trained on a curated large-scale dataset of 4D signing avatars and their corresponding text transcripts. The proposed method can generate dynamic sequences of 3D avatars from an unconstrained domain of discourse using a diffusion process formed on a novel and anatomically informed graph neural network defined on the SMPL-X body skeleton. Through quantitative and qualitative experiments we show that the proposed method considerably outperforms previous methods of SLP.

Compared with geometry the diverse texture design plays an important role in making 3D biped cartoon characters vivid and charming. Therefore we focus on automatic texture design for cartoon characters based on input instructions. This is challenging for domain-specific requirements and a lack of high-quality data. To address this challenge we propose Make-It-Vivid the first attempt to enable high-quality texture generation from text in UV space. We prepare a detailed text-texture paired data for 3D characters by using vision-question-answering agents. Then we customize a pretrained text-to-image model to generate texture map with template structure while preserving the natural 2D image knowledge. Furthermore to enhance fine-grained details we propose a novel adversarial learning scheme to shorten the domain gap between original dataset and realistic texture domain. Extensive experiments show that our approach outperforms current texture generation methods resulting in efficient character texturing and faithful generation with prompts. Besides we showcase various applications such as out of domain generation and texture stylization.

Rehg, Pinar Yanardag",Recent advancements in diffusion-based models have demonstrated significant success in generating images from text. However video editing models have not yet reached the same level of visual quality and user control. To address this we introduce RAVE a zero-shot video editing method that leverages pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models without additional training. RAVE takes an input video and a text prompt to produce high-quality videos while preserving the original motion and semantic structure. It employs a novel noise shuffling strategy leveraging spatio-temporal interactions between frames to produce temporally consistent videos faster than existing methods. It is also efficient in terms of memory requirements allowing it to handle longer videos. RAVE is capable of a wide range of edits from local attribute modifications to shape transformations. In order to demonstrate the versatility of RAVE we create a comprehensive video evaluation dataset ranging from object-focused scenes to complex human activities like dancing and typing and dynamic scenes featuring swimming fish and boats. Our qualitative and quantitative experiments highlight the effectiveness of RAVE in diverse video editing scenarios compared to existing methods.

Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLM) have recently achieved impressive performance on vision-language tasks ranging from visual question-answering and image captioning to visual reasoning and image generation. However when prompted to identify or count (perceive) the entities in a given image existing MLLM systems fail. Working towards developing an accurate MLLM system for perception and reasoning we propose using Versatile vision enCoders (VCoder) as perception eyes for Multimodal LLMs. We feed the VCoder with perception modalities such as segmentation or depth maps improving the MLLM's perception abilities. Secondly we leverage the images from COCO and outputs from off-the-shelf vision perception models to create our COCO Segmentation Text (COST) dataset for training and evaluating MLLMs on the object perception task.

While some efforts have been made to explore the synthesis of scene text images a notable gap remains between synthetic and authentic data. In this paper we introduce a novel method that utilizes Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) to model real-world scenes and emulate the data collection process by rendering images from diverse camera perspectives enriching the variability and realism of the synthesized data. A semi-supervised learning framework is proposed to categorize semantic regions within 3D scenes ensuring consistent labeling of text regions across various viewpoints. Our method also models the pose and view-dependent appearance of text regions thereby offering precise control over camera poses and significantly improving the realism of text insertion and editing within scenes. Employing our technique on real-world scenes has led to the creation of a novel scene text image dataset. Compared to other existing benchmarks the proposed dataset is distinctive in providing not only standard annotations such as bounding boxes and transcriptions but also the information of 3D pose attributes for text regions enabling a more detailed evaluation of the robustness of text detection algorithms.

Many image datasets exist consisting of trichromatic intensity images taken with RGB cameras which are designed to replicate human vision. However polarization and spectrum the wave properties of light that animals in harsh environments and with limited brain capacity often rely on remain underrepresented in existing datasets.

However many of these datasets fail to incorporate a full range of driving conditions; some datasets only contain clear-weather conditions underrepresenting or entirely missing colder weather conditions such as snow or autumn scenes with bright colorful foliage. In this paper we present the Michigan State University Four Seasons (MSU-4S) Dataset which contains real-world collections of autonomous vehicle data from varied types of driving scenarios. These scenarios were recorded throughout a full range of seasons and capture clear rainy snowy and fall weather conditions at varying times of day. MSU-4S contains more than 100000 two- and three-dimensional frames for camera lidar and radar data as well as Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) wheel speed and steering data all annotated with weather time-of-day and time-of-year. Our data includes cluttered scenes that have large numbers of vehicles and pedestrians; and it also captures industrial scenes busy traffic thoroughfare with traffic lights and numerous signs and scenes with dense foliage. While providing a diverse set of scenes our data incorporate an important feature: virtually every scene and its corresponding lidar camera and radar frames were captured in four different seasons enabling unparalleled object detection analysis and testing of the domain shift problem across weather conditions. In that context we present detailed analyses for 3D and 2D object detection showing a strong domain shift effect among MSU-4S data segments collected across different conditions. MSU-4S will also enable advanced multimodal fusion research including different combinations of camera-lidar-radar fusion which continues to be of strong interest for the computer vision autonomous driving and ADAS development communities.

However most benchmarks predominantly assess spatial understanding in the static image tasks while overlooking temporal understanding in the dynamic video tasks. To alleviate this issue we introduce a comprehensive Multi-modal Video understanding Benchmark namely MVBench which covers 20 challenging video tasks that cannot be effectively solved with a single frame. Specifically we first introduce a novel static-to-dynamic method to define these temporal-related tasks. By transforming various static tasks into dynamic ones we enable the systematic generation of video tasks that require a broad spectrum of temporal skills ranging from perception to cognition. Then guided by the task definition we automatically convert public video annotations into multiple-choice QA to evaluate each task. On one hand such a distinct paradigm allows us to build MVBench efficiently without much manual intervention. On the other hand it guarantees evaluation fairness with ground-truth video annotations avoiding the biased scoring of LLMs. Moreover we further develop a robust video MLLM baseline i.e. VideoChat2 by progressive multi-modal training with diverse instruction-tuning data. The extensive results on our MVBench reveal that the existing MLLMs are far from satisfactory in temporal understanding while our VideoChat2 largely surpasses these leading models by over 15% on MVBench.,True,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Haas_PIGEON_Predicting_Image_Geolocations_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
CVPR-2024-1805,CVPR,2024,Revisiting Single Image Reflection Removal In the Wild,"Yurui Zhu, Xueyang Fu, Peng-Tao Jiang, Hao Zhang, Qibin Sun, Jinwei Chen, Zheng-Jun Zha, Bo Li",This research focuses on the issue of single-image reflection removal (SIRR) in real-world conditions examining it from two angles: the collection pipeline of real reflection pairs and the perception of real reflection locations. We devise an advanced reflection collection pipeline that is highly adaptable to a wide range of real-world reflection scenarios and incurs reduced costs in collecting large-scale aligned reflection pairs. In the process we develop a large-scale high-quality reflection dataset named Reflection Removal in the Wild (RRW). RRW contains over 14950 high-resolution real-world reflection pairs a dataset forty-five times larger than its predecessors. Regarding perception of reflection locations we identify that numerous virtual reflection objects visible in reflection images are not present in the corresponding ground-truth images. This observation drawn from the aligned pairs leads us to conceive the Maximum Reflection Filter (MaxRF). The MaxRF could accurately and explicitly characterize reflection locations from pairs of images. Building upon this we design a reflection location-aware cascaded framework specifically tailored for SIRR.

Existing manufacturers usually rely on human eye observation to complete PBD which makes it difficult to balance the accuracy and efficiency of detection. To address this issue and drive more attention into this meaningful task we first elaborately collect a dataset called X-ray PBD which has 1500 diverse X-ray images selected from thousands of power batteries of 5 manufacturers with 7 different visual interference. Then we propose a novel segmentation-based solution for PBD termed multi-dimensional collaborative network (MDCNet). With the help of line and counting predictors the representation of the point segmentation branch can be improved at both semantic and detail aspects. Besides we design an effective distance-adaptive mask generation strategy which can alleviate the visual challenge caused by the inconsistent distribution density of plates to provide MDCNet with stable supervision. Without any bells and whistles our segmentation-based MDCNet consistently outperforms various other corner detection crowd counting and general/tiny object detection-based solutions making it a strong baseline that can help facilitate future research in PBD.

However these datasets are usually collected from a single vehicle's one-time pass of a certain location lacking multiagent interactions or repeated traversals of the same place. Such information could lead to transformative enhancements in autonomous vehicles' perception prediction and planning capabilities. To bridge this gap in collaboration with the self-driving company May Mobility we present the MARS dataset which unifies scenarios that enable MultiAgent multitraveRSal and multimodal autonomous vehicle research. More specifically MARS is collected with a fleet of autonomous vehicles driving within a certain geographical area. Each vehicle has its own route and different vehicles may appear at nearby locations. Each vehicle is equipped with a LiDAR and surround-view RGB cameras. We curate two subsets in MARS: one facilitates collaborative driving with multiple vehicles simultaneously present at the same location and the other enables memory retrospection through asynchronous traversals of the same location by multiple vehicles. We conduct experiments in place recognition and neural reconstruction.

Tan",Nighttime conditions pose a significant challenge to color constancy due to the diversity of lighting conditions and the presence of substantial low-light noise. Existing color constancy methods struggle with nighttime scenes frequently leading to imprecise light color estimations. To tackle nighttime color constancy we propose a novel unsupervised domain adaptation approach that utilizes labeled daytime data to facilitate learning on unlabeled nighttime images. To specifically address the unique lighting conditions of nighttime and ensure the robustness of pseudo labels we propose adaptive channel masking and light uncertainty. By selectively masking channels that are less sensitive to lighting conditions adaptive channel masking directs the model to progressively focus on features less affected by variations in light colors and noise. Additionally our model leverages light uncertainty to provide a pixel-wise uncertainty estimation regarding light color prediction which helps avoid learning from incorrect labels. Our model demonstrates a significant improvement in accuracy achieving 21.5% lower Mean Angular Error (MAE) compared to the state-of-the-art method on our nighttime dataset.,True,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Ghanekar_Passive_Snapshot_Coded_Aperture_Dual-Pixel_RGB-D_Imaging_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf

Vehicle-infrastructure cooperation (VIC) becomes one of the important research area. Due to the complexity of traffic conditions such as blind spots and occlusion it greatly limits the perception capabilities of single-view roadside sensing systems. To further enhance the accuracy of roadside perception and provide better information to the vehicle side in this paper we constructed holographic intersections with various layouts to build a large-scale multi-sensor holographic vehicle-infrastructure cooperation dataset called HoloVIC. Our dataset includes 3 different types of sensors (Camera Lidar Fisheye) and employs 4 sensor-layouts based on the different intersections. Each intersection is equipped with 6-18 sensors to capture synchronous data. While autonomous vehicles pass through these intersections for collecting VIC data. HoloVIC contains in total on 100k+ synchronous frames from different sensors. Additionally we annotated 3D bounding boxes based on Camera Fisheye and Lidar.

However current video visual relation detection datasets have two main limitations that hinder the progress of research in this area. First they do not explore complex human-human interactions in multi-person scenarios. Second the relation types of existing datasets have relatively low-level semantics and can be often recognized by appearance or simple prior information without the need for detailed spatio-temporal context reasoning. Nevertheless comprehending high-level interactions between humans is crucial for understanding complex multi-person videos such as sports and surveillance videos. To address this issue we propose a new video visual relation detection task: video human-human interaction detection and build a dataset named SportsHHI for it. SportsHHI contains 34 high-level interaction classes from basketball and volleyball sports. 118075 human bounding boxes and 50649 interaction instances are annotated on 11398 keyframes. To benchmark this we propose a two-stage baseline method and conduct extensive experiments to reveal the key factors for a successful human-human interaction detector.

Recently numerous computer vision methods emerged to automate the process. However observing wild species at remote locations remains a challenging task due to difficult lighting conditions and constraints on power supply and data storage. Event cameras offer unique advantages for battery-dependent remote monitoring due to their low power consumption and high dynamic range capabilities. We use this novel sensor to quantify a behavior in Chinstrap penguins called ecstatic display. We formulate the problem as a temporal action detection task determining the start and end times of the behavior. For this purpose we recorded a colony of breeding penguins in Antarctica for several weeks and labeled event data on 16 nests. The developed method consists of a generator of candidate time intervals (proposals) and a classifier of the actions within them. The experiments show that the event cameras' natural response to motion is effective for continuous behavior monitoring and detection reaching a mean average precision (mAP) of 58% (which increases to 63% in good weather conditions). The results also demonstrate the robustness against various lighting conditions contained in the challenging dataset. The low-power capabilities of the event camera allow it to record significantly longer than with a conventional camera.

Anwer, Eric Xing, Ming-Hsuan Yang, Fahad S. Khan",Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) extend Large Language Models to the vision domain. Initial LMMs used holistic images and text prompts to generate ungrounded textual responses. Recently region-level LMMs have been used to generate visually grounded responses. However they are limited to only referring to a single object category at a time require users to specify the regions or cannot offer dense pixel-wise object grounding. In this work we present Grounding LMM (GLaMM) the first model that can generate natural language responses seamlessly intertwined with corresponding object segmentation masks. GLaMM not only grounds objects appearing in the conversations but is flexible enough to accept both textual and optional visual prompts (region of interest) as input. This empowers users to interact with the model at various levels of granularity both in textual and visual domains. Due to the lack of standard benchmarks for the novel setting of visually Grounded Conversation Generation (GCG) we introduce a comprehensive evaluation protocol with our curated grounded conversations. Our proposed GCG task requires densely grounded concepts in natural scenes at a large-scale. To this end we propose a densely annotated Grounding-anything Dataset (GranD) using our proposed automated annotation pipeline that encompasses 7.5M unique concepts grounded in a total of 810M regions available with segmentation masks.

We generate 1M+ human-object interaction pairs in 3D and leverage this large-scale data to train our HDM (Hierarchical Diffusion Model) a novel method to reconstruct interacting human and unseen object instances without any templates. Our HDM is an image-conditioned diffusion model that learns both realistic interaction and highly accurate human and object shapes. Experiments show that our HDM trained with ProciGen significantly outperforms prior methods that require template meshes and our dataset allows training methods with strong generalization ability to unseen object instances.

Evaluation studies have emerged to assess their abilities with the majority focusing on the third-person perspective and only a few addressing specific tasks from the first-person perspective. However the capability of VLMs to ""think"" from a first-person perspective a crucial attribute for advancing autonomous agents and robotics remains largely unexplored. To bridge this research gap we introduce EgoThink a novel visual question-answering benchmark that encompasses six core capabilities with twelve detailed dimensions. The benchmark is constructed using selected clips from egocentric videos with manually annotated question-answer pairs containing first-person information. To comprehensively assess VLMs we evaluate twenty-one popular VLMs on EgoThink. Moreover given the open-ended format of the answers we use GPT-4 as the automatic judge to compute single-answer grading. Experimental results indicate that although GPT-4V leads in numerous dimensions all evaluated VLMs still possess considerable potential for improvement in first-person perspective tasks. Meanwhile enlarging the number of trainable parameters has the most significant impact on model performance on EgoThink. In conclusion EgoThink serves as a valuable addition to existing evaluation benchmarks for VLMs providing an indispensable resource for future research in the realm of embodied artificial intelligence and robotics.",True,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Yu_Pose-Transformed_Equivariant_Network_for_3D_Point_Trajectory_Prediction_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf

However alongside immersive visual experiences immersive auditory experiences are equally vital to our holistic perception of an environment. In this paper we aim to reconstruct the spatial acoustic characteristics of an arbitrary environment given only a sparse set of (roughly 12) room impulse response (RIR) recordings and a planar reconstruction of the scene a setup that is easily achievable by ordinary users. To this end we introduce DiffRIR a differentiable RIR rendering framework with interpretable parametric models of salient acoustic features of the scene including sound source directivity and surface reflectivity. This allows us to synthesize novel auditory experiences through the space with any source audio. To evaluate our method we collect a dataset of RIR recordings and music in four diverse real environments.

Our framework consists of an action segmentation model and a contrastive step prototype learning module to segment actions and learn useful features for error detection. Based on the observation that interactions between hands and objects often inform action and error understanding we propose to combine holistic frame features with relations features which we learn by building a graph using active object detection followed by a Graph Convolutional Network. To handle errors unseen during training we use our contrastive step prototype learning to learn multiple prototypes for each step capturing variations of error-free step executions. At inference time we use feature-prototype similarities for error detection.

Yet existing NeRF algorithms overlook this nature of X-ray leading to their limitations in capturing structural contents of imaged objects. In this paper we propose a framework Structure-Aware X-ray Neural Radiodensity Fields (SAX-NeRF) for sparse-view X-ray 3D reconstruction.

Unfortunately existing image space detectors quickly become obsolete as new high-fidelity text-to-image models are developed at blinding speed. In this work we propose a new synthetic image detector that uses features obtained by inverting an open-source pre-trained Stable Diffusion model. We show that these inversion features enable our detector to generalize well to unseen generators of high visual fidelity (e.g. DALL*E 3) even when the detector is trained only on lower fidelity fake images generated via Stable Diffusion. This detector achieves new state-of-the-art across multiple training and evaluation setups.

To address this we introduce RegionGPT (short as RGPT) a novel framework designed for complex region-level captioning and understanding. RGPT enhances the spatial awareness of regional representation with simple yet effective modifications to existing visual encoders in VLMs. We further improve performance on tasks requiring a specific output scope by integrating task-guided instruction prompts during both training and inference phases while maintaining the model's versatility for general-purpose tasks. Additionally we develop an automated region caption data generation pipeline enriching the training set with detailed region-level captions.

Recent advancements in multimodal models primarily stem from the powerful reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). However the visual component typically depends only on the instance-level contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP). Our research reveals that the visual capabilities in recent MultiModal LLMs (MLLMs) still exhibit systematic shortcomings. To understand the roots of these errors we explore the gap between the visual embedding space of CLIP and vision-only self-supervised learning. We identify ""CLIP-blind pairs"" - images that CLIP perceives as similar despite their clear visual differences. With these pairs we construct the Multimodal Visual Patterns (MMVP) benchmark. MMVP exposes areas where state-of-the-art systems including GPT-4V struggle with straightforward questions across nine basic visual patterns often providing incorrect answers and hallucinated explanations. We further evaluate various CLIP-based vision-and-language models and found a notable correlation between visual patterns that challenge CLIP models and those problematic for multimodal LLMs. As an initial effort to address these issues we propose a Mixture of Features (MoF) approach demonstrating that integrating vision self-supervised learning features with MLLMs can significantly enhance their visual grounding capabilities.

However it can be observed that ambiguities are still inevitable when considering the marginal non-crack region due to low contrast and heterogeneous texture. To solve this problem we propose a novel clustering-inspired representation learning framework which contains a two-phase strategy for automatic crack segmentation. In the first phase a pre-process is proposed to localize the marginal non-crack region. Then we propose an ambiguity-aware segmentation loss (Aseg Loss) that enables crack segmentation models to capture ambiguities in the above regions via learning segmentation variance which allows us to further localize ambiguous regions. In the second phase to learn the discriminative features of the above regions we propose a clustering-inspired loss (CI Loss) that alters the supervision learning of these regions into an unsupervised clustering manner.

Previous methods usually follow a similar architecture completing the rearrangement task by aligning the scene changes of the goal and shuffled configuration according to the semantic scene graphs. However constructing scene graphs requires the inference of category labels which not only causes the accuracy drop of the entire task but also limits the application in real world scenario. In this paper we delve deep into the essence of visual rearrangement task and focus on the two most essential issues scene change detection and scene change matching. We utilize the movement and the protrusion of point cloud to accurately identify the scene changes and match these changes depending on the similarity of category agnostic appearance feature. Moreover to assist the agent to explore the environment more efficiently and comprehensively we propose a closer-aligned-retrace exploration policy aiming to observe more details of the scene at a closer distance.

However due to the enormous diversity in input-output formats in the vision domain existing general-purpose models fail to successfully integrate segmentation and multi-image inputs with coarse-level tasks into a single framework. In this work we introduce VistaLLM a powerful visual system that addresses coarse- and fine grained VL tasks over single and multiple input images using a unified framework. VistaLLM utilizes an instruction-guided image tokenizer that filters global embeddings using task descriptions to extract compressed and refined features from numerous images.

F. Tan, Song Bai",Accurate and controllable image editing is a challenging task that has attracted significant attention recently. Notably DragGAN developed by Pan et al. (2023) is an interactive point-based image editing framework that achieves impressive editing results with pixel-level precision. However due to its reliance on generative adversarial networks (GANs) its generality is limited by the capacity of pretrained GAN models. In this work we extend this editing framework to diffusion models and propose a novel approach DragDiffusion. By harnessing large-scale pretrained diffusion models we greatly enhance the applicability of interactive point-based editing on both real and diffusion-generated images. Unlike other diffusion-based editing methods that provide guidance on diffusion latents of multiple time steps our approach achieves efficient yet accurate spatial control by optimizing the latent of only one time step. This novel design is motivated by our observations that UNet features at a specific time step provides sufficient semantic and geometric information to support the drag-based editing. Moreover we introduce two additional techniques namely identity-preserving fine-tuning and reference-latent-control to further preserve the identity of the original image. Lastly we present a challenging benchmark dataset called DragBench---the first benchmark to evaluate the performance of interactive point-based image editing methods.

When body parts are seen the movements of hands and feet will be guided by the images; when unseen the laws of physics guide the controller to generate plausible motion.

Addressing this gap we propose AnyScene a specialized framework designed to create varied scenes from composited foreground using textual prompts. AnyScene addresses the primary challenges inherent in existing methods particularly scene disharmony due to a lack of foreground semantic understanding and distortion of foreground elements. Specifically we develop a foreground injection module that guides a pre-trained diffusion model to generate cohesive scenes in visual harmony with the provided foreground. To enhance robust generation we implement a layout control strategy that prevents distortions of foreground elements. Furthermore an efficient image blending mechanism seamlessly reintegrates foreground details into the generated scenes producing outputs with overall visual harmony and precise foreground details. In addition we propose a new benchmark and a series of quantitative metrics to evaluate this proposed image customization task. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of AnyScene which confirms its potential in various applications.,True,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Wu_Relational_Matching_for_Weakly_Semi-Supervised_Oriented_Object_Detection_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf

However existing monocular approaches still struggle to recover fine geometric details such as face hands or cloth wrinkles. They are also easily prone to depth ambiguities that result in distorted geometries along the camera optical axis. In this paper we explore the benefits of incorporating depth observations in the reconstruction process by introducing ANIM a novel method that reconstructs arbitrary 3D human shapes from single-view RGB-D images with an unprecedented level of accuracy. Our model learns geometric details from both multi-resolution pixel-aligned and voxel-aligned features to leverage depth information and enable spatial relationships mitigating depth ambiguities. We further enhance the quality of the reconstructed shape by introducing a depth-supervision strategy which improves the accuracy of the signed distance field estimation of points that lie on the reconstructed surface. Experiments demonstrate that ANIM outperforms state-of-the-art works that use RGB surface normals point cloud or RGB-D data as input. In addition we introduce ANIM-Real a new multi-modal dataset comprising high-quality scans paired with consumer-grade RGB-D camera and our protocol to fine-tune ANIM enabling high-quality reconstruction from real-world human capture.,True,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Seo_Relaxed_Contrastive_Learning_for_Federated_Learning_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf

However in the realm of 3D vision while remarkable progress has been made with models trained on large-scale synthetic and real-captured object data like Objaverse and MVImgNet a similar level of progress has not been observed in the domain of human-centric tasks partially due to the lack of a large-scale human dataset. Existing datasets of high-fidelity 3D human capture continue to be mid-sized due to the significant challenges in acquiring large-scale high-quality 3D human data. To bridge this gap we present MVHumanNet a dataset that comprises multi-view human action sequences of 4500 human identities. The primary focus of our work is on collecting human data that features a large number of diverse identities and everyday clothing using a multi-view human capture system which facilitates easily scalable data collection. Our dataset contains 9000 daily outfits 60000 motion sequences and 645 million frames with extensive annotations including human masks camera parameters 2D and 3D keypoints SMPL/SMPLX parameters and corresponding textual descriptions. To explore the potential of MVHumanNet in various 2D and 3D visual tasks we conducted pilot studies on view-consistent action recognition human NeRF reconstruction text-driven view-unconstrained human image generation as well as 2D view-unconstrained human image and 3D avatar generation.

To solve this problem we introduce GPT4Point an innovative groundbreaking point-language multimodal model designed specifically for unified 3D object understanding and generation within the MLLM framework. GPT4Point as a powerful 3D MLLM seamlessly can execute a variety of point-text reference tasks such as point-cloud captioning and Q&A. Additionally GPT4Point is equipped with advanced capabilities for controllable 3D generation it can get high-quality results through a low-quality point-text feature maintaining the geometric shapes and colors. To support the expansive needs of 3D object-text pairs we develop Pyramid-XL a point-language dataset annotation engine. It constructs a large-scale database over 1M objects of varied text granularity levels from the Objaverse-XL dataset essential for training GPT4Point.

Such systems cannot actively reason and comprehend implicit user intention. In this work we propose a new segmentation task --- reasoning segmentation. The task is designed to output a segmentation mask given a complex and implicit query text. Furthermore we establish a benchmark comprising over one thousand image-instruction-mask data samples incorporating intricate reasoning and world knowledge for evaluation purposes. Finally we present LISA: large Language Instructed Segmentation Assistant which inherits the language generation capabilities of multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) while also possessing the ability to produce segmentation masks. We expand the original vocabulary with a <SEG> token and propose the embedding-as-mask paradigm to unlock the segmentation capability. Remarkably LISA can handle cases involving complex reasoning and world knowledge. Also it demonstrates robust zero-shot capability when trained exclusively on reasoning-free datasets. In addition fine-tuning the model with merely 239 reasoning segmentation data samples results in further performance enhancement. Both quantitative and qualitative experiments show our method effectively unlocks new reasoning segmentation capabilities for multimodal LLMs. Code models and data are available at github.com/dvlab-research/LISA.,True,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Kumar_Revamping_Federated_Learning_Security_from_a_Defenders_Perspective_A_Unified_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf

With this ultimate goal in mind we develop 3D-Fauna an approach that learns a pan-category deformable 3D animal model for more than 100 animal species jointly. One crucial bottleneck of modeling animals is the limited availability of training data which we overcome by learning our model from 2D Internet images. We show that prior approaches which are category-specific fail to generalize to rare species with limited training images. We address this challenge by introducing the Semantic Bank of Skinned Models (SBSM) which automatically discovers a small set of base animal shapes by combining geometric inductive priors with semantic knowledge implicitly captured by an off-the-shelf self-supervised feature extractor. To train such a model we also contribute a new large-scale dataset of diverse animal species.

CVPR-2024-2046,CVPR,2024,Depth-Aware Concealed Crop Detection in Dense Agricultural Scenes,"Liqiong Wang, Jinyu Yang, Yanfu Zhang, Fangyi Wang, Feng Zheng",Concealed Object Detection (COD) aims to identify objects visually embedded in their background. Existing COD datasets and methods predominantly focus on animals or humans ignoring the agricultural domain which often contains numerous small and concealed crops with severe occlusions. In this paper we introduce Concealed Crop Detection (CCD) which extends classic COD to agricultural domains. Experimental study shows that unimodal data provides insufficient information for CCD. To address this gap we first collect a large-scale RGB-D dataset ACOD-12K containing high-resolution crop images and depth maps. Then we propose a foundational framework named Recurrent Iterative Segmentation Network (RISNet). To tackle the challenge of dense objects we employ multi-scale receptive fields to capture objects of varying sizes thus enhancing the detection performance for dense objects. By fusing depth features our method can acquire spatial information about concealed objects to mitigate disturbances caused by intricate backgrounds and occlusions. Furthermore our model adopts a multi-stage iterative approach using predictions from each stage as gate attention to reinforce position information thereby improving the detection accuracy for small objects. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our RISNet achieves new state-of-the-art performance on both newly proposed CCD and classic COD tasks.

Without pursuing novel technical modules we aim to build a simple yet powerful foundation model dealing with any images under any circumstances. To this end we scale up the dataset by designing a data engine to collect and automatically annotate large-scale unlabeled data ( 62M) which significantly enlarges the data coverage and thus is able to reduce the generalization error. We investigate two simple yet effective strategies that make data scaling-up promising. First a more challenging optimization target is created by leveraging data augmentation tools. It compels the model to actively seek extra visual knowledge and acquire robust representations. Second an auxiliary supervision is developed to enforce the model to inherit rich semantic priors from pre-trained encoders. We evaluate its zero-shot capabilities extensively including six public datasets and randomly captured photos. It demonstrates impressive generalization ability. Further through fine-tuning it with metric depth information from NYUv2 and KITTI new SOTAs are set. Our better depth model also results in a better depth-conditioned ControlNet.

However the 3D content generated by existing methods often exhibits distorted outline shapes and inadequate details. To solve this problem we propose a novel framework called Mask-enhanced Progressive Outline-to-Detail optimization (aka. MPOD123) which consists of two stages. Specifically in the first stage MPOD123 utilizes the pretrained view-conditioned diffusion model to guide the outline shape optimization of the 3D content. Given certain viewpoint we estimate outline shape priors in the form of 2D mask from the 3D content by leveraging opacity calculation. In the second stage MPOD123 incorporates Detail Appearance Inpainting (DAI) to guide the refinement on local geometry and texture with the shape priors. The essence of DAI lies in the Mask Rectified Cross-Attention (MRCA) which can be conveniently plugged in the stable diffusion model. The MRCA module utilizes the mask to rectify the attention map from each cross-attention layer. Accompanied with this new module DAI is capable of guiding the detail refinement of the 3D content while better preserves the outline shape. To assess the applicability in practical scenarios we contribute a new dataset modeled on real-world e-commerce environments. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments on this dataset and open benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of MPOD123 over the state-of-the-arts.,True,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Qiu_RichDreamer_A_Generalizable_Normal-Depth_Diffusion_Model_for_Detail_Richness_in_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf

Our dataset represents real interiors and contains a diverse set of 18656 models of real-world objects. We investigate the impact of synthetic 3D scene dataset scale and realism on the task of training embodied agents to find and navigate to objects (ObjectGoal navigation). By comparing to synthetic 3D scene datasets from prior work we find that scale helps in generalization but the benefits quickly saturate making visual fidelity and correlation to real-world scenes more important. Our experiments show that agents trained on our smaller-scale dataset can match or outperform agents trained on much larger datasets. Surprisingly we observe that agents trained on just 122 scenes from our dataset outperform agents trained on 10000 scenes from the ProcTHOR-10K dataset in terms of zero-shot generalization in real-world scanned environments.,True,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Edstedt_RoMa_Robust_Dense_Feature_Matching_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
CVPR-2024-2058,CVPR,2024,NViST: In the Wild New View Synthesis from a Single Image with Transformers,"Wonbong Jang, Lourdes Agapito",We propose NViST a transformer-based model for efficient and generalizable novel-view synthesis from a single image for real-world scenes. In contrast to many methods that are trained on synthetic data object-centred scenarios or in a category-specific manner NViST is trained on MVImgNet a large-scale dataset of casually-captured real-world videos of hundreds of object categories with diverse backgrounds. NViST transforms image inputs directly into a radiance field conditioned on camera parameters via adaptive layer normalisation. In practice NViST exploits fine-tuned masked autoencoder (MAE) features and translates them to 3D output tokens via cross-attention while addressing occlusions with self-attention. To move away from object-centred datasets and enable full scene synthesis NViST adopts a 6-DOF camera pose model and only requires relative pose dropping the need for canonicalization of the training data which removes a substantial barrier to it being used on casually captured datasets. We show results on unseen objects and categories from MVImgNet and even generalization to casual phone captures. We conduct qualitative and quantitative evaluations on MVImgNet and ShapeNet to show that our model represents a step forward towards enabling true in-the-wild generalizable novel-view synthesis from a single image.

However obtaining annotated datasets from real radar images crucial for training these networks is challenging especially in scenarios with long-range detection and adverse weather and lighting conditions where radar performance excels. To address this challenge we present RadSimReal an innovative physical radar simulation capable of generating synthetic radar images with accompanying annotations for various radar types and environmental conditions all without the need for real data collection. Remarkably our findings demonstrate that training object detection models on RadSimReal data and subsequently evaluating them on real-world data produce performance levels comparable to models trained and tested on real data from the same dataset and even achieves better performance when testing across different real datasets. RadSimReal offers advantages over other physical radar simulations that it does not necessitate knowledge of the radar design details which are often not disclosed by radar suppliers and has faster run-time.

It can be formed as the mapping from the action physical space to the semantic space. Typically researchers built action datasets according to idiosyncratic choices to define classes and push the envelope of benchmarks respectively. Thus datasets are incompatible with each other like ""Isolated Islands"" due to semantic gaps and various class granularities e.g. do housework in dataset A and wash plate in dataset B. We argue that a more principled semantic space is an urgent need to concentrate the community efforts and enable us to use all datasets together to pursue generalizable action learning. To this end we design a structured action semantic space in view of verb taxonomy hierarchy and covering massive actions. By aligning the classes of previous datasets to our semantic space we gather (image/video/skeleton/MoCap) datasets into a unified database in a unified label system i.e. bridging ""isolated islands"" into a ""Pangea"".

Comprehensive Vision Solution for In-Vehicle Gaze Estimation,"Yihua Cheng, Yaning Zhu, Zongji Wang, Hongquan Hao, Yongwei Liu, Shiqing Cheng, Xi Wang, Hyung Jin Chang",Driver's eye gaze holds a wealth of cognitive and intentional cues crucial for intelligent vehicles. Despite its significance research on in-vehicle gaze estimation remains limited due to the scarcity of comprehensive and well-annotated datasets in real driving scenarios. In this paper we present three novel elements to advance in-vehicle gaze research. Firstly we introduce IVGaze a pioneering dataset capturing in-vehicle gaze collected from 125 individuals and covering a large range of gaze and head within vehicles. Conventional gaze collection systems are inadequate for in-vehicle use. In this dataset we propose a new vision-based solution for in-vehicle gaze collection introducing a refined gaze target calibration method to tackle annotation challenges. Second our research focuses on in-vehicle gaze estimation leveraging the IVGaze. Images of in-vehicle faces often suffer from low resolution prompting our introduction of a gaze pyramid transformer that harnesses transformer-based multilevel features integration. Expanding upon this we introduce the dual-stream gaze pyramid transformer (GazeDPTR). Employing perspective transformation we rotate virtual cameras to normalize images utilizing camera pose to merge normalized and original images for accurate gaze estimation. GazeDPTR showcases state-of-the-art performance on the IVGaze dataset. Thirdly we explore a novel strategy for gaze zone classification by extending the GazeDPTR. A foundational tri-plane and project gaze onto these planes are newly defined. Leveraging both positional features from the projection points and visual attributes from images we achieve superior performance compared to relying solely on visual features thereby substantiating the advantage of gaze estimation.

Our approach unfolds in three stages. First we introduce a lighting representation module that allows our diffusion model to encode lighting information from target image background. Second we introduce an alignment network that aligns lighting features learned from image background with lighting features learned from panorama environment maps which is a complete representation for scene illumination. Last to further boost the photorealism of the proposed method we introduce a novel data simulation pipeline that generates synthetic training pairs from a diverse range of natural images which are used to refine the model.

Dunn",Parkinson's disease (PD) is a devastating movement disorder accelerating in global prevalence but a lack of precision symptom measurement has made the development of effective therapies challenging. The Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) is the gold-standard for assessing motor symptom severity yet its manual scoring criteria are vague and subjective resulting in coarse and noisy clinical assessments. Machine learning approaches have the potential to modernize PD symptom assessments by making them more quantitative objective and scalable. However the lack of benchmark video datasets for PD motor exams hinders model development. Here we introduce the TULIP dataset to bridge this gap. TULIP emphasizes precision and comprehensiveness comprising multi-view video recordings (6 cameras) of all 25 UPDRS motor exam components together with ratings by 3 clinical experts in a cohort of Parkinson's patients and healthy controls. The multi-view recordings enable 3D reconstructions of body movement that better capture disease signatures than more conventional 2D methods.

Nevertheless there exists unseen classes from target domains in practical scenarios. To address this issue Open Set Domain Generalization (OSDG) has emerged and several methods have been exclusively proposed. However most existing methods adopt complex architectures with slight improvement compared with DG methods. Recently vision-language models (VLMs) have been introduced in DG following the fine-tuning paradigm but consume huge training overhead with large vision models. Therefore in this paper we innovate to transfer knowledge from VLMs to lightweight vision models and improve the robustness by introducing Perturbation Distillation (PD) from three perspectives including Score Class and Instance (SCI) named SCI-PD. Moreover previous methods are oriented by the benchmarks with identical and fixed splits ignoring the divergence between source domains.

The effectiveness of audio-visual learning critically depends on achieving accurate cross-modal alignment between sound and visual objects. Successful audio-visual learning requires two essential components: 1) a challenging dataset with high-quality pixel-level multi-class annotated images associated with audio files and 2) a model that can establish strong links between audio information and its corresponding visual object. However these requirements are only partially addressed by current methods with training sets containing biased audio-visual data and models that generalise poorly beyond this biased training set. In this work we propose a new cost-effective strategy to build challenging and relatively unbiased high-quality audio-visual segmentation benchmarks.

However the lack of abundant real 3D anomaly data limits the scalability of current models. To enable scalable anomaly data collection we propose a 3D anomaly synthesis pipeline to adapt existing large-scale 3D models for 3D anomaly detection. Specifically we construct a synthetic dataset i.e. Anomaly-ShapeNet based on ShapeNet. Anomaly-ShapeNet consists of 1600 point cloud samples under 40 categories which provides a rich and varied collection of data enabling efficient training and enhancing adaptability to industrial scenarios. Meanwhile to enable scalable representation learning for 3D anomaly localization we propose a self-supervised method i.e. Iterative Mask Reconstruction Network (IMRNet). During training we propose a geometry-aware sample module to preserve potentially anomalous local regions during point cloud down-sampling. Then we randomly mask out point patches and sent the visible patches to a transformer for reconstruction-based self-supervision. During testing the point cloud repeatedly goes through the Mask Reconstruction Network with each iteration's output becoming the next input.

CVPR-2024-2134,CVPR,2024,Cam4DOcc: Benchmark for Camera-Only 4D Occupancy Forecasting in Autonomous Driving Applications,"Junyi Ma, Xieyuanli Chen, Jiawei Huang, Jingyi Xu, Zhen Luo, Jintao Xu, Weihao Gu, Rui Ai, Hesheng Wang",Understanding how the surrounding environment changes is crucial for performing downstream tasks safely and reliably in autonomous driving applications. Recent occupancy estimation techniques using only camera images as input can provide dense occupancy representations of large-scale scenes based on the current observation. However they are mostly limited to representing the current 3D space and do not consider the future state of surrounding objects along the time axis. To extend camera-only occupancy estimation into spatiotemporal prediction we propose Cam4DOcc a new benchmark for camera-only 4D occupancy forecasting evaluating the surrounding scene changes in a near future. We build our benchmark based on multiple publicly available datasets including nuScenes nuScenes-Occupancy and Lyft-Level5 which provides sequential occupancy states of general movable and static objects as well as their 3D backward centripetal flow. To establish this benchmark for future research with comprehensive comparisons we introduce four baseline types from diverse camera-based perception and prediction implementations including a static-world occupancy model voxelization of point cloud prediction 2D-3D instance-based prediction and our proposed novel end-to-end 4D occupancy forecasting network. Furthermore the standardized evaluation protocol for preset multiple tasks is also provided to compare the performance of all the proposed baselines on present and future occupancy estimation with respect to objects of interest in autonomous driving scenarios. The dataset and our implementation of all four baselines in the proposed Cam4DOcc benchmark are released as open source at https://github.com/haomo-ai/Cam4DOcc.,True,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Goyal_Scaling_Laws_for_Data_Filtering--_Data_Curation_cannot_be_Compute_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
CVPR-2024-2154,CVPR,2024,LED: A Large-scale Real-world Paired Dataset for Event Camera Denoising,Yuxing Duan,Event camera has significant advantages in capturingdynamic scene information while being prone to noise interferenceparticularly in challenging conditions like lowthreshold and low illumination. However most existing researchfocuses on gentle situations hindering event cameraapplications in realistic complex scenarios. To tackle thislimitation and advance the field we construct a new pairedreal-world event denoising dataset (LED) including 3K sequenceswith 18K seconds of high-resolution (1200*680)event streams and showing three notable distinctions comparedto others: diverse noise levels and scenes largerscalewith high-resolution and high-quality GT. Specificallyit contains stepped parameters and varying illuminationwith diverse scenarios. Moreover based on theproperty of noise events inconsistency and signal eventsconsistency we propose a novel effective denoising framework(DED) using homogeneous dual events to generate theGT with better separating noise from the raw. Furthermorewe design a bio-inspired baseline leveraging Leaky-Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neurons with dynamic thresholdsto realize accurate denoising.

CVPR-2024-2157,CVPR,2024,Inverse Rendering of Glossy Objects via the Neural Plenoptic Function and Radiance Fields,"Haoyuan Wang, Wenbo Hu, Lei Zhu, Rynson W.H. Lau",Inverse rendering aims at recovering both geometry and materials of objects. It provides a more compatible reconstruction for conventional rendering engines compared with the neural radiance fields (NeRFs). On the other hand existing NeRF-based inverse rendering methods cannot handle glossy objects with local light interactions well as they typically oversimplify the illumination as a 2D environmental map which assumes infinite lights only. Observing the superiority of NeRFs in recovering radiance fields we propose a novel 5D Neural Plenoptic Function (NeP) based on NeRFs and ray tracing such that more accurate lighting-object interactions can be formulated via the rendering equation. We also design a material-aware cone sampling strategy to efficiently integrate lights inside the BRDF lobes with the help of pre-filtered radiance fields. Our method has two stages: the geometry of the target object and the pre-filtered environmental radiance fields are reconstructed in the first stage and materials of the target object are estimated in the second stage with the proposed NeP and material-aware cone sampling strategy. Extensive experiments on the proposed real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that our method can reconstruct high-fidelity geometry/materials of challenging glossy objects with complex lighting interactions from nearby objects.

However video background music generation tasks face several challenges for example the lack of suitable training datasets and the difficulties in flexibly controlling the music generation process and sequentially aligning the video and music. In this work we first propose a high-quality music-video dataset BGM909 with detailed annotation and shot detection to provide multi-modal information about the video and music. We then present evaluation metrics to assess music quality including music diversity and alignment between music and video with retrieval precision metrics. Finally we propose the Diff-BGM framework to automatically generate the background music for a given video which uses different signals to control different aspects of the music during the generation process i.e. uses dynamic video features to control music rhythm and semantic features to control the melody and atmosphere. We propose to align the video and music sequentially by introducing a segment-aware cross-attention layer. Experiments verify the effectiveness of our proposed method.

CVPR-2024-2160,CVPR,2024,Event-based Structure-from-Orbit,"Ethan Elms, Yasir Latif, Tae Ha Park, Tat-Jun Chin",Event sensors offer high temporal resolution visual sensing which makes them ideal for perceiving fast visual phenomena without suffering from motion blur. Certain applications in robotics and vision-based navigation require 3D perception of an object undergoing circular or spinning motion in front of a static camera such as recovering the angular velocity and shape of the object. The setting is equivalent to observing a static object with an orbiting camera. In this paper we propose event-based structure-from-orbit (eSfO) where the aim is to simultaneously reconstruct the 3D structure of a fast spinning object observed from a static event camera and recover the equivalent orbital motion of the camera. Our contributions are threefold: since state-of-the-art event feature trackers cannot handle periodic self-occlusion due to the spinning motion we develop a novel event feature tracker based on spatio-temporal clustering and data association that can better track the helical trajectories of valid features in the event data. The feature tracks are then fed to our novel factor graph-based structure-from-orbit back-end that calculates the orbital motion parameters (e.g. spin rate relative rotational axis) that minimize the reprojection error. For evaluation we produce a new event dataset of objects under spinning motion. Comparisons against ground truth indicate the efficacy of eSfO.,True,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Ramrakhya_Seeing_the_Unseen_Visual_Common_Sense_for_Semantic_Placement_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf

This hinders the model to comprehend the fine-grained semantics of query texts in real scenarios. To address this problem we contribute a new benchmark named UFineBench for text-based person retrieval with ultra-fine granularity. Firstly we construct a new dataset named UFine6926. We collect a large number of person images and manually annotate each image with two detailed textual descriptions averaging 80.8 words each. The average word count is three to four times that of the previous datasets. In addition of standard in-domain evaluation we also propose a special evaluation paradigm more representative of real scenarios. It contains a new evaluation set with cross domains cross textual granularity and cross textual styles named UFine3C and a new evaluation metric for accurately measuring retrieval ability named mean Similarity Distribution (mSD). Moreover we propose CFAM a more efficient algorithm especially designed for text-based person retrieval with ultra fine-grained texts. It achieves fine granularity mining by adopting a shared cross-modal granularity decoder and hard negative match mechanism. With standard in-domain evaluation CFAM establishes competitive performance across various datasets especially on our ultra fine-grained UFine6926. Furthermore by evaluating on UFine3C we demonstrate that training on our UFine6926 significantly improves generalization to real scenarios compared with other coarse-grained datasets.

CVPR-2024-2169,CVPR,2024,Reconstructing Hands in 3D with Transformers,"Georgios Pavlakos, Dandan Shan, Ilija Radosavovic, Angjoo Kanazawa, David Fouhey, Jitendra Malik",We present an approach that can reconstruct hands in 3D from monocular input. Our approach for Hand Mesh Recovery HaMeR follows a fully transformer-based architecture and can analyze hands with significantly increased accuracy and robustness compared to previous work. The key to HaMeR's success lies in scaling up both the data used for training and the capacity of the deep network for hand reconstruction. For training data we combine multiple datasets that contain 2D or 3D hand annotations. For the deep model we use a large scale Vision Transformer architecture. Our final model consistently outperforms the previous baselines on popular 3D hand pose benchmarks. To further evaluate the effect of our design in non-controlled settings we annotate existing in-the-wild datasets with 2D hand keypoint annotations. On this newly collected dataset of annotations HInt we demonstrate significant improvements over existing baselines. We will make our code data and models publicly available upon publication.

CVPR-2024-2175,CVPR,2024,Day-Night Cross-domain Vehicle Re-identification,"Hongchao Li, Jingong Chen, Aihua Zheng, Yong Wu, Yonglong Luo",Previous advances in vehicle re-identification (ReID) are mostly reported under favorable lighting conditions while cross-day-and-night performance is neglected which greatly hinders the development of related traffic intelligence applications. This work instead develops a novel Day-Night Dual-domain Modulation (DNDM) vehicle re-identification framework for day-night cross-domain traffic scenarios. Specifically a unique night-domain glare suppression module is provided to attenuate the headlight glare from raw nighttime vehicle images. To enhance vehicle features under low-light environments we propose a dual-domain structure enhancement module in the feature extractor which enhances geometric structures between appearance features. To alleviate day-night domain discrepancies we develop a cross-domain class awareness module that facilitates the interaction between appearance and structure features in both domains. In this work we address the Day-Night cross-domain ReID (DN-ReID) problem and provide a new cross-domain dataset named DN-Wild including day and night images of 2286 identities giving in total 85945 daytime images and 54952 nighttime images. Furthermore we also take into account the matter of balance between day and night samples and provide a dataset called DN-348. Exhaustive experiments demonstrate the robustness of the proposed framework in the DN-ReID problem.

CVPR-2024-2178,CVPR,2024,Effective Video Mirror Detection with Inconsistent Motion Cues,"Alex Warren, Ke Xu, Jiaying Lin, Gary K.L. Tam, Rynson W.H. Lau",Image-based mirror detection has recently undergone rapid research due to its significance in applications such as robotic navigation semantic segmentation and scene reconstruction. Recently VMD-Net was proposed as the first video mirror detection technique by modeling dual correspondences between the inside and outside of the mirror both spatially and temporally. However this approach is not reliable as correspondences can occur completely inside or outside of the mirrors. In addition the proposed dataset VMD-D contains many small mirrors limiting its applicability to real-world scenarios. To address these problems we developed a more challenging dataset that includes mirrors of various shapes and sizes at different locations of the frames providing a better reflection of real-world scenarios. Next we observed that the motions between the inside and outside of the mirror are often inconsistent. For instance when moving in front of a mirror the motion inside the mirror is often much smaller than the motion outside due to increased depth perception. With these observations we propose modeling inconsistent motion cues to detect mirrors and a new network with two novel modules. The Motion Attention Module (MAM) explicitly models inconsistent motions around mirrors via optical flow and the Motion-Guided Edge Detection Module (MEDM) uses motions to guide mirror edge feature learning. Experimental results on our proposed dataset show that our method outperforms state-of-the-arts.

CVPR-2024-2183,CVPR,2024,Communication-Efficient Collaborative Perception via Information Filling with Codebook,"Yue Hu, Juntong Peng, Sifei Liu, Junhao Ge, Si Liu, Siheng Chen",Collaborative perception empowers each agent to improve its perceptual ability through the exchange of perceptual messages with other agents. It inherently results in a fundamental trade-off between perception ability and communication cost. To address this bottleneck issue our core idea is to optimize the collaborative messages from two key aspects: representation and selection. The proposed codebook-based message representation enables the transmission of integer codes rather than high-dimensional feature maps. The proposed information-filling-driven message selection optimizes local messages to collectively fill each agent's information demand preventing information overflow among multiple agents. By integrating these two designs we propose CodeFilling a novel communication-efficient collaborative perception system which significantly advances the perception-communication trade-off and is inclusive to both homogeneous and heterogeneous collaboration settings. We evaluate CodeFilling in both a real-world dataset DAIR-V2X and a new simulation dataset OPV2VH+. Results show that CodeFilling outperforms previous SOTA Where2comm on DAIR-V2X/OPV2VH+ with 1333/1206x lower communication volume.

CVPR-2024-2187,CVPR,2024,NetTrack: Tracking Highly Dynamic Objects with a Net,"Guangze Zheng, Shijie Lin, Haobo Zuo, Changhong Fu, Jia Pan",The complex dynamicity of open-world objects presents non-negligible challenges for multi-object tracking (MOT) often manifested as severe deformations fast motion and occlusions. Most methods that solely depend on coarse-grained object cues such as boxes and the overall appearance of the object are susceptible to degradation due to distorted internal relationships of dynamic objects. To address this problem this work proposes NetTrack an efficient generic and affordable tracking framework to introduce fine-grained learning that is robust to dynamicity. Specifically NetTrack constructs a dynamicity-aware association with a fine-grained Net leveraging point-level visual cues. Correspondingly a fine-grained sampler and matching method have been incorporated. Furthermore NetTrack learns object-text correspondence for fine-grained localization. To evaluate MOT in extremely dynamic open-world scenarios a bird flock tracking (BFT) dataset is constructed which exhibits high dynamicity with diverse species and open-world scenarios. Comprehensive evaluation on BFT validates the effectiveness of fine-grained learning on object dynamicity and thorough transfer experiments on challenging open-world benchmarks i.e. TAO TAO-OW AnimalTrack and GMOT-40 validate the strong generalization ability of NetTrack even without finetuning.,True,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Ko_Semantic_Line_Combination_Detector_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf

However current prevailing facial texture generation methods generally suffer from low-quality texture identity information loss and inadequate handling of occlusions. To solve these problems we introduce an Identity-Conditioned Latent Diffusion Model for face UV-texture generation (UV-IDM) to generate photo-realistic textures based on the Basel Face Model (BFM). UV-IDM leverages the powerful texture generation capacity of a latent diffusion model (LDM) to obtain detailed facial textures. To preserve the identity during the reconstruction procedure we design an identity-conditioned module that can utilize any in-the-wild image as a robust condition for the LDM to guide texture generation. UV-IDM can be easily adapted to different BFM-based methods as a high-fidelity texture generator. Furthermore in light of the limited accessibility of most existing UV-texture datasets we build a large-scale and publicly available UV-texture dataset based on BFM termed BFM-UV. Extensive experiments show that our UV-IDM can generate high-fidelity textures in 3D face reconstruction within seconds while maintaining image consistency bringing new state-of-the-art performance in facial texture generation.,True,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Wei_Semantic-aware_SAM_for_Point-Prompted_Instance_Segmentation_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
CVPR-2024-2192,CVPR,2024,Let's Think Outside the Box: Exploring Leap-of-Thought in Large Language Models with Creative Humor Generation,"Shanshan Zhong, Zhongzhan Huang, Shanghua Gao, Wushao Wen, Liang Lin, Marinka Zitnik, Pan Zhou","Chain-of-Thought (CoT) guides large language models (LLMs) to reason step-by-step and can motivate their logical reasoning ability. While effective for logical tasks CoT is not conducive to creative problem-solving which often requires out-of-box thoughts and is crucial for innovation advancements. In this paper we explore the Leap-of-Thought (LoT) abilities within LLMs -- a non-sequential creative paradigm involving strong associations and knowledge leaps. To this end we study LLMs on the popular Oogiri game which needs participants to have good creativity and strong associative thinking for responding unexpectedly and humorously to the given image text or both and thus is suitable for LoT study. Then to investigate LLMs' LoT ability in the Oogiri game we first build a multimodal and multilingual Oogiri-GO dataset which contains over 130000 samples from the Oogiri game and observe the insufficient LoT ability or failures of most existing LLMs on the Oogiri game. Accordingly we introduce a creative Leap-of-Thought (CLoT) paradigm to improve LLM's LoT ability. CLoT first formulates the Oogiri-GO dataset into LoT-oriented instruction tuning data to train pretrained LLM for achieving certain LoT humor generation and discrimination abilities. Then CLoT designs an explorative self-refinement that encourages the LLM to generate more creative LoT data via exploring parallels between seemingly unrelated concepts and selects high-quality data to train itself for self-refinement. CLoT not only excels in humor generation in the Oogiri game as shown in Fig. 1 but also boosts creative abilities in various tasks like ""cloud guessing game"" and ""divergent association task"". These findings advance our understanding and offer a pathway to improve LLMs' creative capacities for innovative applications across domains.

However identifying objects and their parts only constitutes an intermediate step towards a more fine-grained goal which is effectively interacting with the functional interactive elements (e.g. handles knobs buttons) in the scene to accomplish diverse tasks. To this end we introduce SceneFun3D a large-scale dataset with more than 14.8k highly accurate interaction annotations for 710 high-resolution real-world 3D indoor scenes. We accompany the annotations with motion parameter information describing how to interact with these elements and a diverse set of natural language descriptions of tasks that involve manipulating them in the scene context. To showcase the value of our dataset we introduce three novel tasks namely functionality segmentation task-driven affordance grounding and 3D motion estimation and adapt existing state-of-the-art methods to tackle them.

Evaluating the quality of the generative models is one essential step in the development process. Unfortunately the evaluation process could consume a significant amount of computational resources making the required periodic evaluation of model performance (e.g. monitoring training progress) impractical. Therefore we seek to improve the evaluation efficiency by selecting the representative subset of the text-image dataset. We systematically investigate the design choices including the selection criteria (textural features or imagebased metrics) and the selection granularity (prompt-level or set-level). We find that the insights from prior work on subset selection for training data do not generalize to this problem and we propose FlashEval an iterative search algorithm tailored to evaluation data selection. We demonstrate the effectiveness of FlashEval on ranking diffusion models with various configurations including architectures quantization levels and sampler schedules on COCO and DiffusionDB datasets. Our searched 50-item subset could achieve comparable evaluation quality to the randomly sampled 500-item subset for COCO annotations on unseen models achieving a 10x evaluation speedup.

This paradigm lacks pixel-level representations that are important for fine-grained visual understanding and diagnosis. In this work we introduce GROUNDHOG an MLLM developed by grounding Large Language Models to holistic segmentation. GROUNDHOG incorporates a masked feature extractor and converts extracted features into visual entity tokens for the MLLM backbone which then connects groundable phrases to unified grounding masks by retrieving and merging the entity masks. To train GROUNDHOG we carefully curated M3G2 a grounded visual instruction tuning dataset with Multi-Modal Multi-Grained Grounding by harvesting a collection of segmentation-grounded datasets with rich annotations. Our experimental results show that GROUNDHOG achieves superior performance on various language grounding tasks without task-specific fine-tuning and significantly reduces object hallucination.

Specifically it integrates visual prompts into existing language-guided-only HOI detectors to handle situations where textual descriptions face difficulties in generalization and to address complex scenarios with high interaction ambiguity. To facilitate MP-HOI training we build a large-scale HOI dataset named Magic-HOI which gathers six existing datasets into a unified label space forming over 186K images with 2.4K objects 1.2K actions and 20K HOI interactions. Furthermore to tackle the long-tail issue within the Magic-HOI dataset we introduce an automated pipeline for generating realistically annotated HOI images and present SynHOI a high-quality synthetic HOI dataset containing 100K images. Leveraging these two datasets MP-HOI optimizes the HOI task as a similarity learning process between multi-modal prompts and objects/interactions via a unified contrastive loss to learn generalizable and transferable objects/interactions representations from large-scale data. MP-HOI could serve as a generalist HOI detector surpassing the HOI vocabulary of existing expert models by more than 30 times.

CVPR-2024-2237,CVPR,2024,Atlantis: Enabling Underwater Depth Estimation with Stable Diffusion,"Fan Zhang, Shaodi You, Yu Li, Ying Fu",Monocular depth estimation has experienced significant progress on terrestrial images in recent years thanks to deep learning advancements. But it remains inadequate for underwater scenes primarily due to data scarcity. Given the inherent challenges of light attenuation and backscatter in water acquiring clear underwater images or precise depth is notably difficult and costly. To mitigate this issue learning-based approaches often rely on synthetic data or turn to self- or unsupervised manners. Nonetheless their performance is often hindered by domain gap and looser constraints. In this paper we propose a novel pipeline for generating photorealistic underwater images using accurate terrestrial depth. This approach facilitates the supervised training of models for underwater depth estimation effectively reducing the performance disparity between terrestrial and underwater environments. Contrary to previous synthetic datasets that merely apply style transfer to terrestrial images without scene content change our approach uniquely creates vivid non-existent underwater scenes by leveraging terrestrial depth data through the innovative Stable Diffusion model. Specifically we introduce a specialized Depth2Underwater ControlNet trained on prepared \\\\ Underwater Depth Text\\\\  data triplets for this generation task. Our newly developed dataset Atlantis enables terrestrial depth estimation models to achieve considerable improvements on unseen underwater scenes surpassing their terrestrial pretrained counterparts both quantitatively and qualitatively. Moreover we further show its practical utility by applying the improved depth in underwater image enhancement and its smaller domain gap from the LLVM perspective.

Interestingly existing methods often incur a significant performance drop even if only one frame is affected. To formally evaluate the robustness we establish two temporal corruption robustness benchmarks namely THUMOS14-C and ActivityNet-v1.3-C. In this paper we extensively analyze the robustness of seven leading TAD methods and obtain some interesting findings: 1) Existing methods are particularly vulnerable to temporal corruptions and end-to-end methods are often more susceptible than those with a pre-trained feature extractor; 2) Vulnerability mainly comes from localization error rather than classification error; 3) When corruptions occur in the middle of an action instance TAD models tend to yield the largest performance drop. Besides building a benchmark we further develop a simple but effective robust training method to defend against temporal corruptions through the FrameDrop augmentation and Temporal-Robust Consistency loss. Remarkably our approach not only improves robustness but also yields promising improvements on clean data. We believe that this study will serve as a benchmark for future research in robust video analysis.

CVPR-2024-2242,CVPR,2024,Multi-agent Long-term 3D Human Pose Forecasting via Interaction-aware Trajectory Conditioning,"Jaewoo Jeong, Daehee Park, Kuk-Jin Yoon",Human pose forecasting garners attention for its diverse applications. However challenges in modeling the multi-modal nature of human motion and intricate interactions among agents persist particularly with longer timescales and more agents. In this paper we propose an interaction-aware trajectory-conditioned long-term multi-agent human pose forecasting model utilizing a coarse-to-fine prediction approach: multi-modal global trajectories are initially forecasted followed by respective local pose forecasts conditioned on each mode. In doing so our Trajectory2Pose model introduces a graph-based agent-wise interaction module for a reciprocal forecast of local motion-conditioned global trajectory and trajectory-conditioned local pose. Our model effectively handles the multi-modality of human motion and the complexity of long-term multi-agent interactions improving performance in complex environments. Furthermore we address the lack of long-term (6s+) multi-agent (5+) datasets by constructing a new dataset from real-world images and 2D annotations enabling a comprehensive evaluation of our proposed model. State-of-the-art prediction performance on both complex and simpler datasets confirms the generalized effectiveness of our method.

Most of the HPE datasets and methods primarily rely on RGB LiDAR or IMU data. However solely using these modalities or a combination of them may not be adequate for HPE particularly for complex and fast movements. For holistic human motion understanding we present RELI11D a high-quality multimodal human motion dataset involves LiDAR IMU system RGB camera and Event camera. It records the motions of 10 actors performing 5 sports in 7 scenes including 3.32 hours of synchronized LiDAR point clouds IMU measurement data RGB videos and Event steams. Through extensive experiments we demonstrate that the RELI11D presents considerable challenges and opportunities as it contains many rapid and complex motions that require precise location. To address the challenge of integrating different modalities we propose LEIR a multimodal baseline that effectively utilizes LiDAR Point Cloud Event stream and RGB through our cross-attention fusion strategy. We show that LEIR exhibits promising results for rapid motions and daily motions and that utilizing the characteristics of multiple modalities can indeed improve HPE performance.

Plummer, Zhe Lin",Human image editing includes tasks like changing a person's pose their clothing or editing the image according to a text prompt. However prior work often tackles these tasks separately overlooking the benefit of mutual reinforcement from learning them jointly. In this paper we propose UniHuman a unified model that addresses multiple facets of human image editing in real-world settings. To enhance the model's generation quality and generalization capacity we leverage guidance from human visual encoders and introduce a lightweight pose-warping module that can exploit different pose representations accommodating unseen textures and patterns. Furthermore to bridge the disparity between existing human editing benchmarks with real-world data we curated 400K high-quality human image-text pairs for training and collected 2K human images for out-of-domain testing both encompassing diverse clothing styles backgrounds and age groups. Experiments on both in-domain and out-of-domain test sets demonstrate that UniHuman outperforms task-specific models by a significant margin.

CVPR-2024-2275,CVPR,2024,Multi-Object Tracking in the Dark,"Xinzhe Wang, Kang Ma, Qiankun Liu, Yunhao Zou, Ying Fu",Low-light scenes are prevalent in real-world applications (e.g. autonomous driving and surveillance at night). Recently multi-object tracking in various practical use cases have received much attention but multi-object tracking in dark scenes is rarely considered. In this paper we focus on multi-object tracking in dark scenes. To address the lack of datasets we first build a Low-light Multi-Object Tracking (LMOT) dataset. LMOT provides well-aligned low-light video pairs captured by our dual-camera system and high-quality multi-object tracking annotations for all videos. Then we propose a low-light multi-object tracking method termed as LTrack. We introduce the adaptive low-pass downsample module to enhance low-frequency components of images outside the sensor noises. The degradation suppression learning strategy enables the model to learn invariant information under noise disturbance and image quality degradation. These components improve the robustness of multi-object tracking in dark scenes. We conducted a comprehensive analysis of our LMOT dataset and proposed LTrack. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method and its competitiveness in real night low-light scenes.

For example the Civitai community a platform for T2I innovation currently hosts an impressive array of 74492 distinct models. However this diversity presents a formidable challenge in selecting the most appropriate model and parameters a process that typically requires numerous trials. Drawing inspiration from the tool usage research of large language models (LLMs) we introduce DiffAgent an LLM agent designed to screen the accurate selection in seconds via API calls. DiffAgent leverages a novel two-stage training framework SFTA enabling it to accurately align T2I API responses with user input in accordance with human preferences. To train and evaluate DiffAgent's capabilities we present DABench a comprehensive dataset encompassing an extensive range of T2I APIs from the community.

We start by introducing animatable 3D Gaussians to explicitly represent humans in various poses and clothing styles. Such an explicit and animatable representation can fuse 3D appearances more efficiently and consistently from 2D observations. Our representation is further augmented with dynamic properties to support pose-dependent appearance modeling where a dynamic appearance network along with an optimizable feature tensor is designed to learn the motion-to-appearance mapping. Moreover by leveraging the differentiable motion condition our method enables a joint optimization of motions and appearances during avatar modeling which helps to tackle the long-standing issue of inaccurate motion estimation in monocular settings. The efficacy of GaussianAvatar is validated on both the public dataset and our collected dataset demonstrating its superior performances in terms of appearance quality and rendering efficiency.,True,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Wei_Stronger_Fewer__Superior_Harnessing_Vision_Foundation_Models_for_Domain_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
CVPR-2024-2321,CVPR,2024,iKUN: Speak to Trackers without Retraining,"Yunhao Du, Cheng Lei, Zhicheng Zhao, Fei Su",Referring multi-object tracking (RMOT) aims to track multiple objects based on input textual descriptions. Previous works realize it by simply integrating an extra textual module into the multi-object tracker. However they typically need to retrain the entire framework and have difficulties in optimization. In this work we propose an insertable Knowledge Unification Network termed iKUN to enable communication with off-the-shelf trackers in a plug-and-play manner. Concretely a knowledge unification module (KUM) is designed to adaptively extract visual features based on textual guidance. Meanwhile to improve the localization accuracy we present a neural version of Kalman filter (NKF) to dynamically adjust process noise and observation noise based on the current motion status. Moreover to address the problem of open-set long-tail distribution of textual descriptions a test-time similarity calibration method is proposed to refine the confidence score with pseudo frequency.

Despite the practical successes achieved the outstanding performance of most virtual staining methods relies on hard-to-obtain paired images in training. In this paper we propose a method for virtual immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining named confusion-GAN which does not require paired images and can achieve comparable performance to supervised algorithms. Specifically we propose a multi-branch discriminator which judges if the features of generated images can be embedded into the feature pool of target domain images to improve the visual quality of generated images. Meanwhile we also propose a novel patch-level pathology information extractor which is assisted by multiple instance learning to ensure pathological consistency during virtual staining. Extensive experiments were conducted on three types of IHC images including a high-resolution hepatocellular carcinoma immunohistochemical dataset proposed by us. The results demonstrated that our proposed confusion-GAN can generate highly realistic images that are capable of deceiving even experienced pathologists.

Existing works either utilize aligned RGB and event data for accurate tracking or directly learn an event-based tracker. The former incurs higher inference costs while the latter may be susceptible to the impact of noisy events or sparse spatial resolution. In this paper we propose a novel hierarchical knowledge distillation framework that can fully utilize multi-modal / multi-view information during training to facilitate knowledge transfer enabling us to achieve high-speed and low-latency visual tracking during testing by using only event signals. Specifically a teacher Transformer-based multi-modal tracking framework is first trained by feeding the RGB frame and event stream simultaneously. Then we design a new hierarchical knowledge distillation strategy which includes pairwise similarity feature representation and response maps-based knowledge distillation to guide the learning of the student Transformer network. In particular since existing event-based tracking datasets are all low-resolution (346 * 260) we propose the first large-scale high-resolution (1280 * 720) dataset named EventVOT. It contains 1141 videos and covers a wide range of categories such as pedestrians vehicles UAVs ping pong etc. Extensive experiments on both low-resolution (FE240hz VisEvent COESOT) and our newly proposed high-resolution EventVOT dataset fully validated the effectiveness of our proposed method.

Towards this end we develop VidOSC a holistic learning approach that: (1) leverages text and vision-language models for supervisory signals to obviate manually labeling OSC training data and (2) abstracts fine-grained shared state representations from objects to enhance generalization. Furthermore we present HowToChange the first open-world benchmark for video OSC localization which offers an order of magnitude increase in the label space and annotation volume compared to the best existing benchmark.

Motivated by this we introduce Dataset Distillation via Disentangled Diffusion Model (D^4M) an efficient framework for dataset distillation. Compared to architecture-dependent methods D^4M employs latent diffusion model to guarantee consistency and incorporates label information into category prototypes.

It models the directional relationships between relation terms and corresponding objects within the input prompts. Specifically we optimize the HGCN on a pair of prompts with identical relational words but reversed object orders supplemented by a few reference images. The lightweight HGCN adjusts the text embeddings generated by the text encoder ensuring accurate reflection of the textual relation in the embedding space. Crucially our method retains the parameters of the text encoder and diffusion model preserving the model's robust performance on unrelated descriptions. We validated our approach on a newly curated dataset of diverse relational data demonstrating both quantitative and qualitative enhancements in generating images with precise visual relations.

Anomaly detection (AD) methods serve as robust tools for this purpose. However existing public datasets primarily consist of images without anomalies limiting the practical application of AD methods in production settings. To address this challenge we present (1) the Valeo Anomaly Dataset (VAD) a novel real-world industrial dataset comprising 5000 images including 2000 instances of challenging real defects across more than 20 subclasses. Acknowledging that traditional AD methods struggle with this dataset we introduce (2) Segmentation-based Anomaly Detector (SegAD). First SegAD leverages anomaly maps as well as segmentation maps to compute local statistics. Next SegAD uses these statistics and an optional supervised classifier score as input features for a Boosted Random Forest (BRF) classifier yielding the final anomaly score. Our SegAD achieves state-of-the-art performance on both VAD (+2.1% AUROC) and the VisA dataset (+0.4% AUROC).

We propose PlotSnap a dataset featuring two crime thriller TV shows with rich recaps and long episodes of 40 minutes. Story summarization labels are unlocked by matching recap shots to corresponding sub-stories in the episode. We propose a hierarchical model TaleSumm that processes entire episodes by creating compact shot and dialog representations and predicts importance scores for each video shot and dialog utterance by enabling interactions between local story groups. Unlike traditional summarization our method extracts multiple plot points from long videos. We present a thorough evaluation on story summarization including promising cross-series generalization.

CVPR-2024-2419,CVPR,2024,Part-aware Unified Representation of Language and Skeleton for Zero-shot Action Recognition,"Anqi Zhu, Qiuhong Ke, Mingming Gong, James Bailey",While remarkable progress has been made on supervised skeleton-based action recognition the challenge of zero-shot recognition remains relatively unexplored. In this paper we argue that relying solely on aligning label-level semantics and global skeleton features is insufficient to effectively transfer locally consistent visual knowledge from seen to unseen classes. To address this limitation we introduce Part-aware Unified Representation between Language and Skeleton (PURLS) to explore visual-semantic alignment at both local and global scales. PURLS introduces a new prompting module and a novel partitioning module to generate aligned textual and visual representations across different levels. The former leverages a pre-trained GPT-3 to infer refined descriptions of the global and local (body-part-based and temporal-interval-based) movements from the original action labels. The latter employs an adaptive sampling strategy to group visual features from all body joint movements that are semantically relevant to a given description. Our approach is evaluated on various skeleton/language backbones and three large-scale datasets i.e. NTU-RGB+D 60 NTU-RGB+D 120 and a newly curated dataset Kinetics-skeleton 200. The results showcase the universality and superior performance of PURLS surpassing prior skeleton-based solutions and standard baselines from other domains.

A motion compensation module is leveraged to overcome the feature deformation. A patch matching module based on bi-polarity hypergraph modeling is proposed to robustly estimate the feature spatial position.

However effectively identifying forged regions remains an open challenge. The high acquisition cost and the severe scarcity of high-quality data are major factors hindering the performance improvement of modern image manipulation localization systems. To address this issue we propose a novel paradigm termed as CAAA to automatically and accurately annotate the manually forged images from the web at the pixel-level. We further propose a novel metric termed as QES to assist in filtering out unreliable annotations. With CAAA and QES we construct a large-scale diverse and high-quality dataset comprising 123150 manually forged images with mask annotations.

Recently many methods and datasets have been proposed to tackle the grasp detection problem. However most of them do not consider using natural language as a condition to detect the grasp poses. In this paper we introduce Grasp-Anything++ a new language-driven grasp detection dataset featuring 1M samples over 3M objects and upwards of 10M grasping instructions. We utilize foundation models to create a large-scale scene corpus with corresponding images and grasp prompts. We approach the language-driven grasp detection task as a conditional generation problem. Drawing on the success of diffusion models in generative tasks and given that language plays a vital role in this task we propose a new language-driven grasp detection method based on diffusion models. Our key contribution is the contrastive training objective which explicitly contributes to the denoising process to detect the grasp pose given the language instructions. We illustrate that our approach is theoretically supportive. The intensive experiments show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches and allows real-world robotic grasping.

In this work we propose the task of weakly-supervised Narration-based Video Object Segmentation (NVOS). Given an egocentric video clip and a narration of the wearer's activities our aim is to segment object instances mentioned in the narration without using any spatial annotations during training. Existing weakly-supervised video object grounding methods typically yield bounding boxes for referred objects. In contrast we propose ROSA a weakly-supervised pixel-level grounding framework learning alignments between referred objects and segmentation mask proposals. Our model harnesses vision-language models pre-trained on image-text pairs to embed region masks and object phrases. During training we combine (a) a video-narration contrastive loss that implicitly supervises the alignment between regions and phrases and (b) a region-phrase contrastive loss based on inferred latent alignments. To address the lack of annotated NVOS datasets in egocentric videos we create a new evaluation benchmark VISOR-NVOS leveraging existing annotations of segmentation masks from VISOR alongside 14.6k newly-collected object-based video clip narrations. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot pixel-level grounding performance compared to strong baselines under similar supervision.

However existing video reasoning benchmarks are still inadequate since they were mainly designed for factual or situated reasoning and rarely involve broader knowledge in the real world. Our work aims to delve deeper into reasoning evaluations specifically within dynamic open-world and structured context knowledge. We propose a new benchmark (SOK-Bench) consisting of 44K questions and 10K situations with instance-level annotations depicted in the videos. The reasoning process is required to understand and apply situated knowledge and general knowledge for problem-solving. To create such a dataset we propose an automatic and scalable generation method to generate question-answer pairs knowledge graphs and rationales by instructing the combinations of LLMs and MLLMs. Concretely we first extract observable situated entities relations and processes from videos for situated knowledge and then extend to open-world knowledge beyond the visible content. The task generation is facilitated through multiple dialogues as iterations and subsequently corrected and refined by our designed self-promptings and demonstrations. With a corpus of both explicit situated facts and implicit commonsense we generate associated question-answer pairs and reasoning processes finally followed by manual reviews for quality assurance. We evaluated recent mainstream large vision language models on the benchmark and found several insightful conclusions.

Previous datasets and methods for classic RES task heavily rely on the prior assumption that one expression must refer to object-level targets. In this paper we take a step further to finer-grained part-level RES task. To promote the object-level RES task towards finer-grained vision-language understanding we put forward a new multi-granularity referring expression segmentation (MRES) task and construct an evaluation benchmark called RefCOCOm by manual annotations. By employing our automatic model-assisted data engine we build the largest visual grounding dataset namely MRES-32M which comprises over 32.2M high-quality masks and captions on the provided 1M images. Besides a simple yet strong model named UniRES is designed to accomplish the unified object-level and part-level grounding task. Extensive experiments on our RefCOCOm for MRES and three datasets (i.e. RefCOCO(+/g)) for classic RES task demonstrate the superiority of our method over previous state-of-the-art methods.

CVPR-2024-2465,CVPR,2024,Mind The Edge: Refining Depth Edges in Sparsely-Supervised Monocular Depth Estimation,"Lior Talker, Aviad Cohen, Erez Yosef, Alexandra Dana, Michael Dinerstein",Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) is a fundamental problem in computer vision with numerous applications. Recently LIDAR-supervised methods have achieved remarkable per-pixel depth accuracy in outdoor scenes. However significant errors are typically found in the proximity of depth discontinuities i.e. depth edges which often hinder the performance of depth-dependent applications that are sensitive to such inaccuracies e.g. novel view synthesis and augmented reality. Since direct supervision for the location of depth edges is typically unavailable in sparse LIDAR-based scenes encouraging the MDE model to produce correct depth edges is not straightforward. To the best of our knowledge this paper is the first attempt to address the depth edges issue for LIDAR-supervised scenes. In this work we propose to learn to detect the location of depth edges from densely-supervised synthetic data and use it to generate supervision for the depth edges in the MDE training. To quantitatively evaluate our approach and due to the lack of depth edges GT in LIDAR-based scenes we manually annotated subsets of the KITTI and the DDAD datasets with depth edges ground truth. We demonstrate significant gains in the accuracy of the depth edges with comparable per-pixel depth accuracy on several challenging datasets.

To fulfill the requirements we introduce Alpha-CLIP an enhanced version of CLIP with an auxiliary alpha channel to suggest attentive regions and fine-tuned with constructed millions of RGBA region-text pairs. Alpha-CLIP not only preserves the visual recognition ability of CLIP but also enables precise control over the emphasis of image contents.

Display photometric stereo which employs a conventional monitor as an illumination source has the potential to overcome limitations often encountered in bulky and difficult-to-use conventional setups. In this paper we present differentiable display photometric stereo (DDPS) addressing an often overlooked challenge in display photometric stereo: the design of display patterns. Departing from using heuristic display patterns DDPS learns the display patterns that yield accurate normal reconstruction for a target system in an end-to-end manner. To this end we propose a differentiable framework that couples basis-illumination image formation with analytic photometric-stereo reconstruction. The differentiable framework facilitates the effective learning of display patterns via auto-differentiation. Also for training supervision we propose to use 3D printing for creating a real-world training dataset enabling accurate reconstruction on the target real-world setup. Finally we exploit that conventional LCD monitors emit polarized light which allows for the optical separation of diffuse and specular reflections when combined with a polarization camera leading to accurate normal reconstruction. Extensive evaluation of DDPS shows improved normal-reconstruction accuracy compared to heuristic patterns and demonstrates compelling properties such as robustness to pattern initialization calibration errors and simplifications in image formation and reconstruction.,True,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Zhang_Transcending_the_Limit_of_Local_Window_Advanced_Super-Resolution_Transformer_with_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf

CVPR-2024-2482,CVPR,2024,Text2HOI: Text-guided 3D Motion Generation for Hand-Object Interaction,"Junuk Cha, Jihyeon Kim, Jae Shin Yoon, Seungryul Baek",This paper introduces the first text-guided work for generating the sequence of hand-object interaction in 3D. The main challenge arises from the lack of labeled data where existing ground-truth datasets are nowhere near generalizable in interaction type and object category which inhibits the modeling of diverse 3D hand-object interaction with the correct physical implication (e.g. contacts and semantics) from text prompts. To address this challenge we propose to decompose the interaction generation task into two subtasks: hand-object contact generation; and hand-object motion generation. For contact generation a VAE-based network takes as input a text and an object mesh and generates the probability of contacts between the surfaces of hands and the object during the interaction. The network learns a variety of local geometry structure of diverse objects that is independent of the objects' category and thus it is applicable to general objects. For motion generation a Transformer-based diffusion model utilizes this 3D contact map as a strong prior for generating physically plausible hand-object motion as a function of text prompts by learning from the augmented labeled dataset; where we annotate text labels from many existing 3D hand and object motion data. Finally we further introduce a hand refiner module that minimizes the distance between the object surface and hand joints to improve the temporal stability of the object-hand contacts and to suppress the penetration artifacts. In the experiments we demonstrate that our method can generate more realistic and diverse interactions compared to other baseline methods. We also show that our method is applicable to unseen objects. We will release our model and newly labeled data as a strong foundation for future research.

Self-Supervised Spatio-Temporal Grounding in Untrimmed Multi-Action Videos from Narrated Instructions,"Brian Chen, Nina Shvetsova, Andrew Rouditchenko, Daniel Kondermann, Samuel Thomas, Shih-Fu Chang, Rogerio Feris, James Glass, Hilde Kuehne",Spatio-temporal grounding describes the task of localizing events in space and time e.g. in video data based on verbal descriptions only.

To this end we combine local representation learning which focuses on leveraging fine-grained spatial information with a global representation encoding that captures higher-level representations and incorporates both in a joint approach. To evaluate this challenging task in a real-life setting a new benchmark dataset is proposed providing dense spatio-temporal grounding annotations in long untrimmed multi-action instructional videos for over 5K events.

However this challenging problem requires accurate modeling of the contact between hands and objects.To capture grasps existing methods use skeletons meshes or parametric models that does not represent hand shape accurately resulting in inaccurate contacts. We present MANUS a method for Markerless Hand-Object Grasp Capture using Articulated 3D Gaussians. We build a novel articulated 3D Gaussians representation that extends 3D Gaussian splatting for high-fidelity representation of articulating hands. Since our representation uses Gaussian primitives optimized from the multi-view pixel-aligned losses it enables us to efficiently and accurately estimate contacts between the hand and the object. For the most accurate results our method requires tens of camera views that current datasets do not provide. We therefore build MANUS-Grasps a new dataset that contains hand-object grasps viewed from 50+ cameras across 30+ scenes 3 subjects and comprising over 7M frames.

Unlike less-interacted motions closely interacted motions contain frequently occurring inter-human occlusions which pose significant challenges to existing capturing algorithms. To address this problem our key observation is that close physical interactions between two subjects typically happen under very specific situations (e.g. handshake hug etc.) and such situational contexts contain strong prior semantics to help infer the poses of occluded joints. In this spirit we introduce reaction priors which are invertible neural networks that bi-directionally model the pose probability distributions of one person given the pose of the other. The learned reaction priors are then incorporated into a query-based pose estimator which is a decoder-only Transformer with self-attentions on both intra-joint and inter-joint relationships. We demonstrate that our design achieves considerably higher performance than previous methods on multiple benchmarks. What's more as existing datasets lack sufficient cases of close human-human interactions we also build a new dataset called Dual-Human to better evaluate different methods. Dual-Human contains around 2k sequences of closely interacted two-person motions each with synthetic multi-view renderings contact annotations and text descriptions.

Feder Cooper, Jasmine Collins, Landan Seguin, Austin Jacobson, Mihir Patel, Jonathan Frankle, Cory Stephenson, Volodymyr Kuleshov",We train a set of open text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models on a dataset of curated Creative-Commons-licensed (CC) images which yields models that are competitive with Stable Diffusion 2 (SD2). This task presents two challenges: (1) high-resolution CC images lack the captions necessary to train T2I models; (2) CC images are relatively scarce. To address these challenges we use an intuitive transfer learning technique to produce a set of high-quality synthetic captions paired with our assembled CC images. We then develop a data- and compute-efficient training recipe that requires as little as 3% of the LAION data (i.e. roughly 70 million examples) needed to train existing SD2 models but obtains the same quality. These results indicate that we have a sufficient number of CC images (also roughly 70 million) for training high-quality models. Our recipe also implements a variety of optimizations that achieve 2.71x training speed-ups enabling rapid model iteration. We leverage this recipe to train several high-quality T2I mod- els which we dub the CommonCanvas family. Our largest model achieves comparable performance to SD2 on human evaluation even though we use a synthetically captioned CC-image dataset that is only <3% the size of LAION for training.

CVPR-2024-2590,CVPR,2024,Efficient Dataset Distillation via Minimax Diffusion,"Jianyang Gu, Saeed Vahidian, Vyacheslav Kungurtsev, Haonan Wang, Wei Jiang, Yang You, Yiran Chen",Dataset distillation reduces the storage and computational consumption of training a network by generating a small surrogate dataset that encapsulates rich information of the original large-scale one. However previous distillation methods heavily rely on the sample-wise iterative optimization scheme. As the images-per-class (IPC) setting or image resolution grows larger the necessary computation will demand overwhelming time and resources. In this work we intend to incorporate generative diffusion techniques for computing the surrogate dataset. Observing that key factors for constructing an effective surrogate dataset are representativeness and diversity we design additional minimax criteria in the generative training to enhance these facets for the generated images of diffusion models. We present a theoretical model of the process as hierarchical diffusion control demonstrating the flexibility of the diffusion process to target these criteria without jeopardizing the faithfulness of the sample to the desired distribution. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art validation performance while demanding much less computational resources. Under the 100-IPC setting on ImageWoof our method requires less than one-twentieth the distillation time of previous methods yet yields even better performance.

We study a visual common sense task that requires understanding 'what is not visible'. Specifically given an image (e.g. of a living room) and a name of an object (""cushion"") a vision system is asked to predict semantically-meaningful regions (masks or bounding boxes) in the image where that object could be placed or is likely be placed by humans (e.g. on the sofa). We call this task: Semantic Placement (SP) and believe that such common-sense visual understanding is critical for assitive robots (tidying a house) AR devices (automatically rendering an object in the user's space) and visually-grounded chatbots with common sense. Studying the invisible is hard. Datasets for image description are typically constructed by curating relevant images (e.g. via image search with object names) and asking humans to annotate the contents of the image; neither of those two steps are straightforward for objects not present in the image. We overcome this challenge by operating in the opposite direction: we start with an image of an object in context (which is easy to find online) and remove that object from the image via inpainting. This automated pipeline converts unstructured web data into a paired with/without object dataset. With this proposed data generation pipeline we collect a novel dataset containing  1.3M images across 9 object categories. We then train a SP prediction model called CLIP-UNet on our dataset. The CLIP-UNet outperforms existing VLMs and baselines that combine semantic priors with object detectors generalizes well to real-world and simulated images exhibits semantics-aware reasoning for object placement and enables downstream applications like tidying robots in indoor environments.",True,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Guo_Vanishing-Point-Guided_Video_Semantic_Segmentation_of_Driving_Scenes_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf

Prior state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods only focus on the reconstruction of the visible areas in a scene neglecting the invisible areas due to the occlusions e.g. the contact surface between furniture occluded wall and floor. Our method tackles the task of completing the occluded scene surfaces resulting in a complete 3D scene mesh. The core idea of our method is learning 3D geometry prior from various complete scenes to infer the occluded geometry of an unseen scene from solely depth measurements. We design a coarse-fine hierarchical octree representation coupled with a dual-decoder architecture i.e. Geo-decoder and 3D Inpainter which jointly reconstructs the complete 3D scene geometry. The Geo-decoder with detailed representation at fine levels is optimized online for each scene to reconstruct visible surfaces. The 3D Inpainter with abstract representation at coarse levels is trained offline using various scenes to complete occluded surfaces. As a result while the Geo-decoder is specialized for an individual scene the 3D Inpainter can be generally applied across different scenes. We evaluate the proposed method on the 3D Completed Room Scene (3D-CRS) and iTHOR datasets significantly outperforming the SOTA methods by a gain of 16.8% and 24.2% in terms of the completeness of 3D reconstruction. 3D-CRS dataset including a complete 3D mesh of each scene is provided at project webpage.,True,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Lin_VastGaussian_Vast_3D_Gaussians_for_Large_Scene_Reconstruction_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
CVPR-2024-2604,CVPR,2024,ExACT: Language-guided Conceptual Reasoning and Uncertainty Estimation for Event-based Action Recognition and More,"Jiazhou Zhou, Xu Zheng, Yuanhuiyi Lyu, Lin Wang",Event cameras have recently been shown beneficial for practical vision tasks such as action recognition thanks to their high temporal resolution power efficiency and reduced privacy concerns. However current research is hindered by 1) the difficulty in processing events because of their prolonged duration and dynamic actions with complex and ambiguous semantics and 2) the redundant action depiction of the event frame representation with fixed stacks. We find language naturally conveys abundant semantic information rendering it stunningly superior in reducing semantic uncertainty. In light of this we propose ExACT a novel approach that for the first time tackles event-based action recognition from a cross-modal conceptualizing perspective. Our ExACT brings two technical contributions. Firstly we propose an adaptive fine-grained event (AFE) representation to adaptively filter out the repeated events for the stationary objects while preserving dynamic ones. This subtly enhances the performance of ExACT without extra computational cost. Then we propose a conceptual reasoning-based uncertainty estimation module which simulates the recognition process to enrich the semantic representation. In particular conceptual reasoning builds the temporal relation based on the action semantics and uncertainty estimation tackles the semantic uncertainty of actions based on the distributional representation. Experiments show that our ExACT achieves superior recognition accuracy of 94.83%(+2.23%) 90.10%(+37.47%) and 67.24% on PAF HARDVS and our SeAct datasets respectively.,True,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Kahatapitiya_VicTR_Video-conditioned_Text_Representations_for_Activity_Recognition_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf

However existing research typically focuses on limited tasks and often omits key multi-view and temporal information which is crucial for robust autonomous driving. To bridge these gaps we introduce NuInstruct a novel dataset with 91K multi-view video-QA pairs across 17 subtasks where each task demands holistic information (e.g. temporal multi-view and spatial) significantly elevating the challenge level. To obtain NuInstruct we propose a novel SQL-based method to generate instruction-response pairs automatically which is inspired by the driving logical progression of humans. We further present BEV-InMLLM an end-to-end method for efficiently deriving instruction-aware Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) features language-aligned for large language models. BEV-InMLLM integrates multi-view spatial awareness and temporal semantics to enhance MLLMs' capabilities on NuInstruct tasks. Moreover our proposed BEV injection module is a plug-and-play method for existing MLLMs. Our experiments on NuInstruct demonstrate that BEV-InMLLM significantly outperforms existing MLLMs e.g 9% improvement on various tasks.

CVPR-2024-2622,CVPR,2024,ChatScene: Knowledge-Enabled Safety-Critical Scenario Generation for Autonomous Vehicles,"Jiawei Zhang, Chejian Xu, Bo Li",We present ChatScene a Large Language Model (LLM)-based agent that leverages the capabilities of LLMs to generate safety-critical scenarios for autonomous vehicles. Given unstructured language instructions the agent first generates textually described traffic scenarios using LLMs. These scenario descriptions are subsequently broken down into several sub-descriptions for specified details such as behaviors and locations of vehicles. The agent then distinctively transforms the textually described sub-scenarios into domain-specific languages which then generate actual code for prediction and control in simulators facilitating the creation of diverse and complex scenarios within the CARLA simulation environment. A key part of our agent is a comprehensive knowledge retrieval component which efficiently translates specific textual descriptions into corresponding domain-specific code snippets by training a knowledge database containing the scenario description and code pairs. Extensive experimental results underscore the efficacy of ChatScene in improving the safety of autonomous vehicles. For instance the scenarios generated by ChatScene show a 15% increase in collision rates compared to state-of-the-art baselines when tested against different reinforcement learning-based ego vehicles. Furthermore we show that by using our generated safety-critical scenarios to fine-tune different RL-based autonomous driving models they can achieve a 9% reduction in collision rates surpassing current SOTA methods. ChatScene effectively bridges the gap between textual descriptions of traffic scenarios and practical CARLA simulations providing a unified way to conveniently generate safety-critical scenarios for safety testing and improvement for AVs.,True,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Chen_VideoLLM-online_Online_Video_Large_Language_Model_for_Streaming_Video_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf

However general instance segmentation frameworks are incompetent due to 1) the subtle differences between some teeth' shapes (e.g. maxillary first premolar and second premolar) 2) the teeth's position and shape variation across subjects and 3) the presence of abnormalities in the dentition (e.g. caries and edentulism). To address these problems we propose a ViT-based framework named TeethSEG which consists of stacked Multi-Scale Aggregation (MSA) blocks and an Anthropic Prior Knowledge (APK) layer. Specifically to compose the two modules we design 1) a unique permutation-based upscaler to ensure high efficiency while establishing clear segmentation boundaries with 2) multi-head self/cross-gating layers to emphasize particular semantics meanwhile maintaining the divergence between token embeddings. Besides we collect 3) the first open-sourced intraoral image dataset IO150K which comprises over 150k intraoral photos and all photos are annotated by orthodontists using a human-machine hybrid algorithm. Experiments on IO150K demonstrate that our TeethSEG outperforms the state-of-the-art segmentation models on dental image segmentation.,True,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Pei_VideoMAC_Video_Masked_Autoencoders_Meet_ConvNets_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf

The drastic difference between first-person (egocentric) and third-person (exocentric) camera views makes this a challenging task.

To facilitate research in this direction we also present TF2023 a novel dataset comprising synchronized first-person and third-person views along with masks of camera wearers and labels associating these masks with the respective first-person views. In addition we propose a novel quantitative metric designed to measure a model's ability to comprehend the relationship between the two views.

Philip Chen",Templates serve as a good starting point to implement a design (e.g. banner slide) but it takes great effort from designers to manually create. In this paper we present Desigen an automatic template creation pipeline which generates background images as well as harmonious layout elements over the background. Different from natural images a background image should preserve enough non-salient space for the overlaying layout elements. To equip existing advanced diffusion-based models with stronger spatial control we propose two simple but effective techniques to constrain the saliency distribution and reduce the attention weight in desired regions during the background generation process. Then conditioned on the background we synthesize the layout with a Transformer-based autoregressive generator. To achieve a more harmonious composition we propose an iterative inference strategy to adjust the synthesized background and layout in multiple rounds. We constructed a design dataset with more than 40k advertisement banners to verify our approach. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed pipeline generates high-quality templates comparable to human designers. More than a single-page design we further show an application of presentation generation that outputs a set of theme-consistent slides.

Existing methods focus on complex interactivities while leveraging a simple relationship model. These methods however struggle with a diversity of appearance situation position interaction and relation in videos. This limitation hinders the ability to fully comprehend the interplay within the complex visual dynamics of subjects. In this paper we delve into interactivities understanding within visual content by deriving scene graph representations from dense interactivities among humans and objects. To achieve this goal we first present a new dataset containing Appearance-Situation-Position-Interaction-Relation predicates named ASPIRe offering an extensive collection of videos marked by a wide range of interactivities.

CVPR-2024-2648,CVPR,2024,CityDreamer: Compositional Generative Model of Unbounded 3D Cities,"Haozhe Xie, Zhaoxi Chen, Fangzhou Hong, Ziwei Liu",3D city generation is a desirable yet challenging task since humans are more sensitive to structural distortions in urban environments. Additionally generating 3D cities is more complex than 3D natural scenes since buildings as objects of the same class exhibit a wider range of appearances compared to the relatively consistent appearance of objects like trees in natural scenes. To address these challenges we propose CityDreamer a compositional generative model designed specifically for unbounded 3D cities. Our key insight is that 3D city generation should be a composition of different types of neural fields: 1) various building instances and 2) background stuff such as roads and green lands. Specifically we adopt the bird's eye view scene representation and employ a volumetric render for both instance-oriented and stuff-oriented neural fields. The generative hash grid and periodic positional embedding are tailored as scene parameterization to suit the distinct characteristics of building instances and background stuff. Furthermore we contribute a suite of CityGen Datasets including OSM and GoogleEarth which comprises a vast amount of real-world city imagery to enhance the realism of the generated 3D cities both in their layouts and appearances.

CVPR-2024-2659,CVPR,2024,From a Bird's Eye View to See: Joint Camera and Subject Registration without the Camera Calibration,"Zekun Qian, Ruize Han, Wei Feng, Song Wang",We tackle a new problem of multi-view camera and subject registration in the bird's eye view (BEV) without pre-given camera calibration which promotes the multi-view subject registration problem to a new calibration-free stage. This greatly alleviates the limitation in many practical applications. However this is a very challenging problem since its only input is several RGB images from different first-person views (FPVs) without the BEV image and the calibration of the FPVs while the output is a unified plane aggregated from all views with the positions and orientations of both the subjects and cameras in a BEV. For this purpose we propose an end-to-end framework solving camera and subject registration together by taking advantage of their mutual dependence whose main idea is as below: i) creating a subject view-transform module (VTM) to project each pedestrian from FPV to a virtual BEV ii) deriving a multi-view geometry-based spatial alignment module (SAM) to estimate the relative camera pose in a unified BEV iii) selecting and refining the subject and camera registration results within the unified BEV.

While promising animating these personalized images with realistic motions poses significant challenges in preserving distinct styles high-fidelity details and achieving motion controllability by text. In this paper we present PIA a Personalized Image Animator that excels in aligning with condition images achieving motion controllability by text and the compatibility with various personalized T2I models without specific tuning. To achieve these goals PIA builds upon a base T2I model with well-trained temporal alignment layers allowing for the seamless transformation of any personalized T2I model into an image animation model. A key component of PIA is the introduction of the condition module which takes as inputs the condition frame and inter-frame affinity. This module leverages the affinity hint to transfer appearance information from the condition frame to individual frames in the latent space. This design mitigates the challenges of appearance-related frame alignment within PIA and allows for a stronger focus on aligning with motion-related guidance.

However current research is prohibitively restricted by the lack of large-scale real-world and spatial-temporally aligned event-image datasets. To this end we propose a real-world (indoor and outdoor) dataset comprising over 30K pairs of images and events under both low and normal illumination conditions. To achieve this we utilize a robotic arm that traces a consistent non-linear trajectory to curate the dataset with spatial alignment precision under 0.03mm. We then introduce a matching alignment strategy rendering 90% of our dataset with errors less than 0.01s. Based on the dataset we propose a novel event-guided LIE approach called EvLight towards robust performance in real-world low-light scenes. Specifically we first design the multi-scale holistic fusion branch to extract holistic structural and textural information from both events and images. To ensure robustness against variations in the regional illumination and noise we then introduce a Signal-to-Noise-Ratio (SNR)-guided regional feature selection to selectively fuse features of images from regions with high SNR and enhance those with low SNR by extracting regional structural information from events. our EvLight significantly surpasses the frame-based methods e.g. Retinexformer by 1.14 dB and 2.62 dB respectively.

Unlike current general-purpose foundation models that are stuck in the dilemma of inferior quality and text-image misalignment for humans CosmicMan enables generating photo-realistic human images with meticulous appearance reasonable structure and precise text-image alignment with detailed dense descriptions. At the heart of CosmicMan's success are the new reflections and perspectives on data and models: (1) We found that data quality and a scalable data production flow are essential for the final results from trained models. Hence we propose a new data production paradigm Annotate Anyone which serves as a perpetual data flywheel to produce high-quality data with accurate yet cost-effective annotations over time. Based on this we constructed a large-scale dataset CosmicMan-HQ 1.0 with 6 Million high-quality real-world human images in a mean resolution of 1488x1255 and attached with precise text annotations deriving from 115 Million attributes in diverse granularities. (2) We argue that a text-to-image foundation model specialized for humans must be pragmatic - easy to integrate into down-streaming tasks while effective in producing high-quality human images. Hence we propose to model the relationship between dense text descriptions and image pixels in a decomposed manner and present Decomposed-Attention-Refocusing (Daring) training framework. It seamlessly decomposes the cross-attention features in existing text-to-image diffusion model and enforces attention refocusing without adding extra modules. Through Daring we show that explicitly discretizing continuous text space into several basic groups that align with human body structure is the key to tackling the misalignment problem in a breeze.

While this may appear to be a reasonable approach we demonstrate that doing so does not correlate to human preference when the estimated lighting is used to relight a virtual scene into a real photograph. To study this we design a controlled psychophysical experiment where human observers must choose their preference amongst rendered scenes lit using a set of lighting estimation algorithms selected from the recent literature and use it to analyse how these algorithms perform according to human perception. Then we demonstrate that none of the most popular IQA metrics from the literature taken individually correctly represent human perception. Finally we show that by learning a combination of existing IQA metrics we can more accurately represent human preference.

In some practical scenarios emphasizing local differences is crucial for accurately identifying a correct match thereby enhancing the overall robustness and reliability of the matching process. Commonly used shape descriptors have several limitations and often fail to provide meaningful local insights about the paired geometries. In this work we propose a new technique based on graph Laplacian eigenmaps to match point clouds by taking into account fine local structures. To deal with the order and sign ambiguity of Laplacian eigenmaps we introduce a new operator called Coupled Laplacian that allows to easily generate aligned eigenspaces for multiple registered geometries. We show that the similarity between those aligned high-dimensional spaces provides a locally meaningful score to match shapes. We firstly evaluate the performance of the proposed technique in a point-wise manner focusing on the task of object anomaly localization on the MVTec 3D-AD dataset. Additionally we define a new medical task called automatic Bone Side Estimation (BSE) which we address through a global similarity score derived from coupled eigenspaces.

CVPR-2024-2693,CVPR,2024,Continuous Optical Zooming: A Benchmark for Arbitrary-Scale Image Super-Resolution in Real World,"Huiyuan Fu, Fei Peng, Xianwei Li, Yejun Li, Xin Wang, Huadong Ma",Most current arbitrary-scale image super-resolution (SR) methods has commonly relied on simulated data generated by simple synthetic degradation models (e.g. bicubic downsampling) at continuous various scales thereby falling short in capturing the complex degradation of real-world images. This limitation hinders the visual quality of these methods when applied to real-world images. To address this issue we propose the Continuous Optical Zooming dataset (COZ) by constructing an automatic imaging system to collect images at fine-grained various focal lengths within a specific range and providing strict image pair alignment. The COZ dataset serves as a benchmark to provide real-world data for training and testing arbitrary-scale SR models. To enhance the model's robustness against real-world image degradation we propose a Local Mix Implicit network (LMI) based on the MLP-mixer architecture and meta-learning which directly learns the local texture information by simultaneously mixing features and coordinates of multiple independent points. The extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the arbitrary-scale SR models trained on the COZ dataset compared to models trained on simulated data. Our LMI model exhibits the superior effectiveness compared to other models. This study is of great significance in developing more efficient algorithms and improving the performance of arbitrary-scale image SR methods in practical applications.

However existing video summarization datasets are notably limited in their size constraining the effectiveness of state-of-the-art methods for generalization. Our work aims to overcome this limitation by capitalizing on the abundance of long-form videos with dense speech-to-video alignment and the remarkable capabilities of recent large language models (LLMs) in summarizing long text. We introduce an automated and scalable pipeline for generating a large-scale video summarization dataset using LLMs as Oracle summarizers. By leveraging the generated dataset we analyze the limitations of existing approaches and propose a new video summarization model that effectively addresses them. To facilitate further research in the field our work also presents a new benchmark dataset that contains 1200 long videos each with high-quality summaries annotated by professionals.

However, the best RGBD trackers are extensions of the state-of-the-art deep RGB trackers. They are trained with RGB data and the depth channel is used as a sidekick for subtleties such as occlusion detection. This can be explained by the fact that there are no sufficiently large RGBD datasets to 1) train ""deep depth trackers"" and to 2) challenge RGB trackers with sequences for which the depth cue is essential. This work introduces a new RGBD tracking dataset - DepthTrack - that has twice as many sequences (200) and scene types (40) than in the largest existing dataset, and three times more objects (90). In addition, the average length of the sequences (1473), the number of deformable objects (16) and the number of annotated tracking attributes (15) have been increased. Furthermore, by running the SotA RGB and RGBD trackers on DepthTrack, we propose a new RGBD tracking baseline, namely DeT, which reveals that deep RGBD tracking indeed benefits from genuine training data.

The XVFI-Net is based on a recursive multi-scale shared structure that consists of two cascaded modules for bidirectional optical flow learning between two input frames (BiOF-I) and for bidirectional optical flow learning from target to input frames (BiOF-T). The optical flows are stably approximated by a complementary flow reversal (CFR) proposed in BiOF-T module. During inference, the BiOF-I module can start at any scale of input while the BiOF-T module only operates at the original input scale so that the inference can be accelerated while maintaining highly accurate VFI performance. Extensive experimental results show that our XVFI-Net can successfully capture the essential information of objects with extremely large motions and complex textures while the state-of-the-art methods exhibit poor performance. Furthermore, our XVFI-Net framework also performs comparably on the previous lower resolution benchmark dataset, which shows a robustness of our algorithm as well.

Marks, Alan Sullivan","In this paper, we present InSeGAN an unsupervised 3D generative adversarial network (GAN) for segmenting (nearly) identical instances of rigid objects in depth images. Using an analysis-by-synthesis approach, we design a novel GAN architecture to synthesize a multiple-instance depth image with independent control over each instance. InSeGAN takes in a set of code vectors (e.g., random noise vectors), each encoding the 3D pose of an object that is represented by a learned implicit object template. The generator has two distinct modules. The first module, the instance feature generator, uses each encoded pose to transform the implicit template into a feature map representation of each object instance. The second module, the depth image renderer, aggregates all of the single-instance feature maps output by the first module and generates a multiple-instance depth image. A discriminator distinguishes the generated multiple-instance depth images from the distribution of true depth images. To use our model for instance segmentation, we propose an instance pose encoder that learns to take in a generated depth image and reproduce the pose code vectors for all of the object instances. To evaluate our approach, we introduce a new synthetic dataset, ""Insta-10,"" consisting of 100,000 depth images each with 5 instances of an object from one of 10 classes. Our experiments on Insta-10, as well as on real-world noisy depth images, show that InSeGAN achieves state-of-the-art performance, often outperforming prior methods by large margins.",True,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/papers/Huang_ARAPReg_An_As-Rigid-As_Possible_Regularization_Loss_for_Learning_Deformable_Shape_ICCV_2021_paper.pdf

Events, on the other hand, have their unique challenges: rather than capturing static body postures, the event signals are best at capturing local motions. This leads us to propose a two-stage deep learning approach, called EventHPE. The first-stage, FlowNet, is trained by unsupervised learning to infer optical flow from events. Both events and optical flow are closely related to human body dynamics, which are fed as input to the ShapeNet in the second stage, to estimate 3D human shapes. To mitigate the discrepancy between image-based flow (optical flow) and shape-based flow (vertices movement of human body shape), a novel flow coherence loss is introduced by exploiting the fact that both flows are originated from the identical human motion. An in-house event-based 3D human dataset is curated that comes with 3D pose and shape annotations, which is by far the largest one to our knowledge.

As a result, it strongly depends on the quality of instantaneous observations, often failing when objects are not fully visible. In contrast, tracking in humans is underlined by the notion of object permanence: once an object is recognized, we are aware of its physical existence and can approximately localize it even under full occlusions. In this work, we introduce an end-to-end trainable approach for joint object detection and tracking that is capable of such reasoning. We build on top of the recent CenterTrack architecture, which takes pairs of frames as input, and extend it to videos of arbitrary length. To this end, we augment the model with a spatio-temporal, recurrent memory module, allowing it to reason about object locations and identities in the current frame using all the previous history. It is, however, not obvious how to train such an approach. We study this question on a new, large-scale, synthetic dataset for multi-object tracking, which provides ground truth annotations for invisible objects, and propose several approaches for supervising tracking behind occlusions.

A key difficulty lies in fact in the camera calibration phase. Existing state-of-the-art methods perform the calibration using image processing or keypoint detection techniques that require high-quality video streams, yet typical CCTV footage is low-resolution and noisy. As a result, these methods largely fail in real-world conditions. In contrast, we propose two novel calibration techniques whose only inputs come from an off-the-shelf object detector. Both methods consider multiple detections jointly, leveraging the fact that cars have similar and well-known 3D shapes with normalized dimensions. The first one is based on minimizing an energy function corresponding to a 3D reprojection error, the second one instead learns from synthetic training data to predict the scene geometry directly. Noticing the lack of speed estimation benchmarks faithfully reflecting the actual quality of surveillance cameras, we introduce a novel dataset collected from public CCTV streams. Experimental results conducted on three diverse benchmarks demonstrate excellent speed estimation accuracy that could enable the wide use of CCTV cameras for traffic analysis, even in challenging conditions where state-of-the-art methods completely fail.

Most Re-ID methods formulate it as visual representation learning and image search, and its accuracy is consequently affected greatly by the search space. Spatial-temporal information has been proven to be efficient to filter irrelevant negative samples and significantly improve Re-ID accuracy. However, existing spatial-temporal person Re-ID methods are still rough and do not exploit spatial-temporal information sufficiently. In this paper, we propose a novel instance-level and spatial-temporal disentangled Re-ID method (InSTD), to improve Re-ID accuracy.

Previous methods extract all potential matching pairs of pot sherds and considers them simultaneously to search for an optimal global pot configuration. In this work, we empirically show such global approach greatly suffers from false positive matches between sherds inflicted by indistinctive sharp fracture surfaces in pot fragments. To mitigate this problem, we take inspirations from the field of structure-from-motion (SfM), where many pipelines have matured in reconstructing a 3D scene from multiple images. Motivated by the success of the incremental approach in robust SfM, we present an efficient reassembly method for axially symmetric pots based on iterative registration of one sherd at a time.

Our method combines three neural networks: An encoder, a scoring network, and a decoder. The encoder extracts image features and predicts a neural activation map for each face looked at by a human observer. A neural scoring network compares the human and neural attention and predicts a relevance score for each extracted image feature. Finally, image features are aggregated into a single feature vector as a linear combination of all features weighted by relevance which a decoder decodes into the final photofit. We train the neural scoring network on a novel dataset containing gaze data of 19 participants looking at collages of synthetic faces. We show that our method significantly outperforms a mean baseline predictor and report on a human study that shows that we can decode photofits that are visually plausible and close to the observer's mental image.",True,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/papers/Wang_Causal_Attention_for_Unbiased_Visual_Recognition_ICCV_2021_paper.pdf
ICCV-2021-206,ICCV,2021,Improving Robustness of Facial Landmark Detection by Defending Against Adversarial Attacks,"Congcong Zhu, Xiaoqiang Li, Jide Li, Songmin Dai","Many recent developments in facial landmark detection have been driven by stacking model parameters or augmenting annotations. However, three subsequent challenges remain, including 1) an increase in computational overhead, 2) the risk of overfitting caused by increasing model parameters, and 3) the burden of labor-intensive annotation by humans. We argue that exploring the weaknesses of the detector so as to remedy them is a promising method of robust facial landmark detection. To achieve this, we propose a sample-adaptive adversarial training (SAAT) approach to interactively optimize an attacker and a detector, which improves facial landmark detection as a defense against sample-adaptive black-box attacks. By leveraging adversarial attacks, the proposed SAAT exploits adversarial perturbations beyond the handcrafted transformations to improve the detector. Specifically, an attacker generates adversarial perturbations to reflect the weakness of the detector. Then, the detector must improve its robustness to adversarial perturbations to defend against adversarial attacks. Moreover, a sample-adaptive weight is designed to balance the risks and benefits of augmenting adversarial examples to train the detector. We also introduce a masked face alignment dataset, Masked-300W, to evaluate our method. Experiments show that our SAAT performed comparably to existing state-of-the-art methods.

Unfortunately, existing OSDA methods always ignore the demand for the information of unseen categories and simply recognize them as ""unknown"" set without further explanation. This motivates us to understand the unknown categories more specifically by exploring the underlying structures and recovering their interpretable semantic attributes. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to accurately identify the seen categories in target domain, and effectively recover the semantic attributes for unseen categories. Specifically, structure preserving partial alignment is developed to recognize the seen categories through domain-invariant feature learning. Attribute propagation over visual graph is designed to smoothly transit attributes from seen to unseen categories via visual-semantic mapping.

By adapting principles from geometry processing and physical simulation to NeRF-like models, we propose an elastic regularization of the deformation field that further improves robustness. We show that our method can turn casually captured selfie photos/videos into deformable NeRF models that allow for photorealistic renderings of the subject from arbitrary viewpoints, which we dub ""nerfies.""

Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) occluded ReID models rely on some auxiliary modules, including pose estimation, feature pyramid and graph matching modules, to learn multi-scale and/or part-level features to tackle the occlusion challenges. This unfortunately leads to complex ReID models that (i) fail to generalize to challenging occlusions of diverse appearance, shape or size, and (ii) become ineffective in handling non-occluded pedestrians. However, real-world ReID applications typically have highly diverse occlusions and involve a hybrid of occluded and non-occluded pedestrians. To address these two issues, we introduce a novel ReID model that learns discriminative single-scale global-level pedestrian features by enforcing a novel exponentially sensitive yet bounded distance loss on occlusion-based augmented data. We show for the first time that learning single-scale global features without using these auxiliary modules is able to outperform those SOTA multi-scale and/or part-level feature-based models. Further, our simple model can achieve new SOTA performance in both occluded and non-occluded ReID, as shown by extensive results on three occluded and two general ReID benchmarks. Additionally, we create a large-scale occluded person ReID dataset with both indoor and outdoor occlusions in different scenes, which is significantly larger and contains substantially more diverse occlusions and pedestrian dressings than existing occluded ReID datasets, providing a more faithful occluded ReID benchmark.",True,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/papers/Fang_Compressing_Visual-Linguistic_Model_via_Knowledge_Distillation_ICCV_2021_paper.pdf

Solving this task for composite scenes (such as object stacks) is challenging: occluded areas are not only ambiguous in shape but also in instance segmentation; multiple decompositions could be valid. We observe that physics constrains decomposition as well as shape in occluded regions and hypothesise that a latent space learned from scenes built under physics simulation can serve as a prior to better predict shape and instances in occluded regions. To this end we propose SIMstack, a depth-conditioned Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE), trained on a dataset of objects stacked under physics simulation. We formulate instance segmentation as a center voting task which allows for class-agnostic detection and doesn't require setting the maximum number of objects in the scene. At test time, our model can generate 3D shape and instance segmentation from a single depth view, probabilistically sampling proposals for the occluded region from the learned latent space.

The principal contribution of this work is thus a large-scale dataset, called Common Objects in 3D, with real multi-view images of object categories annotated with camera poses and ground truth 3D point clouds. The dataset contains a total of 1.5 million frames from nearly 19,000 videos capturing objects from 50 MS-COCO categories and, as such, it is significantly larger than alternatives both in terms of the number of categories and objects.

In this literature, we propose a single image desnowing algorithm to address the diversity of snow particles in shape and size. First, to better represent the complex snow shape, we apply the dual-tree wavelet transform and propose a complex wavelet loss in the network. Second, we propose a hierarchical decomposition paradigm in our network for better understanding the different sizes of snow particles. Last, we propose a novel feature called the contradict channel (CC) for the snow scenes. We find that the regions containing the snow particles tend to have higher intensity in the CC than that in the snow-free regions. We leverage this discriminative feature to construct the contradict channel loss for improving the performance of snow removal. Moreover, due to the limitation of existing snow datasets, to simulate the snow scenarios comprehensively, we propose a large-scale dataset called Comprehensive Snow Dataset (CSD).

The key to resolve the OOD overconfidence issue inherently is to build a subset of OOD samples and then suppress predictions on them. This paper proposes the Chamfer OOD examples (CODEs), whose distribution is close to that of in-distribution samples, and thus could be utilized to alleviate the OOD overconfidence issue effectively by suppressing predictions on them. To obtain CODEs, we first generate seed OOD examples via slicing&splicing operations on in-distribution samples from different categories, and then feed them to the Chamfer generative adversarial network for distribution transformation, without accessing to any extra data. Training with suppressing predictions on CODEs is validated to alleviate the OOD overconfidence issue largely without hurting classification accuracy, and outperform the state-of-the-art methods.

The rich notion of context incorporates several aspects including physics rules, statistical co-occurrences, and relative object sizes, among others. While previous work has focused on crowd-sourced out-of-context photographs from the web to study scene context, controlling the nature and extent of contextual violations has been a daunting task. Here we introduce a diverse, synthetic Out-of-Context Dataset (OCD) with fine-grained control over scene context. By leveraging a 3D simulation engine, we systematically control the gravity, object co-occurrences and relative sizes across 36 object categories in a virtual household environment. We conducted a series of experiments to gain insights into the impact of contextual cues on both human and machine vision using OCD.

Since the videos are temporally synchronized and spatially overlapping, we can see a person from multiple views and associate their trajectory across cameras. In order to find the correct association between pedestrians visible from multiple views during the same time window, we extract a visual feature from a tracklet (sequence of pedestrian images) that encodes its similarity and dissimilarity to all other candidate tracklets. We propose a inter-tracklet (person to person) attention mechanism that learns a representation for a target tracklet while taking into account other tracklets across multiple views. Furthermore, to encode the gait and motion of a person, we introduce second intra-tracklet (person-specific) attention module with position embeddings. This second module employs a transformer encoder to learn a feature from a sequence of features over one tracklet.

These cases happen when a model exploits spurious statistical regularities to produce correct answers but does not actually deploy the desired behavior. There is a need to identify possible shortcuts in a dataset and assess their use before deploying a model in the real world. The research community in VQA has focused exclusively on question-based shortcuts, where a model might, for example, answer ""What is the color of the sky"" with ""blue"" by relying mostly on the question-conditional training prior and give little weight to visual evidence. We go a step further and consider multimodal shortcuts that involve both questions and images. We first identify potential shortcuts in the popular VQA v2 training set by mining trivial predictive rules such as co-occurrences of words and visual elements. We then introduce VQA-CounterExamples (VQA-CE), an evaluation protocol based on our subset of CounterExamples i.e. image-question-answer triplets where our rules lead to incorrect answers.

This is a challenging problem that goes far beyond the capabilities of current view synthesis methods, which quickly degenerate when presented with large camera motions. Methods for video generation also have limited ability to produce long sequences and are often agnostic to scene geometry. We take a hybrid approach that integrates both geometry and image synthesis in an iterative render, refine, and repeat framework, allowing for long-range generation that cover large distances after hundreds of frames. Our approach can be trained from a set of monocular video sequences. We propose a dataset of aerial footage of coastal scenes, and compare our method with recent view synthesis and conditional video generation baselines, showing that it can generate plausible scenes for much longer time horizons over large camera trajectories compared to existing methods.

However, large portions of online videos contain irrelevant audio-visual signals because of edited/overdubbed audio, and models trained on such uncurated videos have shown to learn suboptimal representations. Therefore, existing self-supervised approaches rely on datasets with predetermined taxonomies of semantic concepts, where there is a high chance of audio-visual correspondence. Unfortunately, constructing such datasets require labor intensive manual annotation and/or verification, which severely limits the utility of online videos for large-scale learning. In this work, we present an automatic dataset curation approach based on subset optimization where the objective is to maximize the mutual information between audio and visual channels in videos. We demonstrate that our approach finds videos with high audio-visual correspondence and show that self-supervised models trained on our data achieve competitive performances compared to models trained on existing manually curated datasets.

Additionally, we evaluate three detection models and show that natural perturbations induce both classification as well as localization errors, leading to a median drop in detection mAP of 14 points.

However, collecting large-scale real-world training data for face recognition has turned out to be challenging, especially due to the label noise and privacy issues. Meanwhile, existing face recognition datasets are usually collected from web images, lacking detailed annotations on attributes (e.g., pose and expression), so the influences of different attributes on face recognition have been poorly investigated. In this paper, we address the above-mentioned issues in face recognition using synthetic face images, i.e., SynFace. Specifically, we first explore the performance gap between recent state-of-the-art face recognition models trained with synthetic and real face images. We then analyze the underlying causes behind the performance gap, e.g., the poor intra-class variations and the domain gap between synthetic and real face images. Inspired by this, we devise the SynFace with identity mixup (IM) and domain mixup (DM) to mitigate the above performance gap, demonstrating the great potentials of synthetic data for face recognition. Furthermore, with the controllable face synthesis model, we can easily manage different factors of synthetic face generation, including pose, expression, illumination, the number of identities, and samples per identity.

Lau","Salient object detection identifies objects in an image that grab visual attention. Although contextual features are considered in recent literature, they often fail in real-world complex scenarios. We observe that this is mainly due to two issues: First, most existing datasets consist of simple foregrounds and backgrounds that hardly represent real-life scenarios. Second, current methods only learn contextual features of salient objects, which are insufficient to model high-level semantics for saliency reasoning in complex scenes. To address these problems, we first construct a new large-scale dataset with complex scenes in this paper. We then propose a context-aware learning approach to explicitly exploit the semantic scene contexts. Specifically, two modules are proposed to achieve the goal: 1) a Semantic Scene Context Refinement module to enhance contextual features learned from salient objects with scene context, and 2) a Contextual Instance Transformer to learn contextual relations between objects and scene context. To our knowledge, such high-level semantic contextual information of image scenes is under-explored for saliency detection in the literature.

Their solutions may face new difficulties in both object detection and interaction classification due to the increasing diversity of objects (e.g., 1000 categories). Different from previous methods, we formulate the HOI detection as a query problem. We propose a unified model to jointly discover the target objects and predict the corresponding interactions based on the human queries, thereby eliminating the need of using generic object detectors, extra steps to associate human-object instances, and multi-stream interaction recognition.

Such simple synthetic degradation models, however, cannot well describe the complex degradation processes in real-world videos, and thus the trained VSR models become ineffective in real-world applications. As an attempt to bridge the gap, we build a real-world video super-resolution (RealVSR) dataset by capturing paired LR-HR video sequences using the multi-camera system of iPhone 11 Pro Max. Since the LR-HR video pairs are captured by two separate cameras, there are inevitably certain misalignment and luminance/color differences between them. To more robustly train the VSR model and recover more details from the LR inputs, we convert the LR-HR videos into YCbCr space and decompose the luminance channel into a Laplacian pyramid, and then apply different loss functions to different components. Experiments validate that VSR models trained on our RealVSR dataset demonstrate better visual quality than those trained on synthetic datasets under real-world settings.

The task of identifying the main speaker (who is properly taking his/her turn of speaking) and the interrupters (who are interrupting or reacting to the main speaker's utterances) remains a challenging task.

Firstly, a direct association of Audio and Visual features may limit the correlations to be extracted due to different modalities. Secondly, the relationship across temporal segments helping to maintain the consistency of localization, separation and conversation contexts is not effectively exploited. Finally, the interactions between speakers that usually contain the tracking and anticipatory decisions about transition to a new speaker is usually ignored.

However, state of the art face antispoofing systems are still vulnerable to novel types of attacks that are never seen during training. Moreover, even if such attacks are correctly detected, these systems lack the ability to adapt to newly encountered attacks. The post-training ability of continually detecting new types of attacks and self-adaptation to identify these attack types, after the initial detection phase, is highly appealing. In this paper, we enable a deep neural network to detect anomalies in the observed input data points as potential new types of attacks by suppressing the confidence-level of the network outside the training samples' distribution. We then use experience replay to update the model to incorporate knowledge about new types of attacks without forgetting the past learned attack types. Experimental results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on the OULU and Idiap datasets as well as a newly introduced dataset, all of which exhibit a variety of attack types.",True,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/papers/Guo_Image_Inpainting_via_Conditional_Texture_and_Structure_Dual_Generation_ICCV_2021_paper.pdf

But what are the right correspondences? The task of visual correspondence is well defined for two different images of same object instance. In case of two images of objects belonging to same category, visual correspondence is reasonably well-defined in most cases. But what about correspondence between two objects of completely different category -- e.g., a shoe and a bottle? Does there exist any correspondence? Inspired by humans' ability to: (a) generalize beyond semantic categories and; (b) infer functional affordances, we introduce the problem of functional correspondences in this paper. Given images of two objects, we ask a simple question: what is the set of correspondences between these two images for a given task? For example, what are the correspondences between a bottle and shoe for the task of pounding or the task of pouring. We introduce a new dataset: FunKPoint that has ground truth correspondences for 10 tasks and 20 object categories. We also introduce a modular task-driven representation for attacking this problem and demonstrate that our learned representation is effective for this task. But most importantly, because our supervision signal is not bound by semantics, we show that our learned representation can generalize better on few-shot classification problem. We hope this paper will inspire our community to think beyond semantics and focus more on cross-category generalization and learning representations for robotics tasks.",True,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/papers/Wang_Image_Synthesis_via_Semantic_Composition_ICCV_2021_paper.pdf

Different from previous methods considering the visual and linguistic information in two separate structures, we propose a Visual Language Modeling Network (VisionLAN), which views the visual and linguistic information as a union by directly enduing the vision model with language capability. Specially, we introduce the text recognition of character-wise occluded feature maps in the training stage. Such operation guides the vision model to use not only the visual texture of characters, but also the linguistic information in visual context for recognition when the visual cues are confused (e.g. occlusion, noise, etc.). As the linguistic information is acquired along with visual features without the need of extra language model, VisionLAN significantly improves the speed by 39% and adaptively considers the linguistic information to enhance the visual features for accurate recognition. Furthermore, an Occlusion Scene Text (OST) dataset is proposed to evaluate the performance on the case of missing character-wise visual cues.

Previous approaches are built on top of image matting models, which fail in maintaining the temporal coherence when being adapted to videos. They either utilize the optical flow to smooth frame-wise prediction, where the performance is dependent on the selected optical flow model; or naively combine feature maps from multiple frames, which does not model well the correspondence of pixels in adjacent frames. In this paper, we propose to enhance the temporal coherence by Consistency-Regularized Graph Neural Networks (CRGNN) with the aid of a synthesized video matting dataset. CRGNN utilizes Graph Neural Networks (GNN) to relate adjacent frames such that pixels or regions that are incorrectly predicted in one frame can be corrected by leveraging information from its neighboring frames. To generalize our model from synthesized videos to real-world videos, we propose a consistency regularization technique to enforce the consistency on the alpha and foreground when blending them with different backgrounds. To evaluate the efficacy of CRGNN, we further collect a real-world dataset with annotated alpha mattes.

While great progress has been made in detecting generic or individual types of edges, it remains under-explored to comprehensively study all four edge types together. In this paper, we propose a novel neural network solution, RINDNet, to jointly detect all four types of edges. Taking into consideration the distinct attributes of each type of edges and the relationship between them, RINDNet learns effective representations for each of them and works in three stages. In stage I, RINDNet uses a common backbone to extract features shared by all edges. Then in stage II it branches to prepare discriminative features for each edge type by the corresponding decoder. In stage III, an independent decision head for each type aggregates the features from previous stages to predict the initial results. Additionally, an attention module learns attention maps for all types to capture the underlying relations between them, and these maps are combined with initial results to generate the final edge detection results. For training and evaluation, we construct the first public benchmark, BSDS-RIND, with all four types of edges carefully annotated. In our experiments, RINDNet yields promising results in comparison with state-of-the-art methods.

With 70,000 V100 GPU hours of training, we benchmark these methods on 4K and 8K resolution images under seven different settings to provide a set of baseline models. Moreover, we propose a baseline model, called Mesh Attention Network (MANet) for SISR.

The proposed approach can effectively and adaptively combine meaningful information from both domains. Our approach's effectiveness is enforced by a novel designed cross-domain attention schemes, which can effectively enhance features based on self- and cross-domain attention schemes; The adaptiveness is guarded by a specially designed weighting scheme, which can adaptively balance the contribution of the two domains.

We identify that the long-tail distribution of visual concepts and unequal importance of reasoning steps in real data are the two key obstacles that limit the models' real-world potentials. To address these challenges, we propose a new paradigm, Calibrating Concepts and Operations (CCO), which enables neural symbolic models to capture underlying data characteristics and to reason with hierarchical importance. Specifically, we introduce an executor with learnable concept embedding magnitudes for handling distribution imbalance, and an operation calibrator for highlighting important operations and suppressing redundant ones.

However, these benchmarks unfortunately introduce some unwanted and impractical goals, e.g., to perfectly distinguish CIFAR dogs from ImageNet dogs, even though they have the same semantics and negligible covariate shifts. These unrealistic goals will result in an extremely narrow range of model capabilities, greatly limiting their use in real applications. To overcome these drawbacks, we re-design the benchmarks and propose the semantically coherent out-of-distribution detection (SC-OOD). On the SC-OOD benchmarks, existing methods suffer from large performance degradation, suggesting that they are extremely sensitive to low-level discrepancy between data sources while ignoring their inherent semantics. To develop an effective SC-OOD detection approach, we leverage an external un- labeled set and design a concise framework featured by unsupervised dual grouping (UDG) for the joint modeling of ID and OOD data. The proposed UDG can not only enrich the semantic knowledge of the model by exploiting unlabeled data in an unsupervised manner but also distinguish ID/OOD samples to enhance ID classification and OOD detection tasks simultaneously.

Differing from the perspective camera model (pin-hole model) that is commonly used for close-range and aerial cameras, the cubic rational polynomial camera (RPC) model is the mainstream model for push-broom linear-array satellite cameras. However, the homography warping used in the prevailing learning based MVS methods is only applicable to pin-hole cameras. In order to apply the SOTA learning based MVS technology to the satellite MVS taskfor large-scale Earth surface reconstruction, RPC warping should be considered. In this work, we propose, for the first time, a rigorous RPC warping module. The rational polynomial coefficients are recorded as a tensor, and the RPC warping is formulated as a series of tensor transformations. Based on the RPC warping, we propose the deep learning based satellite MVS (SatMVS) framework for large-scale and wide depth range Earth surface reconstruction. We also introduce a large-scale satellite image dataset consisting of 519 5120x5120 images, which we call the TLC SatMVS dataset. The satellite images were acquired from a three-line camera (TLC) that catches triple-view images simultaneously, forming a valuable supplement to the existing open-source WorldView-3 datasets with single-scanline images.

However, existing works are incapable to deliver a continuous and fine-grained editing mode (e.g., editing a slightly smiling face to a big laughing one) with natural interactions with users. In this work, we propose Talk-to-Edit, an interactive facial editing framework that performs fine-grained attribute manipulation through dialog between the user and the system. Our key insight is to model a continual """"semantic field"""" in the GAN latent space. 1) Unlike previous works that regard the editing as traversing straight lines in the latent space, here the fine-grained editing is formulated as finding a curving trajectory that respects fine-grained attribute landscape on the semantic field. 2) The curvature at each step is location-specific and determined by the input image as well as the users' language requests. 3) To engage the users in a meaningful dialog, our system generates language feedback by considering both the user request and the current state of the semantic field. We also contribute CelebA-Dialog, a visual-language facial editing dataset to facilitate large-scale study. Specifically, each image has manually annotated fine-grained attribute annotations as well as template-based textual descriptions in natural language. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate the superiority of our framework in terms of 1) the smoothness of fine-grained editing, 2) the identity/attribute preservation, and 3) the visual photorealism and dialog fluency.

The proposed algorithm mainly consists of a semi-supervised learning part and a knowledge distillation part. The semi-supervised part estimates the rain map and reconstructs the derained image based on the well-established layer separation principle. To facilitate rain removal, we develop a rain direction regularizer to constrain the rain estimation network in the semi-supervised learning part. With the estimated rain maps from the semi-supervised learning part, we first synthesize a new paired set by adding to rain-free images based on the superimposition model. The real rainy images and the derained results constitute another paired set. Then we develop an effective knowledge distillation method to explore such two paired sets so that the deraining model in the semi-supervised learning part is distilled. We propose two new rainy datasets, named RainDirection and Real3000, to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Previous methods are either subject to single-modal input or perform supervised image-level product retrieval, thus fail to accommodate real-life scenarios where enormous weakly annotated multi-modal data are present. In this paper, we investigate a more realistic setting that aims to perform weakly-supervised multi-modal instance-level product retrieval among fine-grained product categories. To promote the study of this challenging task, we contribute Product1M, one of the largest multi-modal cosmetic datasets for real-world instance-level retrieval. Notably, Product1M contains over 1 million image-caption pairs and consists of two sample types, i.e., single-product and multi-product samples, which encompass a wide variety of cosmetics brands. In addition to the great diversity, Product1M enjoys several appealing characteristics including fine-grained categories, complex combinations, and fuzzy correspondence that well mimic the real-world scenes. Moreover, we propose a novel model named Cross-modal contrAstive Product Transformer for instance-level prodUct REtrieval (CAPTURE), that excels in capturing the potential synergy between multi-modal inputs via a hybrid-stream transformer in a self-supervised manner. CAPTURE generates discriminative instance features via masked multi-modal learning as well as cross-modal contrastive pretraining and it outperforms several SOTA cross-modal baselines.

We propose a Hierarchical Dance Video Recognition framework (HDVR). HDVR estimates 2D pose sequences, tracks dancers, and then simultaneously estimates corresponding 3D poses and 3D-to-2D imaging parameters, without requiring ground truth for 3D poses. Unlike most methods that work on a single person, our tracking works on multiple dancers, under occlusions. From the estimated 3D pose sequence, HDVR extracts body part movements, and therefrom dance genre. The resulting hierarchical dance representation is explainable to experts. To overcome noise and interframe correspondence ambiguities, we enforce spatial and temporal motion smoothness and photometric continuity over time. We use an LSTM network to extract 3D movement subsequences from which we recognize dance genre. For experiments, we have identified 154 movement types, of 16 body parts, and assembled a new University of Illinois Dance (UID) Dataset, containing 1143 video clips of 9 genres covering 30 hours, annotated with movement and genre labels.

In this paper, we propose a video restoration method to automatically remove these contaminants and produce a clean video. Our approach first seeks to detect attention maps that indicate the regions that need to be restored. In order to leverage the corresponding clean pixels from adjacent frames, we propose a flow completion module to hallucinate the flow of the background scene to the attention regions degraded by the contaminants. Guided by the attention maps and completed flows, we propose a recurrent technique to restore the input frame by fetching clean pixels from adjacent frames. Finally, a multi-frame processing stage is used to further process the entire video sequence in order to enforce temporal consistency. The entire network is trained on a synthetic dataset that approximates the physical lighting properties of contaminant artifacts.

Most of the previous methods rarely solve the cases that the prohibited items are deliberately hidden in messy objects due to the lack of large-scale datasets, restricted their applications in real-world scenarios. Towards real-world prohibited item detection, we collect a large-scale dataset, named as PIDray, which covers various cases in real-world scenarios for prohibited item detection, especially for deliberately hidden items. With an intensive amount of effort, our dataset contains 12 categories of prohibited items in 47,677 X-ray images with high-quality annotated segmentation masks and bounding boxes.

Meanwhile, we design the selective dense attention network (SDANet) to construct a strong baseline, which consists of the dense attention module and the dependency refinement module. The dense attention module formed by the spatial and channel-wise dense attentions, is designed to learn the discriminative features to boost the performance.

This is known as shortcut learning and leads to impaired generalization. In this work, we show that common DNNs also suffer from shortcut learning when predicting only basic visual object factors of variation (FoV) such as shape, color, or texture. We argue that besides shortcut opportunities, generalization opportunities (GO) are also an inherent part of real-world vision data and arise from partial independence between predicted classes and FoVs. We also argue that it is necessary for DNNs to exploit GO to overcome shortcut learning. Our core contribution is to introduce the Diagnostic Vision Benchmark suite DiagViB-6, which includes datasets and metrics to study a network's shortcut vulnerability and generalization capability for six independent FoV.

We parse the problem into three steps. First, the text in all frames is normalized to a frontal pose using a spatio-temporal transformer network. Second, the text is replaced in a single reference frame using a state-of-art still-image text replacement method. Finally, the new text is transferred from the reference to remaining frames using a novel learned image transformation network that captures lighting and blur effects in a temporally consistent manner.

We argue that this stems from the way data is collected. Designing and collecting static datasets of images (or videos) locks us in to specific design choices and limits us to post-hoc analyses. In practice, vision datasets only include specific domains and tasks. This not only makes it necessary and difficult to combine datsets, but leads to scattershot overall coverage that frustrates systemic research into the interaction of tasks, data, models, and learning algorithms. For example, if a model trained for ImageNet classification on ImageNet transfers better to CoCo than does a model trained for Kitti depth estimation--is that due to the difference in tasks or the different training data? We note that one way to do this is to use a comprehensive, standardized scene representation that contains extra information about the scene, and then to use that to create a specific dataset of study. We introduce a platform for doing this. Specifically, we provide a pipeline that takes as input a 3D scans and generates multi-task datasets of mid-level cues. The pipeline exposes complete control over the generation process, is implemented in mostly python, and we provide ecosystem tools such as a Docker and PyTorch dataloaders. We also provide a starter dataset of several recent 3D scan datasets, processed into standard static datasets of mid-level cues. We show that this starter dataset (generated from the annotator pipeline) is reliable; it yields models that provide state-of-the-art performance for several tasks. It yields human-level surface normal estimation performance on OASIS, despite having never seen OASIS data during training. With the proliferation of cheaper 3D sensors (e.g. on the newest iPhone), we anticipate that releasing an automated tool for this processing pipeline will allow the starter set to continue to expand and cover more domains.

Kim","Imaging depth and spectrum have been extensively studied in isolation from each other for decades. Recently, hyperspectral-depth (HS-D) imaging emerges to capture both information simultaneously by combining two different imaging systems; one for depth, the other for spectrum. While being accurate, this combinational approach induces increased form factor, cost, capture time, and alignment/registration problems. In this work, departing from the combinational principle, we propose a compact single-shot monocular HS-D imaging method. Our method uses a diffractive optical element (DOE), the point spread function of which changes with respect to both depth and spectrum. This enables us to reconstruct spectrum and depth from a single captured image. To this end, we develop a differentiable simulator and a neural-network-based reconstruction method that are jointly optimized via automatic differentiation. To facilitate learning the DOE, we present a first HS-D dataset by building a benchtop HS-D imager that acquires high-quality ground truth.

One intriguing phenomenon regarding untargeted UAP is that most images are misclassified to a dominant label. This phenomenon has been reported in previous works while lacking a justified explanation, for which our work attempts to provide an alternative explanation. For a more practical universal attack, our investigation of untargeted UAP focuses on alleviating the dependence on the original training samples, from removing the need for sample labels to limiting the sample size. Towards strictly data-free untargeted UAP, our work proposes to exploit artificial Jigsaw images as the training samples, demonstrating competitive performance. We further investigate the possibility of exploiting the UAP for a data-free black-box attack which is arguably the most practical yet challenging threat model.

It is a challenging set-up since one faces not only the domain gap between the labeled source set and the unlabeled target set, but also the distribution shifts existing within the latter among the different target domains.

To this end, we propose LOKI (LOng term and Key Intentions), a novel large-scale dataset that is designed to tackle joint trajectory and intention prediction for heterogeneous traffic agents (pedestrians and vehicles) in an autonomous driving setting.

The RGB-D SLAM approach relies heavily on the accuracy of the input depth map. However, refraction and reflection of transparent objects will result in false depth input of RGB-D cameras, which makes the traditional RGB-D SLAM algorithm unable to work correctly in the presence of transparent objects. In this paper, we propose a novel SLAM approach called transfusion that allows transparent object existence and recovery in the video input. Our method is composed of two parts. Transparent Objects Cut Iterative Closest Points (TC-ICP)is first used to recover camera pose, detecting and removing transparent objects from input to reduce the trajectory errors. Then Transparent Objects Reconstruction (TO-Reconstruction) is used to reconstruct the transparent objects and opaque objects separately. The opaque objects are reconstructed with the traditional method, and the transparent objects are reconstructed with the visual hull-based method. To evaluate our algorithm, we construct a new RGB-D SLAM database containing 25 video sequences. Each sequence has at least one transparent object.

With recent road extraction methods showing high accuracy, we argue that it is time to transition to the more practical map update task, where an existing map is updated by adding, removing, and shifting roads, without introducing errors in parts of the existing map that remain up-to-date. In this paper, we develop a new dataset called MUNO21 for the map update task, and show that it poses several new and interesting research challenges.

Hamsici, Steven Feng, Prachee Sharma, Thorsten Gernoth","We consider the problem of online and real-time registration of partial point clouds obtained from an unseen real-world rigid object without knowing its 3D model. The point cloud is partial as it is obtained by a depth sensor capturing only the visible part of the object from a certain viewpoint. It introduces two main challenges: 1) two partial point clouds do not fully overlap and 2) keypoints tend to be less reliable when the visible part of the object does not have salient local structures. To address these issues, we propose DeepPRO, a keypoint-free and an end-to-end trainable deep neural network. Its core idea is inspired by how humans align two point clouds: we can imagine how two point clouds will look like after the registration based on their shape. To realize the idea, DeepPRO has inputs of two partial point clouds and directly predicts the point-wise location of the aligned point cloud. By preserving the ordering of points during the prediction, we enjoy dense correspondences between input and predicted point clouds when inferring rigid transform parameters.

However, the popular DensePose-COCO dataset relies on a sophisticated manual annotation system, leading to severe limitations in acquiring the denser and more accurate annotated pose resources. In this work, we introduce a new 3D human-body model with a series of decoupled parameters that could freely control the generation of the body. Furthermore, we build a data generation system based on this decoupling 3D model, and construct an ultra dense synthetic benchmark UltraPose, containing around 1.3 billion corresponding points. Compared to the existing manually annotated DensePose-COCO dataset, the synthetic UltraPose has ultra dense image-to-surface correspondences without annotation cost and error. Our proposed UltraPose provides the largest benchmark and data resources for lifting the model capability in predicting more accurate dense poses. To promote future researches in this field, we also propose a transformer-based method to model the dense correspondence between 2D and 3D worlds.

Nonetheless, the choice of unseen concepts for such an evaluation is usually made arbitrarily, and independently from the seen concepts used to train representations, thus ignoring any semantic relationships between the two. In this paper, we argue that the semantic relationships between seen and unseen concepts affect generalization performance and propose ImageNet-CoG, a novel benchmark on the ImageNet-21K (IN-21K) dataset that enables measuring concept generalization in a principled way. Our benchmark leverages expert knowledge that comes from WordNet in order to define a sequence of unseen IN-21K concept sets that are semantically more and more distant from the ImageNet-1K (IN-1K) subset, a ubiquitous training set.

To minimize ambiguities in action classification, HAA500 consists of highly diversified classes of fine-grained atomic actions, where only consistent actions fall under the same label, e.g., """"Baseball Pitching"""" vs """"Free Throw in Basketball"""". Thus HAA500 is different from existing atomic action datasets, where coarse-grained atomic actions were labeled with coarse action-verbs such as """"Throw"""". HAA500 has been carefully curated to capture the precise movement of human figures with little class-irrelevant motions or spatio-temporal label noises. The advantages of HAA500 are fourfold: 1) human-centric actions with a high average of 69.7% detectable joints for the relevant human poses; 2) high scalability since adding a new class can be done under 20-60 minutes; 3) curated videos capturing essential elements of an atomic action without irrelevant frames; 4) fine-grained atomic action classes.

One potential reason for this unexpected result is that all losses let the network focus on similar image regions or properties. In this paper, we investigate this by conducting a two-step analysis to extract and compare the learned visual features of the same model architecture trained with different loss functions: First, we compare the learned features on the pixel level by correlating saliency maps of the same input images. Second, we compare the clustering of embeddings for several image properties, e.g. object color or illumination. To provide independent control over these properties, photo-realistic 3D car renders similar to images in the Cars196 dataset are generated. In our analysis, we compare 14 pretrained models from a recent study and find that, even though all models perform similarly, different loss functions can guide the model to learn different features.

These approaches often ignore the visual context of these sound sources or avoid modeling object interactions that may be useful to better characterize the sources, especially when the same object class may produce varied sounds from distinct interactions. To address this challenging problem, we propose Audio Visual Scene Graph Segmenter (AVSGS), a novel deep learning model that embeds the visual structure of the scene as a graph and segments this graph into subgraphs, each subgraph being associated with a unique sound obtained by co-segmenting the audio spectrogram. At its core, AVSGS uses a recursive neural network that emits mutually-orthogonal sub-graph embeddings of the visual graph using multi-head attention. These embeddings are used for conditioning an audio encoder-decoder towards source separation. Our pipeline is trained end-to-end via a self-supervised task consisting of separating audio sources using the visual graph from artificially mixed sounds.

Yet, almost all of them generate discrete shape representations, such as voxels, point clouds, and polygon meshes. We present the first 3D generative model for a drastically different shape representation --- describing a shape as a sequence of computer-aided design (CAD) operations. Unlike meshes and point clouds, CAD models encode the user creation process of 3D shapes, widely used in numerous industrial and engineering design tasks. However, the sequential and irregular structure of CAD operations poses significant challenges for existing 3D generative models. Drawing an analogy between CAD operations and natural language, we propose a CAD generative network based on the Transformer. We demonstrate the performance of our model for both shape autoencoding and random shape generation. To train our network, we create a new CAD dataset consisting of 178,238 models and their CAD construction sequences.

An effective attention-aware module is designed to obtain the fine-grained geometry details from multi-view images, where high-fidelity results can be generated. In addition to the spatial attention method, for video inputs, we further propose a novel temporal fusion method to alleviate the noise and temporal inconsistencies for moving character reconstruction.

The proposed AIST++ dataset contains 1.1M frames of 3D dance motion in 1408 sequences, covering 10 dance genres with multi-view videos with known camera poses---the largest dataset of this kind to our knowledge. We show that naively applying sequence models such as transformers to this dataset for the task of music conditioned 3D motion generation does not produce satisfactory 3D motion that is well correlated with the input music. We overcome these shortcomings by introducing key changes in its architecture design and supervision: FACT model involves a deep cross-modal transformer block with full-attention that is trained to predict N future motions. We empirically show that these changes are key factors in generating long sequences of realistic dance motion that are well-attuned to the input music.

Barron","When a camera is pointed at a strong light source, the resulting photograph may contain lens flare artifacts. Flares appear in a wide variety of patterns (halos, streaks, color bleeding, haze, etc.) and this diversity in appearance makes flare removal challenging. Existing analytical solutions make strong assumptions about the artifact's geometry or brightness, and therefore only work well on a small subset of flares. Machine learning techniques have shown success in removing other types of artifacts, like reflections, but have not been widely applied to flare removal due to the lack of training data. To solve this problem, we explicitly model the optical causes of flare either empirically or using wave optics, and generate semi-synthetic pairs of flare-corrupted and clean images. This enables us to train neural networks to remove lens flare for the first time. Experiments show our data synthesis approach is critical for accurate flare removal, and that models trained with our technique generalize well to real lens flares across different scenes, lighting conditions, and cameras.",True,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/papers/He_TransReID_Transformer-Based_Object_Re-Identification_ICCV_2021_paper.pdf

Gaze Following in 360-Degree Images,"Yunhao Li, Wei Shen, Zhongpai Gao, Yucheng Zhu, Guangtao Zhai, Guodong Guo","Gaze following, i.e., detecting the gaze target of a human subject, in 2D images has become an active topic in computer vision. However, it usually suffers from the out of frame issue due to the limited field-of-view (FoV) of 2D images. In this paper, we introduce a novel task, gaze following in 360-degree images which provide an omnidirectional FoV and can alleviate the out of frame issue. We collect the first dataset, ""GazeFollow360"", for this task, containing around 10,000 360-degree images with complex gaze behaviors under various scenes. Existing 2D gaze following methods suffer from performance degradation in 360-degree images since they may use the assumption that a gaze target is in the 2D gaze sight line. However, this assumption is no longer true for long-distance gaze behaviors in 360-degree images, due to the distortion brought by sphere-to-plane projection. To address this challenge, we propose a 3D sight line guided dual-pathway framework, to detect the gaze target within a local region (here) and from a distant region (there), parallelly. Specifically, the local region is obtained as a 2D cone-shaped field along the 2D projection of the sight line starting at the human subject's head position, and the distant region is obtained by searching along the sight line in 3D sphere space. Finally, the location of the gaze target is determined by fusing the estimations from both the local region and the distant region. Experimental results show that our method achieves significant improvements over previous 2D gaze following methods on our GazeFollow360 dataset.",True,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/papers/Deng_TransVG_End-to-End_Visual_Grounding_With_Transformers_ICCV_2021_paper.pdf

Images in our dataset are mostly captured with illuminants existing in the scene, and the ground truth illumination is computed by taking the difference between the images with different illumination combination. Therefore, our dataset captures natural composition in the real-world setting with wide field-of-view, providing more extensive dataset compared to existing datasets for multi-illumination white balance. As conventional single illuminant white balance algorithms cannot be directly applied, we also apply per-pixel DNN-based white balance algorithm and show its effectiveness against using patch-wise white balancing.

Therefore, recovering the complete point clouds from partial ones becomes an indispensable task in many practical applications. In this paper, we present a new method that reformulates point cloud completion as a set-to-set translation problem and design a new model, called PoinTr that adopts a transformer encoder-decoder architecture for point cloud completion. By representing the point cloud as a set of unordered groups of points with position embeddings, we convert the point cloud to a sequence of point proxies and employ the transformers for point cloud generation. To facilitate transformers to better leverage the inductive bias about 3D geometric structures of point clouds, we further devise a geometry-aware block that models the local geometric relationships explicitly. The migration of transformers enables our model to better learn structural knowledge and preserve detailed information for point cloud completion.

However, as flares may appear in a variety of shapes, positions, and colors, detecting and removing them entirely from an image is very challenging. Existing methods rely on predefined intensity and geometry priors of flares, and may fail to distinguish the difference between light sources and flare artifacts. We observe that the conditions of the light source in the image play an important role in the resulting flares. In this paper, we present a deep framework with light source aware guidance for single-image flare removal (SIFR). In particular, we first detect the light source regions and the flare regions separately, and then remove the flare artifacts based on the light source aware guidance. By learning the underlying relationships between the two types of regions, our approach can remove different kinds of flares from the image. In addition, instead of using paired training data which are difficult to collect, we propose the first unpaired flare removal dataset and new cycle-consistency constraints to obtain more diverse examples and avoid manual annotations.

We also propose a simple yet effective method, CLNeRF, which introduces continual learning (CL) to Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs). CLNeRF combines generative replay and the Instant Neural Graphics Primitives (NGP) architecture to effectively prevent catastrophic forgetting and efficiently update the model when new data arrives. We also add trainable appearance and geometry embeddings to NGP, allowing a single compact model to handle complex scene changes. Without the need to store historical images, CLNeRF trained sequentially over multiple scans of a changing scene performs on-par with the upper bound model trained on all scans at once. Compared to other CL baselines CLNeRF performs much better across standard benchmarks and WAT.

Prior models mostly assume that humans interact with rigid objects using only a few body parts, limiting their scope. In this paper, we address the challenging problem of Full-Body Articulated Human-Object Interaction (f-AHOI), wherein the whole human bodies interact with articulated objects, whose parts are connected by movable joints. We present Capturing Human and Articulated-object InteRactionS (CHAIRS), a large-scale motion-captured f-AHOI dataset, consisting of 17.3 hours of versatile interactions between 46 participants and 81 articulated and rigid sittable objects. CHAIRS provides 3D meshes of both humans and articulated objects during the entire interactive process, as well as realistic and physically plausible full-body interactions. We show the value of CHAIRS with object pose estimation. By learning the geometrical relationships in HOI, we devise the first model that leverages human pose estimation to tackle the articulated object pose/shape estimation during whole-body interactions. Given an image and an estimated human pose, our model reconstructs the object pose/shape and optimizes the reconstruction according to a learned interaction prior. Under two evaluation settings, our model significantly outperforms baselines. We further demonstrate the value of CHAIRS with a downstream task of generating interacting human poses conditioned on articulated objects.

 We propose OFVL-MS, a unified framework that dispenses with the traditional practice of training a model for each individual scene and relieves gradient conflict induced by optimizing multiple scenes collectively, enabling efficient storage yet precise visual localization for all scenes. Technically, in the forward pass of OFVL-MS, we design a layer-adaptive sharing policy with a learnable score for each layer to automatically determine whether the layer is shared or not. Such sharing policy empowers us to acquire task-shared parameters for a reduction of storage cost and task-specific parameters for learning scene-related features to alleviate gradient conflict. In the backward pass of OFVL-MS, we introduce a gradient normalization algorithm that homogenizes the gradient magnitude of the task-shared parameters so that all tasks converge at the same pace. Furthermore, a sparse penalty loss is applied on the learnable scores to facilitate parameter sharing for all tasks without performance degradation. We conduct comprehensive experiments on multiple benchmarks and our new released indoor dataset LIVL, showing that OFVL-MS families significantly outperform the state-of-the-arts with fewer parameters.

In real-world scenarios, however, a single image may not offer a good viewpoint, hindering fine-grained scene understanding. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel task called Embodied Captioning, which equips visual captioning models with navigation capabilities, enabling them to actively explore the scene and reduce visual ambiguity from suboptimal viewpoints. Specifically, starting at a random viewpoint, an agent must navigate the environment to gather information from different viewpoints and generate a comprehensive paragraph describing all objects in the scene.

We first extract multi-scale features for each image and adopt spatial 2D-3D attention to lift them to the 3D volume space. Then we apply 3D convolutions to progressively upsample the volume features and impose supervision on multiple levels.

To understand how these two perspectives affect overall subjective opinions in UGC-VQA, we conduct a large-scale subjective study to collect human quality opinions on overall quality of videos as well as perceptions from aesthetic and technical perspectives. The collected Disentangled Video Quality Database (DIVIDE-3k) confirms that human quality opinions on UGC videos are universally and inevitably affected by both aesthetic and technical perspectives.

However, in real-world scenarios, the number of input data and tasks is constantly changing in a statistical way, not a static way. Although recently introduced incremental learning scenarios having blurry task boundaries somewhat address the above issues, they still do not fully reflect the statistical properties of real-world situations because of the fixed ratio of disjoint and blurry samples. In this paper, we propose a new Stochastic incremental Blurry task boundary scenario, called Si-Blurry, which reflects the stochastic properties of the real-world. We find that there are two major challenges in the Si-Blurry scenario: (1) inter- and intra-task forgettings and (2) class imbalance problem. To alleviate them, we introduce Mask and Visual Prompt tuning (MVP). In MVP, to address the inter- and intra-task forgetting issues, we propose a novel instance-wise logit masking and contrastive visual prompt tuning loss. Both of them help our model discern the classes to be learned in the current batch. It results in consolidating the previous knowledge. In addition, to alleviate the class imbalance problem, we introduce a new gradient similarity-based focal loss and adaptive feature scaling to ease overfitting to the major classes and underfitting to the minor classes.

Open-world instance segmentation (OWIS) models address this challenge by detecting unknown objects in a class-agnostic manner. However, previous OWIS approaches completely erase category information during training to keep the model's ability to generalize to unknown objects. In this work, we propose a novel training mechanism called SegPrompt that utilizes category information to improve the model's class-agnostic segmentation ability for both known and unknown categories. In addition, the previous OWIS training setting exposes the unknown classes to the training set and brings information leakage, which is unreasonable in the real world.

We investigate normal-to-adverse condition model adaptation for semantic segmentation, whereby image-level correspondences are available in the target domain. The target set consists of unlabeled pairs of adverse- and normal-condition street images taken at GPS-matched locations. Our method--CMA--leverages such image pairs to learn condition-invariant features via contrastive learning. In particular, CMA encourages features in the embedding space to be grouped according to their condition-invariant semantic content and not according to the condition under which respective inputs are captured. To obtain accurate cross-domain semantic correspondences, we warp the normal image to the viewpoint of the adverse image and leverage warp-confidence scores to create robust, aggregated features.

Unfortunately, existing approaches limit themselves to the automotive domain, resulting in models incapable of generalizing to complex environments such as natural or indoor settings. To address this, we propose a large-scale SlowTV dataset curated from YouTube, containing an order of magnitude more data than existing automotive datasets. SlowTV contains 1.7M images from a rich diversity of environments, such as worldwide seasonal hiking, scenic driving and scuba diving. Using this dataset, we train an SS-MDE model that provides zero-shot generalization to a large collection of indoor/outdoor datasets. The resulting model outperforms all existing SSL approaches and closes the gap on supervised SoTA, despite using a more efficient architecture.

Although most recent works have adopted physics-based models to synthesize noise, the signal-independent noise in low-light conditions is far more complicated and varies dramatically across camera sensors, which is beyond the description of these models. To address this issue, we introduce a new perspective to synthesize the signal-independent noise by a generative model. Specifically, we synthesize the signal-dependent and signal-independent noise in a physics- and learning-based manner, respectively. In this way, our method can be considered as a general model, that is, it can simultaneously learn different noise characteristics for different ISO levels and generalize to various sensors. Subsequently, we present an effective multi-scale discriminator termed Fourier transformer discriminator (FTD) to distinguish the noise distribution accurately. Additionally, we collect a new low-light raw denoising (LRD) dataset for training and benchmarking. Qualitative validation shows that the noise generated by our proposed noise model can be highly similar to the real noise in terms of distribution. Furthermore, extensive denoising experiments demonstrate that our method performs favorably against state-of-the-art methods on different sensors.",True,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/papers/Hartman_BaRe-ESA_A_Riemannian_Framework_for_Unregistered_Human_Body_Shapes_ICCV_2023_paper.pdf

We propose a new paradigm of learning human-human interactions as free text from a single still image, allowing for flexibility in modeling the unlimited space of situations and relationships between people. To overcome the absence of data labelled specifically for this task, we use knowledge distillation applied to synthetic caption data produced by a large language model without explicit supervision. We show that the pseudo-labels produced by this procedure can be used to train a captioning model to effectively understand human-human interactions in images, as measured by a variety of metrics that measure textual and semantic faithfulness and factual groundedness of our predictions.

However, manual annotations are difficult, time-consuming, and costly. The canonical semi-supervised learning (SSL) methods ignore the consistency, extensibility, and adaptability of structural knowledge across spatial-temporal domains. Furthermore, the reliance on offline design and excessive parameters hinder the efficiency of the learning process. To remedy these issues, we propose a lightweight and on-line semi-supervised framework, a so-called Knowledge-Spreader (KS), to learn AU dynamics with sparse annotations. By formulating SSL as a Progressive Knowledge Distillation (PKD) problem, we aim to infer cross-domain information, specifically from spatial to temporal domains, by consistifying knowledge granularity within Teacher-Students Network. Specifically, KS employs sparsely annotated key-frames to learn AU dependencies as the privileged knowledge. Then, the model spreads the learned knowledge to their unlabeled neighbours by jointly applying knowledge distillation and pseudo-labeling, and completes the temporal information as the expanded knowledge. We term the progressive knowledge distillation as ""Knowledge Spreading"", which allows our model to learn spatial-temporal knowledge from video clips with only one label allocated. Extensive experiments demonstrate that KS achieves competitive performance as compared to the state of the arts under the circumstances of using only 2% labels on BP4D and 5% labels on DISFA.

However, despite researchers exploring cross-lingual translation techniques such as machine translation and audio speech translation to overcome language barriers, there is still a shortage of cross-lingual studies on visual speech. This lack of research is mainly due to the absence of datasets containing visual speech and translated text pairs. In this paper, we present AVMuST-TED, the first dataset for Audio-Visual Multilingual Speech Translation, derived from TED talks. Nonetheless, visual speech is not as distinguishable as audio speech, making it difficult to develop a mapping from source speech phonemes to the target language text. To address this issue, we propose MixSpeech, a cross-modality self-learning framework that utilizes audio speech to regularize the training of visual speech tasks. To further minimize the cross-modality gap and its impact on knowledge transfer, we suggest adopting mixed speech, which is created by interpolating audio and visual streams, along with a curriculum learning strategy to adjust the mixing ratio as needed. MixSpeech enhances speech translation in noisy environments, improving BLEU scores for four languages on AVMuST-TED by +1.4 to +4.2.

Modeling the shape of objects that are manipulated by the hand is essential for AI to comprehend daily tasks and to learn manipulation skills. However, previous approaches have encountered difficulties in reconstructing the precise shapes of hand-held objects, primarily owing to a deficiency in prior shape knowledge and inadequate data for training. As illustrated, given a particular type of tool, such as a mug, despite its infinite variations in shape and appearance, humans have a limited number of 'effective' modes and poses for its manipulation. This can be attributed to the fact that humans have mastered the shape prior of the 'mug' category, and can quickly establish the corresponding relations between different mug instances and the prior, such as where the rim and handle are located. In light of this, we propose a new method, CHORD, for Category-level Hand-held Object Reconstruction via shape Deformation. CHORD deforms a categorical shape prior for reconstructing the intra-class objects. To ensure accurate reconstruction, we empower CHORD with three types of awareness: appearance, shape, and interacting pose. In addition, we have constructed a new dataset, COMIC, of category-level hand-object interaction. COMIC contains a rich array of object instances, materials, hand interactions, and viewing directions.

Black, Gül Varol","Our goal is to synthesize 3D human motions given textual inputs describing simultaneous actions, for example `waving hand' while `walking' at the same time. We refer to generating such simultaneous movements as performing `spatial compositions'. In contrast to `temporal compositions' that seek to transition from one action to another, spatial compositing requires understanding which body parts are involved with which action, to be able to move them simultaneously. Motivated by the observation that the correspondence between actions and body parts is encoded in powerful language models, we extract this knowledge by prompting GPT-3 with text such as ""what are the body parts involved in the action <action name>?"", while also providing the parts list and a few examples. Given this action-part mapping, we combine body parts from two motions together and establish the first automated method to spatially compose two actions. However, training data with compositional actions is always limited by the combinatorics. Hence, we further create synthetic data with this approach, and use it to train a new state-of-the-art text-to-motion generation model, called SINC (""SImultaneous actioN Compositions for 3D human motions"").

While intrinsic methods based on functional maps can produce high-quality correspondences, they work under isometric assumptions and become unreliable for garment deformations which are highly non-isometric. To achieve wrinkle-level as well as texture-level alignment, we present a novel coarse-to-fine two-stage method that leverages intrinsic manifold properties with two neural deformation fields, in the 3D space and the intrinsic space, respectively. The coarse stage performs a 3D fitting, where we leverage intrinsic manifold properties to define a manifold deformation field. The coarse fitting then induces a functional map that produces an alignment of intrinsic embeddings. We further refine the intrinsic alignment with a second neural deformation field for higher accuracy. We evaluate our method with our captured garment dataset, GarmCap.

Addressing this, we introduce PlanarTrack, a large-scale challenging planar tracking benchmark. Specifically, PlanarTrack consists of 1,000 videos with more than 490K images. All these videos are collected in complex unconstrained scenarios from the wild, which makes PlanarTrack, compared with existing benchmarks, more challenging but realistic for real-world applications. To ensure the high-quality annotation, each frame in PlanarTrack is manually labeled using four corners with multiple-round careful inspection and refinement. To our best knowledge, PlanarTrack, to date, is the largest and most challenging dataset dedicated to planar object tracking. In order to analyze the proposed PlanarTrack, we evaluate 10 planar trackers and conduct comprehensive comparisons and in-depth analysis. Our results, not surprisingly, demonstrate that current top-performing planar trackers degenerate significantly on the challenging PlanarTrack and more efforts are needed to improve planar tracking in the future. In addition, we further derive a variant named PlanarTrack_BB for generic object tracking from PlanarTrack.

 In this paper, we propose a novel approach, called Coarse-to-Fine Segmentation (C2F-Seg), that addresses this problem by progressively modeling the amodal segmentation.
 C2F-Seg initially reduces the learning space from the pixel-level image space to the vector-quantized latent space.
 This enables us to better handle long-range dependencies and learn a coarse-grained amodal segment from visual features and visible segments.
 However, this latent space lacks detailed information about the object, which makes it difficult to provide a precise segmentation directly.
 To address this issue, we propose a convolution refine module to inject fine-grained information and provide a more precise amodal object segmentation based on visual features and coarse-predicted segmentation.
 To help the studies of amodal object segmentation, we create a synthetic amodal dataset, named as MOViD-Amodal (MOViD-A), which can be used for both image and video amodal object segmentation.

While these results are impressive and suggest that STR could be considered solved, however, we argue that this is primarily due to the less challenging nature of the common benchmarks, thus concealing the underlying issues that STR faces. To this end, we consolidate a large-scale real STR dataset, namely Union14M, which comprises 4 million labeled images and 10 million unlabeled images, to assess the performance of STR models in more complex real-world scenarios. Our experiments demonstrate that the 13 models can only achieve an average accuracy of 66.53% on the 4 million labeled images, indicating that STR still faces numerous challenges in the real world. By analyzing the error patterns of the 13 models, we identify seven open challenges in STR and develop a challenge-driven benchmark consisting of eight distinct subsets to facilitate further progress in the field.

As existing datasets are either infeasible for egocentric viewpoints or lack background variations, we create a large-scale synthetic dataset with diverse scenarios and collect a real dataset from multi-calibrated camera setup to verify our proposed multi-view image feature fusion strategy. To make the reconstruction physically plausible, we propose two strategies: (i) a coarse-to-fine spectral graph convolution decoder to smoothen the meshes during upsampling and (ii) an optimisation-based refinement stage at inference to prevent self-penetrations. Through extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations, we show that our framework is able to produce realistic two-hand reconstructions and demonstrate the generalisation of synthetic-trained models to real data, as well as real-time AR/VR applications.",True,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/papers/Sun_Communication-Efficient_Vertical_Federated_Learning_with_Limited_Overlapping_Samples_ICCV_2023_paper.pdf

Given a succinct natural language goal, e.g., ""make a shelf"", and a video of the user's progress so far, the aim of VPA is to devise a plan, i.e., a sequence of actions such as ""sand shelf"", ""paint shelf"", etc. to realize the specified goal. This requires assessing the user's progress from the (untrimmed) video, and relating it to the requirements of natural language goal, i.e., which actions to select and in what order? Consequently, this requires handling long video history and arbitrarily complex action dependencies. To address these challenges, we decompose VPA into video action segmentation and forecasting. Importantly, we experiment by formulating the forecasting step as a multi-modal sequence modeling problem, allowing us to leverage the strength of pre-trained LMs (as the sequence model). This novel approach, which we call Visual Language Model based Planner (VLaMP), outperforms baselines across a suite of metrics that gauge the quality of the generated plans. Furthermore, through comprehensive ablations, we also isolate the value of each component--language pre-training, visual observations, and goal information.

Li, Mingkui Tan, Chuang Gan","Vision-and-language navigation (VLN) requires an embodied agent to navigate in realistic 3D environments using natural language instructions. Existing VLN methods suffer from training on small-scale environments or unreasonable path-instruction datasets, limiting the generalization to unseen environments. There are massive house tour videos on YouTube, providing abundant real navigation experiences and layout information. However, these videos have not been explored for VLN before. In this paper, we propose to learn an agent from these videos by creating a large-scale dataset which comprises reasonable path-instruction pairs from house tour videos and pre-training the agent on it. To achieve this, we have to tackle the challenges of automatically constructing path-instruction pairs and exploiting real layout knowledge from raw and unlabeled videos. To address these, we first leverage an entropy-based method to construct the nodes of a path trajectory. Then, we propose an action-aware generator for generating instructions from unlabeled trajectories. Last, we devise a trajectory judgment pretext task to encourage the agent to mine the layout knowledge.

However, existing methods handle this problem in a 2D image space which is inadequate for 3D real-world applications. In this paper, we set up an egocentric 3D hand trajectory forecasting task that aims to predict hand trajectories in a 3D space from early observed RGB videos in a first-person view. To fulfill this goal, we propose an uncertainty-aware state space Transformer (USST) that takes the merits of the attention mechanism and aleatoric uncertainty within the framework of the classical state-space model. The model can be further enhanced by the velocity constraint and visual prompt tuning (VPT) on large vision transformers. Moreover, we develop an annotation workflow to collect 3D hand trajectories with high quality.

Given a minute-long RGBD video of people interacting with their pets, we render the scene from novel camera trajectories derived from the in-scene motion of actors: (1) egocentric cameras that simulate the point of view of a target actor and (2) 3rd-person cameras that follow the actor. Building such a system requires reconstructing the root-body and articulated motion of every actor, as well as a scene representation that supports free-viewpoint synthesis. Longer videos are more likely to capture the scene from diverse viewpoints (which helps reconstruction) but are also more likely to contain larger motions (which complicates reconstruction). To address these challenges, we present Total-Recon, the first method to photorealistically reconstruct deformable scenes from long monocular RGBD videos. Crucially, to scale to long videos, our method hierarchically decomposes the scene into the background and objects, whose motion is decomposed into carefully initialized root-body motion and local articulations.

Blind road segmentation is a key element in these walking assistant systems. However, most walking assistant systems rely on visual light images, which is dangerous in weak illumination environments such as darkness or fog. To address this issue and enhance the safety of vision-based walking assistant systems, we developed a thermal infrared blind road segmentation neural network (TINN). In contrast to conventional segmentation techniques that primarily concentrate on enhancing feature extraction and perception, our approach is geared towards preserving the inherent radiation characteristics within the thermal imaging process. Initially, we modelled two critical factors in thermal infrared imaging - thermal light atmospheric transmission and thermal inertia effect. Subsequently, we use an encoder-decoder architecture to fuse the feathers extracted by the two modules. Additionally, to train the network and evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we constructed a large-scale thermal infrared blind road segmentation dataset named TBRSD consists 5180 pixel-level manual annotations.

Here we study the task of text-driven human video generation, where a video sequence is synthesized from texts describing the appearance and motions of a target performer. Compared to general text-driven video generation, human-centric video generation requires maintaining the appearance of synthesized human while performing complex motions. In this work, we present Text2Performer to generate vivid human videos with articulated motions from texts. Text2Performer has two novel designs: 1) decomposed human representation and 2) diffusion-based motion sampler. First, we decompose the VQVAE latent space into human appearance and pose representation in an unsupervised manner by utilizing the nature of human videos. In this way, the appearance is well maintained along the generated frames. Then, we propose continuous VQ-diffuser to sample a sequence of pose embeddings. Unlike existing VQ-based methods that operate in the discrete space, continuous VQ-diffuser directly outputs the continuous pose embeddings for better motion modeling. Finally, motion-aware masking strategy is designed to mask the pose embeddings spatial-temporally to enhance the temporal coherence. Moreover, to facilitate the task of text-driven human video generation, we contribute a Fashion-Text2Video dataset with manually annotated action labels and text descriptions.

In lab-controlled emotion datasets, such a critical component (i.e., stimulus) was commonly designed in a limited way, making researchers incapable of generalizing the universal correlation and causation of stimulus-reaction as well as predicting possible emotions from context, timing, and relation. In this paper, we collected a large-scale spontaneous facial behavior database ReactioNet, which contains 1.1 million coupled stimulus-reaction tuples (visual/audio/caption from both stimuli and subjects). We introduce a new facial behavior detection scenario, Dyadic Relation Reasoning (DRR), which aims to detect facial actions by reasoning their relations with stimuli. By aggregating the dyadic information, our method essentially forms a relation prototype Universal Stimulus Reaction (U-SR), which encodes the low-order and high-order relationships between stimulus agents and facial reactions. A framework with both non-graph and graph modules is further developed to evaluate DRR-based facial action unit detection, facial expression recognition, and scene classification. Specifically, to learn ""what"" arouses a facial reaction, the non-graph module associates and projects the fine-grained stimulus-reaction features into common subspaces using cross-domain contrastive learning. To learn ""how"" stimulus-reaction are mutually related, the graph module adopts Graph Convolution Network to represent, converge, and infer the dyadic U-SR relation under two relation assumptions (i.e., homophily and heterophily).

This work is part of a broader research effort to develop intelligent agents that can interactively guide humans through performing tasks in the physical world. As a first step in this direction, we introduce HoloAssist, a large-scale egocentric human interaction dataset, where two people collaboratively complete physical manipulation tasks. The task performer executes the task while wearing a mixed-reality headset that captures seven synchronized data streams. The task instructor watches the performer's egocentric video in real time and guides them verbally. By augmenting the data with action and conversational annotations and observing the rich behaviors of various participants, we present key insights into how human assistants correct mistakes, intervene in the task completion procedure, and ground their instructions to the environment. HoloAssist spans 166 hours of data captured by 350 unique instructor-performer pairs. Furthermore, we construct and present benchmarks on mistake detection, intervention type prediction, and hand forecasting, along with detailed analysis.

Neuromorphic vision sensors (event-cameras) have been recently considered a valid solution to the privacy issue because they do not capture detailed RGB visual information of the subjects in the scene. However, recent deep learning architectures have been able to reconstruct images from event cameras with high fidelity, reintroducing a potential threat to privacy for event-based vision applications. In this paper, we aim to anonymize event-streams to protect the identity of human subjects against such image reconstruction attacks. To achieve this, we propose an end-to-end network architecture jointly optimized for the twofold objective of preserving privacy and performing a downstream task such as person ReId. Our network learns to scramble events, enforcing the degradation of images recovered from the privacy attacker. In this work, we also bring to the community the first ever event-based person ReId dataset gathered to evaluate the performance of our approach.

While current AE algorithms are effective in well-lit environments with constant illumination, these algorithms still struggle in environments with bright light sources or scenes with abrupt changes in lighting. A significant hurdle in developing new AE algorithms for challenging environments, especially those with time-varying lighting, is the lack of suitable image datasets. To address this issue, we have captured a new 4D exposure dataset that provides a large solution space (i.e., shutter speed range from 1/500 to 15 seconds) over a temporal sequence with moving objects, bright lights, and varying lighting. In addition, we have designed a software platform to allow AE algorithms to be used in a plug-and-play manner with the dataset.

The essence is to leverage the contextual information, including both dynamic and static semantics, for better image generation. Existing methods often focus on the spatial misalignment across input frames caused by the foreground and/or camera motion. However, there is no research on jointly leveraging the dynamic and static context in a simultaneous manner. To delve into this problem, we propose a novel alignment-free network with a Semantics Consistent Transformer (SCTNet) with both spatial and channel attention modules in the network. The spatial attention aims to deal with the intra-image correlation to model the dynamic motion, while the channel attention enables the inter-image intertwining to enhance the semantic consistency across frames. Aside from this, we introduce a novel realistic HDR dataset with more variations in foreground objects, environmental factors, and larger motions.

State-of-the-art solutions, such as ControlNet and T2I-Adapter, introduce an additional learnable branch on top of the frozen pre-trained stable diffusion (SD) model, which can enforce various kinds of conditions, including skeleton guidance of HIG. While such a plug-and-play approach is appealing, the inevitable and uncertain conflicts between the original images produced from the frozen SD branch and the given condition incur significant challenges for the learnable branch, which conduct the condition learning via image feature editing.
 In this work, we propose a native skeleton-guided diffusion model for controllable HIG called HumanSD. Instead of performing image editing with dual-branch diffusion, we fine-tune the original SD model using a novel heatmap-guided denoising loss. This strategy effectively and efficiently strengthens the given skeleton condition during model training while mitigating the catastrophic forgetting effects. HumanSD is fine-tuned on the assembly of three large-scale human-centric datasets with text-image-pose information, two of which are established in this work.

We address this challenge by proposing a novel synthetic vision dataset, named FunnyBirds, and accompanying automatic evaluation protocols. Our dataset allows performing semantically meaningful image interventions, e.g., removing individual object parts, which has three important implications. First, it enables analyzing explanations on a part level, which is closer to human comprehension than existing methods that evaluate on a pixel level. Second, by comparing the model output for inputs with removed parts, we can estimate ground-truth part importances that should be reflected in the explanations. Third, by mapping individual explanations into a common space of part importances, we can analyze a variety of different explanation types in a single common framework.

In this paper, we study a practical problem of Domain Generalization under Category Shift (DGCS), which aims to simultaneously detect unknown-class samples and classify known-class samples in the target domains. Compared to prior DG works, we face two new challenges: 1) how to learn the concept of ""unknown"" during training with only source known-class samples, and 2) how to adapt the source-trained model to unseen environments for safe model deployment. To this end, we propose a novel Activate and Reject (ART) framework to reshape the model's decision boundary to accommodate unknown classes and conduct post hoc modification to further discriminate known and unknown classes using unlabeled test data. Specifically, during training, we promote the response to the unknown by optimizing the unknown probability and then smoothing the overall output to mitigate the overconfidence issue. At test time, we introduce a step-wise online adaptation method that predicts the label by virtue of the cross-domain nearest neighbor and class prototype information without updating the network's parameters or using threshold-based mechanisms.

However, existing relevant benchmarks lack diversity in urban scenes, and they only evaluate front-view predictions. Towards a comprehensive benchmarking of surrounding perception algorithms, we propose OpenOccupancy, which is the first surrounding semantic occupancy perception benchmark. In the OpenOccupancy benchmark, we extend the large-scale nuScenes dataset with dense semantic occupancy annotations.

However, some intractable challenges are urgent to be settled. For example, the data-scarcity problem is intrinsically inevitable due to the difficulty of 4D data collection. Besides, current methods generally lack controllability on the animated face. To this end, we propose a novel framework named Speech4Mesh to consecutively generate 4D talking head data and train the audio2mesh network with the reconstructed meshes. In our framework, we first reconstruct the 4D talking head sequence based on the monocular videos. For precise capture of the talking-related variation on the face, we exploit the audio-visual alignment information from the video by employing a contrastive learning scheme. We next can train the audio2mesh network (e.g., FaceFormer) based on the generated 4D data. To get control of the animated talking face, we encode the speaking-unrelated factors (e.g., emotion, etc.) into an emotion embedding for manipulation. Finally, a differentiable renderer guarantees more accurate photometric details of the reconstruction and animation results. Empirical experiments demonstrate that the Speech4Mesh framework can not only outperform state-of-the-art reconstruction methods, especially on the lower-face part but also achieve better animation performance both perceptually and objectively after pre-trained on the synthesized data.

However, most proposed settings concentrate on 3D modelling a single object or a single level of a scene. However, in the real world, a person captures a structure at multiple levels, resulting in layered capture. For example, tourists usually capture a monument's exterior structure before capturing the inner structure. Modelling such scenes in 3D with seamless switching between levels can drastically improve the Virtual Reality (VR) experience. However, most of the existing techniques struggle in modelling such scenes. Hence, we propose Strata-NeRF, a single radiance field that can implicitly learn the 3D representation of outer, inner, and subsequent levels. Strata-NeRF achieves this by conditioning the NeRFs on Vector Quantized (VQ) latents which allows sudden changes in scene structure with changes in levels due to their discrete nature. We first investigate the proposed approach's effectiveness by modelling a novel multilayered synthetic dataset comprising diverse scenes and then further validate its generalization on the real-world RealEstate dataset.

Black","Understanding how humans use physical contact to interact with the world is key to enabling human-centric artificial intelligence. While inferring 3D contact is crucial for modeling realistic and physically-plausible human-object interactions, existing methods either focus on 2D, consider body joints rather than the surface, use coarse 3D body regions, or do not generalize to in-the-wild images. In contrast, we focus on inferring dense, 3D contact between the full body surface and objects in arbitrary images. To achieve this, we first collect DAMON, a new dataset containing dense vertex-level contact annotations paired with RGB images containing complex human-object and human-scene contact. Second, we train DECO, a novel 3D contact detector that uses both body-part-driven and scene-context-driven attention to estimate vertex-level contact on the SMPL body.

To push the related frontier research, we introduce a new benchmark called Open-World DeepFake Attribution (OW-DFA), which aims to evaluate attribution performance against various types of fake faces under open-world scenarios. Meanwhile, we propose a novel framework named Contrastive Pseudo Learning (CPL) for the OW-DFA task through 1) introducing a Global-Local Voting module to guide the feature alignment of forged faces with different manipulated regions, 2) designing a Confidence-based Soft Pseudo-label strategy to mitigate the pseudo-noise caused by similar methods in unlabeled set. In addition, we extend the CPL framework with a multi-stage paradigm that leverages pre-train technique and iterative learning to further enhance traceability performance. Extensive experiments verify the superiority of our proposed method on the OW-DFA and also demonstrate the interpretability of deepfake attribution task and its impact on improving the security of deepfake detection area.",True,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/papers/Lou_ELFNet_Evidential_Local-global_Fusion_for_Stereo_Matching_ICCV_2023_paper.pdf

Instead of browsing product pages, consumers are now turning to rich-content e-commerce, where they can purchase products through dynamic and interactive media like short videos and live streams. This emerging form of online shopping has presented new opportunities for platforms to enhance user engagement and shopping experience. However, it has also introduced technical challenges, as products may be presented differently across various media domains. Therefore, a unified product representation is essential for achieving cross-domain product recognition to ensure an optimal user search experience and effective product recommendations. Despite the urgent industrial need for a unified cross-domain product representation, previous studies have predominantly focused only on product pages without taking into account short videos and live streams. To fill the gap in the rich-content e-commerce area, in this paper, we introduce a large-scale cross-domain poduct recognition dataset, called ROPE. ROPE covers a wide range of product categories and contains over 180,000 products, corresponding to millions of short videos and live streams. It is the first dataset to cover product pages, short videos, and live streams simultaneously, providing the basis for establishing a unified product representation across different media domains. Furthermore, we propose a cross-domain product representation framework, namely COPE, which unifies product representations in different domains through multimodal learning including text and vision. Extensive experiments on downstream tasks like cross-modal retrieval and classification demonstrate the effectiveness of COPE in learning a joint feature space for all product domains.",True,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/papers/Kim_EP2P-Loc_End-to-End_3D_Point_to_2D_Pixel_Localization_for_Large-Scale_ICCV_2023_paper.pdf

ICAA is important for various applications such as imaging measurement and image analysis. However, due to the highly diverse aesthetic preferences and numerous color combinations, ICAA presents more challenges than conventional image quality assessment tasks.
 To advance ICAA research, 1) we propose a baseline model called the Delegate Transformer, which not only deploys deformable transformers to adaptively allocate interest points, but also learns human color space segmentation behavior by the dedicated module.
 2) We elaborately build a color-oriented dataset, ICAA17K, containing 17K images, covering 30 popular color combinations, 80 devices and 50 scenes, with each image densely annotated by more than 1,500 people. Moreover, we develop a large-scale benchmark of 15 methods, the most comprehensive one thus far based on two datasets, SPAQ and ICAA17K.

Existing shape from polarization(SfP) methods have the difficulty in estimating transparent shape since the inherent transmission interference heavily reduces the reliability of physics-based prior. To address this challenge, we propose the concept of physics-based prior confidence, which is inspired by the characteristic that the transmission component in the polarization image has more noise than reflection. The confidence is used to determine the contribution of the interfered physics-based prior. Then, we build a network(TransSfP) with multi-branch architecture to avoid the destruction of relationships between different hierarchical inputs.

We introduce a more efficient approach, called DynaMITe, in which we represent user interactions as spatio-temporal queries to a Transformer decoder with a potential to segment multiple object instances in a single iteration. Our architecture also alleviates any need to re-compute image features during refinement, and requires fewer interactions for segmenting multiple instances in a single image when compared to other methods.

Recently, many works have focused on one-shot talking face generation to drive a portrait with a real video, i.e., within-domain reenactment. Straightforwardly applying those methods to cross-domain animation will cause inaccurate expression transfer, blur effects, and even apparent artifacts due to the domain shift between cartoon and real faces. Only a few works attempt to settle cross-domain face reenactment. The most related work AnimeCeleb requires constructing a dataset with pose vector and cartoon image pairs by animating 3D characters, which makes it inapplicable anymore if no paired data is available. In this paper, we propose a novel method for cross-domain reenactment without paired data. Specifically, we propose a transformer-based framework to align the motions from different domains into a common latent space where motion transfer is conducted via latent code addition. Two domain-specific motion encoders and two learnable motion base memories are used to capture domain properties. A source query transformer and a driving one are exploited to project domain-specific motion to the canonical space. The edited motion is projected back to the domain of the source with a transformer.

To efficiently obtain the best combination of locations, a greedy algorithm based on the perceptual gain is proposed, which selects the location that can maximize the perceptual gain sequentially. We define perceptual gain as the increased perceptual capability when a new LiDAR is placed. To obtain the perception capability, we propose a perception predictor that learns to evaluate LiDAR placement using only a single point cloud frame.

The video background is clearly a source of static bias, but the video foreground, such as the clothing of the actor, can also provide static bias. In this paper, we empirically verify the existence of foreground static bias by creating test videos with conflicting signals from the static and moving portions of the video. To tackle this issue, we propose a simple yet effective technique, StillMix, to learn robust action representations. Specifically, StillMix identifies bias-inducing video frames using a 2D reference network and mixes them with videos for training, serving as effective bias suppression even when we cannot explicitly extract the source of bias within each video frame or enumerate types of bias.

However, these datasets lack universality and are hard to benchmark general detectors built on common tasks such as COCO. To give a more comprehensive robustness assessment, we introduce COCO-O(ut-of-distribution), a test dataset based on COCO with 6 types of natural distribution shifts. COCO-O has a large distribution gap with training data and results in a significant 55.7% relative performance drop on a Faster R-CNN detector.

Unfortunately, most classic detectors in early years do not exhibit strong OOD generalization. We further study the robustness effect on recent breakthroughs of detector's architecture design, augmentation and pre-training techniques. Some empirical findings are revealed: 1) Compared with detection head or neck, backbone is the most important part for robustness; 2) An end-to-end detection transformer design brings no enhancement, and may even reduce robustness; 3) Large-scale foundation models have made a great leap on robust object detection.

The goal in EgoTV is to verify the execution of tasks from egocentric videos based on the natural language description of these tasks. EgoTV contains pairs of videos and their task descriptions for multi-step tasks -- these tasks contain multiple sub-task decompositions, state changes, object interactions, and sub-task ordering constraints. In addition, EgoTV also provides abstracted task descriptions that contain only partial details about ways to accomplish a task. Consequently, EgoTV requires causal, temporal, and compositional reasoning of video and language modalities, which is missing in existing datasets. We also find that existing vision-language models struggle at such all round reasoning needed for task verification in EgoTV. Inspired by the needs of EgoTV, we propose a novel Neuro-Symbolic Grounding (NSG) approach that leverages symbolic representations to capture the compositional and temporal structure of tasks. We demonstrate NSG's capability towards task tracking and verification on our EgoTV dataset and a real-world dataset derived from CrossTask (CTV). We open-source the EgoTV and CTV datasets and the NSG model for future research on egocentric assistive agents.",True,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/papers/Maeda_Fast_Inference_and_Update_of_Probabilistic_Density_Estimation_on_Trajectory_ICCV_2023_paper.pdf

Like semantic segmentation extends classification to the pixel level, pixel retrieval is an extension of image retrieval and offers information about which pixels are related to the query object. In addition to retrieving images for the given query, it helps users quickly identify the query object in true positive images and exclude false positive images by denoting the correlated pixels. Our user study results show pixel-level annotation can significantly improve the user experience. Compared with semantic and instance segmentation, pixel retrieval requires a fine-grained recognition capability for variable-granularity targets. To this end, we propose pixel retrieval benchmarks named PROxford and PRParis, which are based on the widely used image retrieval datasets, ROxford and RParis. Three professional annotators label 5,942 images with two rounds of double-checking and refinement. Furthermore, we conduct extensive experiments and analysis on the SOTA methods in image search, image matching, detection, segmentation, and dense matching using our pixel retrieval benchmarks. Results show that the pixel retrieval task is challenging to these approaches and distinctive from existing problems, suggesting that further research can advance the content-based pixel-retrieval and, thus, user search experience.",True,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/papers/Vasu_FastViT_A_Fast_Hybrid_Vision_Transformer_Using_Structural_Reparameterization_ICCV_2023_paper.pdf

Therefore, we present a large-scale synthetic dataset --RenderIH-- for interacting hands with accurate and diverse pose annotations.

We demonstrate that joint audio-visual modeling can improve class-incremental learning, but current methods fail to preserve semantic similarity between audio and visual features as incremental step grows. Furthermore, we observe that audio-visual correlations learned in previous tasks can be forgotten as incremental steps progress, leading to poor performance. To overcome these challenges, we propose AV-CIL, which incorporates Dual-Audio-Visual Similarity Constraint (D-AVSC) to maintain both instance-aware and class-aware semantic similarity between audio-visual modalities and Visual Attention Distillation (VAD) to retain previously learned audio-guided visual attentive ability.

By contrast, the event camera can asynchronously capture the intensity changes with a very high temporal resolution, providing complementary dynamic information of the observed scenes. In this paper, we incorporate RGB images, Point clouds and Events for joint optical flow and scene flow estimation with our proposed multi-stage multimodal fusion model, RPEFlow.

Therefore, in addition to finding the distinguishable part from the current view, efficient and accurate recognition requires inferring the critical perspective with minimal glances.

Specially, we leverage a imitator, consisting of a Deformation Controller and a Mask Controller, respectively in charge of predicting deformation parameters and producing a per-point mask, based on the intrinsic structural information of the input point cloud, and then conduct corruption simulations on top. Then a discriminator is utilized to prevent the generation of excessive corruption that deviates from the original data distribution.

A large domain gap exists between the generic images/texts used in public pre-trained models and the specific person data in the T2I-ReID task. This gap is especially severe for texts, as general textual data are usually unable to describe specific people in fine-grained detail. ii) Training inconsistency.

Importantly, we investigate the influence of each component in this paradigm on the agent's performance and study how to adequately apply the augmented data to pre-train and fine-tune an agent. Thanks to our large-scale dataset, the performance of an existing agent can be pushed up (+11% absolute with regard to previous SoTA) to a significantly new best of 80% single-run success rate on the R2R test split by simple imitation learning. The long-lasting generalization gap between navigating in seen and unseen environments is also reduced to less than 1% (versus 8% in the previous best method). Moreover, our paradigm also facilitates different models to achieve new state-of-the-art navigation results on CVDN, REVERIE, and R2R in continuous environments.",True,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/papers/Gao_Human-Inspired_Facial_Sketch_Synthesis_with_Dynamic_Adaptation_ICCV_2023_paper.pdf

We investigate how natural background colors play a role as spurious features by annotating the test sets of CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 into subgroups based on the background color of each image. We name our datasets CIFAR10-B and CIFAR100-B and integrate them with CIFAR-Cs. We find that overall human-level accuracy does not guarantee consistent subgroup performances, and the phenomenon remains even on models pre-trained on ImageNet or after data augmentation (DA). To alleviate this issue, we propose FlowAug, a semantic DA that leverages decoupled semantic representations captured by a pre-trained generative flow. Experimental results show that FlowAug achieves more consistent subgroup results than other types of DA methods on CIFAR10/100 and on CIFAR10/100-C. Additionally, it shows better generalization performance. Furthermore, we propose a generic metric, MacroStd, for studying model robustness to spurious correlations, where we take a macro average on the weighted standard deviations across different classes. We show MacroStd being more predictive of better performances; per our metric, FlowAug demonstrates improvements on subgroup discrepancy. Although this metric is proposed to study our curated datasets, it applies to all datasets that have subgroups or subclasses.

However, collecting, processing, and annotating real data at scale is difficult, expensive, and time-consuming, particularly for tasks such as 3D object registration. While synthetic datasets can be created, they require expertise to design and include a limited number of categories. In this paper, we introduce a new approach called AutoSynth, which automatically generates 3D training data for point cloud registration. Specifically, AutoSynth automatically curates an optimal dataset by exploring a search space encompassing millions of potential datasets with diverse 3D shapes at a low cost. To achieve this, we generate synthetic 3D datasets by assembling shape primitives, and develop a meta-learning strategy to search for the best training data for 3D registration on real point clouds. For this search to remain tractable, we replace the point cloud registration network with a much smaller surrogate network, leading to a 4056.43 times speedup. We demonstrate the generality of our approach by implementing it with two different point cloud registration networks, BPNet and IDAM.

However, in more realistic scenarios, only minimal annotations are available for a new scene, which poses significant challenges to existing RVOS methods. With this in mind, we propose a simple yet effective model with a newly designed cross-modal affinity (CMA) module based on a Transformer architecture. The CMA module builds multimodal affinity with a few samples, thus quickly learning new semantic information, and enabling the model to adapt to different scenarios. Since the proposed method targets limited samples for new scenes, we generalize the problem as - few-shot referring video object segmentation (FS-RVOS). To foster research in this direction, we build up a new FS-RVOS benchmark based on currently available datasets. The benchmark covers a wide range and includes multiple situations, which can maximally simulate real-world scenarios. Extensive experiments show that our model adapts well to different scenarios with only a few samples, reaching state-of-the-art performance on the benchmark.

In this paper, we propose a frustratingly simple but effective step-wise learning framework to gradually enhance the capability of the model in detecting all categories of long-tailed datasets. Specifically, we build smooth-tail data where the long-tailed distribution of categories decays smoothly to correct the bias towards head classes. We pre-train a model on the whole long-tailed data to preserve discriminability between all categories. We then fine-tune the class-agnostic modules of the pre-trained model on the head class dominant replay data to get a head class expert model with improved decision boundaries from all categories. Finally, we train a unified model on the tail class dominant replay data while transferring knowledge from the head class expert model to ensure accurate detection of all categories. Extensive experiments on long-tailed datasets LVIS v0.5 and LVIS v1.0 demonstrate the superior performance of our method, where we can improve the AP with ResNet-50 backbone from 27.0% to 30.3% AP, and especially for the rare categories from 15.5% to 24.9% AP.

Existing methods to measure bias depend on benchmark datasets that are collected in the wild and annotated for protected (e.g., race, gender) and non-protected (e.g., pose, lighting) attributes. Such observational datasets only permit correlational conclusions, e.g., ""Algorithm A's accuracy is different on female and male faces in dataset X."". By contrast, experimental methods manipulate attributes individually and thus permit causal conclusions, e.g., ""Algorithm A's accuracy is affected by gender and skin color."" Our method is based on generating synthetic faces using a neural face generator, where each attribute of interest is modified independently while leaving all other attributes constant. Human observers crucially provide the ground truth on perceptual identity similarity between synthetic image pairs. We validate our method quantitatively by evaluating race and gender biases of three research-grade face recognition models. Our synthetic pipeline reveals that for these algorithms, accuracy is lower for Black and East Asian population subgroups. Our method can also quantify how perceptual changes in attributes affect face identity distances reported by these models.

Alvarez","Autonomous vehicles (AV) require that neural networks used for perception be robust to different viewpoints if they are to be deployed across many types of vehicles without the repeated cost of data collection and labeling for each. AV companies typically focus on collecting data from diverse scenarios and locations, but not camera rig configurations, due to cost. As a result, only a small number of rig variations exist across most fleets. In this paper, we study how AV perception models are affected by changes in camera viewpoint and propose a way to scale them across vehicle types without repeated data collection and labeling. Using bird's eye view (BEV) segmentation as a motivating task, we find through extensive experiments that existing perception models are surprisingly sensitive to changes in camera viewpoint. When trained with data from one camera rig, small changes to pitch, yaw, depth, or height of the camera at inference time lead to large drops in performance. We introduce a technique for novel view synthesis and use it to transform collected data to the viewpoint of target rigs, allowing us to train BEV segmentation models for diverse target rigs without any additional data collection or labeling cost. To analyze the impact of viewpoint changes, we leverage synthetic data to mitigate other gaps (content, ISP, etc). Our approach is then trained on real data and evaluated on synthetic data, enabling evaluation on diverse target rigs. We release all data for use in future work.

For example, when we learn mathematics at school, we build upon our knowledge of addition to learn multiplication. These and other concepts must be mastered before our first algebra lesson, which also reinforces our addition and multiplication skills. Designing a curriculum for teaching either a human or a machine shares the underlying goal of maximizing knowledge transfer from earlier to later tasks, while also minimizing forgetting of learned tasks. Prior research on curriculum design for image classification focuses on the ordering of training examples during a single offline task. Here, we investigate the effect of the order in which multiple distinct tasks are learned in a sequence. We focus on the online class-incremental continual learning setting, where algorithms or humans must learn image classes one at a time during a single pass through a dataset. We find that curriculum consistently influences learning outcomes for humans and for multiple continual machine learning algorithms across several benchmark datasets. We introduce a novel-object recognition dataset for human curriculum learning experiments and observe that curricula that are effective for humans are highly correlated with those that are effective for machines. As an initial step towards automated curriculum design for online class-incremental learning, we propose a novel algorithm, dubbed Curriculum Designer (CD), that designs and ranks curricula based on inter-class feature similarities.

UW depth estimation has been attempted before by utilizing either the haze information present or the geometry cue from stereo images or the adjacent frames in a video. To obtain improved estimates of depth from a single UW image, we propose a deep learning (DL) method that utilizes both haze and geometry during training. By harnessing the physical model for UW image formation in conjunction with the view-synthesis constraint on neighboring frames in monocular videos, we perform disentanglement of the input image to also get an estimate of the scene radiance.

To deal with the scarcity of labeled data at scale, we source the step descriptions from a language knowledge base (wikiHow) containing instructional articles for a large variety of procedural tasks. Without any form of manual supervision, our model learns to temporally ground the steps of procedural articles in how-to videos by matching three modalities: frames, narrations, and step descriptions. Specifically, our method 
 aligns steps to video by fusing information from two distinct pathways: i) direct alignment of step descriptions to frames, ii) indirect alignment obtained by composing steps-to-narrations with narrations-to-video correspondences. 
 Notably, our approach performs global temporal grounding of all steps in an article at once by exploiting order information, and is trained with step pseudo-labels which are iteratively refined and aggressively filtered.

While camera rotation estimation is a well-studied problem, no previous methods exhibit both high accuracy and acceptable speed in this setting. Because the setting is not addressed well by other datasets, we provide a new dataset and benchmark, with high-accuracy, rigorously verified ground truth, on 17 video sequences. Methods developed for wide baseline stereo (e.g., 5-point methods) perform poorly on monocular video. On the other hand, methods used in autonomous driving (e.g., SLAM) leverage specific sensor setups, specific motion models, or local optimization strategies (lagging batch processing) and do not generalize well to handheld video.

 To address this, we present MatSim: the first dataset and benchmark for computer vision-based recognition of similarities and transitions between materials and textures, focusing on identifying any material under any conditions using one or a few examples.

The narrowing domain gap between real and synthetic imagery makes it possible to use CG images as training data for deep learning models targeting high-level computer vision tasks, such as autonomous driving and semantic segmentation. CG images, however, are currently not suitable for low-level vision tasks targeting RAW sensor images. This is because RAW images are encoded in sensor-specific color spaces and incur pre-white-balance color casts caused by the sensor's response to scene illumination. CG images are rendered directly to a device-independent perceptual color space without needing white balancing. As a result, it is necessary to apply a mapping procedure to close the domain gap between graphics and RAW images. To this end, we introduce a framework to process graphics images to mimic RAW sensor images accurately. Our approach allows a one-to-many mapping, where a single graphics image can be transformed to match multiple sensors and multiple scene illuminations. In addition, our approach requires only a handful of example RAW-DNG files from the target sensor as parameters for the mapping process. We compare our method to alternative strategies and show that our approach produces more realistic RAW images and provides better results on three low-level vision tasks: RAW denoising, illumination estimation, and neural rendering for night photography.

With BEAR, we thoroughly evaluate 6 common spatiotemporal models pre-trained by both supervised and self-supervised learning. We also report transfer performance via standard finetuning, few-shot fine-tuning, and unsupervised domain adaptation.

Currently, commercial depth cameras face difficulties in estimating the depth of transparent objects due to the light reflection and refraction on their surface. As a result, they tend to make a noisy and incorrect depth value for transparent objects. These incorrect depth data make the traditional RGB-D SLAM method fails in reconstructing the scenes that contain transparent objects. An exact depth value of the transparent object is required to restore in advance and it is essential that the depth value of the transparent object must keep consistent in different views, or the reconstruction result will be distorted. Previous depth prediction methods of transparent objects can restore these missing depth values but none of them can provide a good result in reconstruction due to the inconsistency prediction. In this work, we propose a real-time reconstruction method using a novel stereo-based depth prediction network to keep the consistency of depth prediction in a sequence of images. Because there is no video dataset about transparent objects currently to train our model, we construct a synthetic RGB-D video dataset with different transparent objects. Moreover, to test generalization capability, we capture video from real scenes using the RealSense D435i RGB-D camera.

Most existing solutions rely on the accurate localization of each skeleton joint. However, these methods tend to be unreliable due to the severe occlusion and confusing similarity among adjacent hand parts. This also defies human perception because humans can quickly imitate an interaction pattern without localizing all joints. Our key idea is to first construct a two-hand interaction prior and recast the interaction reconstruction task as the conditional sampling from the prior. To expand more interaction states, a large-scale multimodal dataset with physical plausibility is proposed. Then a VAE is trained to further condense these interaction patterns as latent codes in a prior distribution. When looking for image cues that contribute to interaction prior sampling, we propose the interaction adjacency heatmap (IAH). Compared with a joint-wise heatmap for localization, IAH assigns denser visible features to those invisible joints. Compared with an all-in-one visible heatmap, it provides more fine-grained local interaction information in each interaction region. Finally, the correlations between the extracted features and corresponding interaction codes are linked by the ViT module.

 While some assumptions are useful (e.g., the sky is blue), they can also be outdated, incorrect, or reflective of social biases present in the training data.
 Thus, there is a need to control these assumptions without requiring explicit user input or costly re-training.
 In this work, we aim to edit a given implicit assumption in a pre-trained diffusion model.
 Our Text-to-Image Model Editing method, TIME for short, receives a pair of inputs: a ""source"" under-specified prompt for which the model makes an implicit assumption (e.g., ""a pack of roses""), and a ""destination"" prompt that describes the same setting, but with a specified desired attribute (e.g., ""a pack of blue roses"").
 TIME then updates the model's cross-attention layers, as these layers assign visual meaning to textual tokens.
 We edit the projection matrices in these layers such that the source prompt is projected close to the destination prompt.
 Our method is highly efficient, as it modifies a mere 2.2% of the model's parameters in under one second.

As an initial step toward this problem, we evaluate attribution through ""customization"" methods, which tune an existing large-scale model toward a given exemplar object or style. Our key insight is that this allows us to efficiently create synthetic images that are computationally influenced by the exemplar by construction. With our new dataset of such exemplar-influenced images, we are able to evaluate various data attribution algorithms and different possible feature spaces. Furthermore, by training on our dataset, we can tune standard models, such as DINO, CLIP, and ViT, toward the attribution problem.

Most existing R-VOS methods have a critical assumption: the object referred to must appear in the video. This assumption, which we refer to as ""semantic consensus"", is often violated in real-world scenarios, where the expression may be queried against false videos. In this work, we highlight the need for a robust R-VOS model that can handle semantic mismatches. Accordingly, we propose an extended task called Robust R-VOS (RRVOS), which accepts unpaired video-text inputs. We tackle this problem by jointly modeling the primary R-VOS problem and its dual (text reconstruction). A structural text-to-text cycle constraint is introduced to discriminate semantic consensus between video-text pairs and impose it in positive pairs, thereby achieving multi-modal alignment from both positive and negative pairs.

However, previous methods rely on the strong assumption that one sentence must describe one target in the image, which is often not the case in real-world applications. As a result, such methods fail when the expressions refer to either no objects or multiple objects. In this paper, we address this issue from two perspectives. First, we propose a Dual Multi-Modal Interaction (DMMI) Network, which contains two decoder branches and enables information flow in two directions. In the text-to-image decoder, text embedding is utilized to query the visual feature and localize the corresponding target. Meanwhile, the image-to-text decoder is implemented to reconstruct the erased entity-phrase conditioned on the visual feature.

The naive focal length assumptions can harm this task with the incorrectly formulated projection matrices. To solve this, we propose Zolly, the first 3DHMR method focusing on perspective-distorted images. Our approach begins with analysing the reason for perspective distortion, which we find is mainly caused by the relative location of the human body to the camera center. We propose a new camera model and a novel 2D representation, termed distortion image, which describes the 2D dense distortion scale of the human body. We then estimate the distance from distortion scale features rather than environment context features. Afterwards, We integrate the distortion feature with image features to reconstruct the body mesh. To formulate the correct projection matrix and locate the human body position, we simultaneously use perspective and weak-perspective projection loss. Since existing datasets could not handle this task, we propose the first synthetic dataset PDHuman and extend two real-world datasets tailored for this task, all containing perspective-distorted human images. Extensive experiments show that Zolly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on both perspective-distorted datasets and the standard benchmark (3DPW).

In this work, we contribute a large, realistic long-term person re-identification benchmark, termed DeepChange. Its unique characteristics are: (1) Realistic and rich personal appearance (e.g., clothes and hair style) and variations: Highly diverse clothes change and styles, with varying reappearing gaps in time from minutes to seasons, different weather conditions (e.g., sunny, cloudy, windy, rainy, snowy, extremely cold) and events (e.g., working, leisure, daily activities).

However, such image cropping methods are limited in the range of image views. Some methods have been suggested to extrapolate the images and predict cropping boxes from the extrapolated image. Nonetheless, the synthesized extrapolated regions may be included in the cropped image, making the image composition result not real and potentially with degraded image quality. In this paper, we circumvent this issue by presenting a joint framework for both unbounded recommendation of camera view and image composition (i.e., UNIC). In this way, the cropped image is a sub-image of the image acquired by the predicted camera view, and thus can be guaranteed to be real and consistent in image quality. Specifically, our framework takes the current camera preview frame as input and provides a recommendation for view adjustment, which contains operations unlimited by the image borders, such as zooming in or out and camera movement. To improve the prediction accuracy of view adjustment prediction, we further extend the field of view by feature extrapolation. After one or several times of view adjustments, our method converges and results in both a camera view and a bounding box showing the image composition recommendation. Extensive experiments are conducted on the datasets constructed upon existing image cropping datasets, showing the effectiveness of our UNIC in unbounded recommendation of camera view and image composition.

In this paper, we establish a large-scale real-world burst super-resolution dataset, i.e., RealBSR, to explore the faithful reconstruction of image details from multiple frames. Furthermore, we introduce a Federated Burst Affinity network (FBAnet) to investigate non-trivial pixel-wise displacements among images under real-world image degradation. Specifically, rather than using pixel-wise alignment, our FBAnet employs a simple homography alignment from a structural geometry aspect and a Federated Affinity Fusion (FAF) strategy to aggregate the complementary information among frames. Those fused informative representations are fed to a Transformer-based module of burst representation decoding. Besides, we have conducted extensive experiments on two versions of our datasets, i.e., RealBSR-RAW and RealBSR-RGB.

We present several strategies of multi-label detection using several segmentation architectures. The experimental results highlights the importance of the multi-label detection.

However, visual analysis on them for pose estimation is challenging because it requires recovering the complete configurations of garments, which is difficult, if not impossible, to annotate in the real world. In this work, we propose a recording system, GarmentTwin, which can track garment poses in dynamic settings such as manipulation. GarmentTwin first collects garment models and RGB-D manipulation videos from the real world and then replays the manipulation process using physics-based animation. This way, we can obtain deformed garments with poses coarsely aligned with real-world observations. Finally, we adopt an optimization-based approach to fit the pose with real-world observations. We verify the fitting results quantitatively and qualitatively. With GarmentTwin, we construct a large-scale dataset named ClothPose, which consists of 30K RGB-D frames from 2K video clips on 600 garments of 10 categories. We benchmark two tasks on the proposed ClothPose: non-rigid reconstruction and pose estimation. The experiments show that previous baseline methods struggle with highly large non-rigid deformation of manipulated garments.

ICCV-2023-1172,ICCV,2023,Adaptive Illumination Mapping for Shadow Detection in Raw Images,"Jiayu Sun, Ke Xu, Youwei Pang, Lihe Zhang, Huchuan Lu, Gerhard Hancke, Rynson Lau","Shadow detection methods rely on multi-scale contrast, especially global contrast, information to locate shadows correctly. However, we observe that the camera image signal processor (ISP) tends to preserve more local contrast information by sacrificing global contrast information during the raw-to-sRGB conversion process. This often causes existing methods to fail in scenes with high global contrast but low local contrast in shadow regions. In this paper, we propose a novel method to detect shadows from raw images. Our key idea is that instead of performing a many-to-one mapping like the ISP process, we can learn a many-to-many mapping from the high dynamic range raw images to the sRGB images of different illumination, which is able to preserve multi-scale contrast for accurate shadow detection. To this end, we first construct a new shadow dataset with  7000 raw images and shadow masks. We then propose a novel network, which includes a novel adaptive illumination mapping (AIM) module to project the input raw images into sRGB images of different intensity ranges and a shadow detection module to leverage the preserved multi-scale contrast information to detect shadows. To learn the shadow-aware adaptive illumination mapping process, we propose a novel feedback mechanism to guide the AIM during training.

Typically, video tags are freely defined and uploaded by a variety of users, so they have two characteristics: abundant in quantity and disordered intra-video. It is difficult for the existing multi-label classification and generation methods to adapt directly to this task. This paper proposes a novel generative model, Order-Prompted Tag Sequence Generation (OP-TSG), according to the above characteristics. It regards video tagging as a tag sequence generation problem guided by sample-dependent order prompts. These prompts are semantically aligned with tags and enable to decouple tag generation order, making the model focus on modeling the tag dependencies. Moreover, the word-based generation strategy enables the model to generate novel tags. To verify the effectiveness and generalization of the proposed method, a Chinese video tagging benchmark CREATE-tagging, and an English image tagging benchmark Pexel-tagging are established. Extensive results show that OP-TSG is significantly superior to other methods, especially the results on rare tags improve by 3.3% and 3% over SOTA methods on CREATE-tagging and Pexel-tagging, and novel tags generated on CREATE-tagging exhibit a tag gain of 7.04%.",True,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/papers/Mao_Masked_Motion_Predictors_are_Strong_3D_Action_Representation_Learners_ICCV_2023_paper.pdf

However, the semi-transparent nature of the display inevitably introduces the severe degradation into UDC images. In this work, we address the UDC image restoration problem with the specific consideration of the scattering effect caused by the display. We explicitly model the scattering effect by treating the display as a piece of homogeneous scattering medium. With the physical model of the scattering effect, we improve the image formation pipeline for the image synthesis to construct a realistic UDC dataset with ground truths. To suppress the scattering effect for the eventual UDC image recovery, a two-branch restoration network is designed. More specifically, the scattering branch leverages global modeling capabilities of the channel-wise self-attention to estimate parameters of the scattering effect from degraded images. While the image branch exploits the local representation advantage of CNN to recover clear scenes, implicitly guided by the scattering branch.

Naively fine-tuning the old model on new data leads to catastrophic forgetting. A common solution is knowledge distillation (KD), where the output distribution of the new model is regularized to be similar to that of the old model. However, in CSS, this is challenging because of the background shift issue. Existing KD-based CSS methods continue to suffer from confusion between the background and novel classes since they fail to establish a reliable class correspondence for distillation. To address this issue, we propose a new label-guided knowledge distillation (LGKD) loss, where the old model output is expanded and transplanted (with the guidance of the ground truth label) to form a semantically appropriate class correspondence with the new model output. Consequently, the useful knowledge from the old model can be effectively distilled into the new model without causing confusion. We conduct extensive experiments on two prevailing CSS benchmarks, Pascal-VOC and ADE20K, where our LGKD significantly boosts the performance of three competing methods, especially on novel mIoU by up to +76%, setting new state-of-the-art. Finally, to further demonstrate its generalization ability, we introduce the first CSS benchmark for 3D point cloud based on ScanNet, along with several re-implemented baselines for comparison.

The greater degree-of-freedom of planar objects compared with common objects makes MPOT far more challenging than well-studied object tracking, especially when occlusion occurs. To address this challenging task, we are inspired by amodal perception that humans jointly track visible and invisible parts of the target, and propose a tracking framework that unifies appearance perception and occlusion reasoning. Specifically, we present a dual-branch network to track the visible part of planar objects, including vertexes and mask. Then, we develop an occlusion area localization strategy to infer the invisible part, i.e., the occluded region, followed by a two-stream attention network finally refining the prediction.

Such promise and potential of event cameras and NeRF inspired recent works to investigate on the reconstruction of NeRF from moving event cameras.

In this paper, we explore Multi-Modal Continual Test-Time Adaptation (MM-CTTA) as a new extension of CTTA for 3D semantic segmentation. The key to MM-CTTA is to adaptively attend to the reliable modality while avoiding catastrophic forgetting during continual domain shifts, which is out of the capability of previous TTA or CTTA methods. To fulfill this gap, we propose an MM-CTTA method called Continual Cross-Modal Adaptive Clustering (CoMAC) that addresses this task from two perspectives.

Early efforts focus on boosting the performance for only one task, e.g., fusion or segmentation, making it hard to reach `Best of Both Worlds'. To overcome this issue, in this paper, we propose a Multi-interactive Feature learning architecture for image fusion and segmentation, namely SegMiF, and exploit dual-task correlation to promote the performance of both tasks. The SegMiF is of a cascade structure, containing a fusion sub-network and a commonly used segmentation sub-network. By slickly bridging intermediate features between two components, the knowledge learned from the segmentation task can effectively assist the fusion task. Also, the benefited fusion network supports the segmentation one to perform more pretentiously. Besides, a hierarchical interactive attention block is established to ensure fine-grained mapping of all the vital information between two tasks, so that the modality/semantic features can be fully mutual-interactive. In addition, a dynamic weight factor is introduced to automatically adjust the corresponding weights of each task, which can balance the interactive feature correspondence and break through the limitation of laborious tuning.

This task requires the model to effectively summarize the target videos and accurately describe the distinguishing content compared to the reference videos, and it becomes more difficult as the video length increases. To solve this problem, 1) First, we propose an efficient relational approximation (ERA) to identify the shared content among videos while the complexity is linearly related to the number of videos. 2) Then, we introduce a contextual feature refinery with intra-group self-supervision to capture the contextual information and further refine the common properties. 3) In addition, we construct two group video captioning datasets derived from the YouCook2 and the ActivityNet Captions.

However, both the class-agnostic proposal generator and the classifier are biased to the seen classes as demonstrated by the gaps of objectness and accuracy assessment between base and novel classes. In this paper, an open corpus, composed of a set of external object concepts and clustered to several centroids, is introduced to improve the generalization ability in the detector. We propose the generalized objectness assessment (GOAT) in the proposal generator based on the visual-text alignment, where the similarities of visual feature to the cluster centroids are summarized as the objectness. This simple heuristic evaluates objectness with concepts in open corpus and is thus generalized to open categories. We further propose category expanding (CE) with open corpus in two training tasks, which enables the detector to perceive more categories in the feature space and get more reasonable optimization direction. For the classification task, we introduce an open corpus classifier by reconstructing original classifier with similar words in text space. For the image-caption alignment task, the open corpus centroids are incorporated to enlarge the negative samples in the contrastive loss.

Such an ability of precise perception is essential for driver's planning. To achieve this, a geometry-aware representation that quantizes the physical 3D scene into structured grid map with semantic labels per cell, termed as 3D Occupancy, would be desirable. Compared to the form of bounding box, a key insight behind occupancy is that it could capture the fine-grained details of critical obstacles in the scene, and thereby facilitate subsequent tasks. Prior or concurrent literature mainly concentrate on a single scene completion task, where we might argue that the potential of this occupancy representation might obsess broader impact. In this paper, we propose OccNet, a multi-view vision centric pipeline with a cascade and temporal voxel decoder to reconstruct 3D occupancy. At the core of OccNet is a general occupancy embedding to represent 3D physical world. Such a descriptor could be applied towards a wide span of driving tasks, including detection, segmentation and planning. To validate the effectiveness of this new representation and our proposed algorithm, we propose OpenOcc, the first dense high-quality 3D occupancy benchmark built on top of nuScenes.

This shortcoming poses a significant challenge in processing complex and variable geo-objects, which results in semantic inconsistency in segmentation results. To address this challenge, we propose a dynamic scale perception framework, named GeoAgent, which adaptively captures appropriate scale context information outside the image patch based on the different geo-objects. In GeoAgent, each image patch's states are represented by a global thumbnail and a location mask. The global thumbnail provides context beyond the patch, and the location mask guides the perceived spatial relationships. The scale-selection actions are performed through a Scale Control Agent (SCA). A feature indexing module is proposed to enhance the ability of the agent to distinguish the current image patch's location. The action switches the patch scale and context branch of a dual-branch segmentation network that extracts and fuses the features of multi-scale patches. The GeoAgent adjusts the network parameters to perform the appropriate scale-selection action based on the reward received for the selected scale. The experimental results, using two publicly available datasets and our newly constructed dataset WUSU, demonstrate that GeoAgent outperforms previous segmentation methods, particularly for large-scale mapping applications.",True,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/papers/Lee_Online_Continual_Learning_on_Hierarchical_Label_Expansion_ICCV_2023_paper.pdf

However, the study of NeRF on large-scale outdoor scene reconstruction is still limited, as there is no unified outdoor scene dataset for large-scale NeRF evaluation due to expensive data acquisition and calibration costs. 
  In this work, we propose a large-scale outdoor multi-modal dataset, OMMO dataset, containing complex objects and scenes with calibrated images, point clouds and prompt annotations.

To complement the lack of 3D information, depth-based models, such as DSNeRF and MonoSDF, explicitly assume the availability of accurate depth maps of multiple views. They linearly scale the accurate depth maps as supervision to guide the predicted depth of few-shot NeRFs. However, accurate depth maps are difficult and expensive to capture due to wide-range depth distances in the wild. 
 
 This work presents a new Sparse-view NeRF (SparseNeRF) framework that exploits depth priors from real-world inaccurate observations. The inaccurate depth observations are either from pre-trained depth models or coarse depth maps of consumer-level depth sensors. Since coarse depth maps are not strictly scaled to the ground-truth depth maps, we propose a simple yet effective constraint, a local depth ranking method, on NeRFs such that the expected depth ranking of the NeRF is consistent with that of the coarse depth maps in local patches. To preserve the spatial continuity of the estimated depth of NeRF, we further propose a spatial continuity constraint to encourage the consistency of the expected depth continuity of NeRF with coarse depth maps. Surprisingly, with simple depth ranking constraints, SparseNeRF outperforms all state-of-the-art few-shot NeRF methods (including depth-based models) on standard LLFF and DTU datasets. Moreover, we collect a new dataset NVS-RGBD that contains real-world depth maps from Azure Kinect, ZED 2, and iPhone 13 Pro.

Specifically, given a text input, we automatically generate several question-answer pairs using a language model. We calculate image faithfulness by checking whether existing VQA models can answer these questions using the generated image. TIFA is a reference-free metric that allows for fine-grained and interpretable evaluations of generated images.TIFA also has better correlations with human judgments than existing metrics.

Regarding the growing nature of real-world data, such an offline training paradigm on ever-expanding data is unsustainable, because models lack the continual learning ability to accumulate knowledge constantly. However, most continual learning studies are limited to uni-modal classification and existing multi-modal datasets cannot simulate continual non-stationary data stream scenarios. To support the study of Vision-Language Continual Pretraining (VLCP), we first contribute a comprehensive and unified benchmark dataset P9D which contains over one million product image-text pairs from 9 industries. The data from each industry as an independent task supports continual learning and conforms to the real-world long-tail nature to simulate pretraining on web data.

Kim","Video Question Answering (VideoQA) is a challenging task that entails complex multi-modal reasoning. In contrast to multiple-choice VideoQA which aims to predict the answer given several options, the goal of open-ended VideoQA is to answer questions without restricting candidate answers. However, the majority of previous VideoQA models formulate open-ended VideoQA as a classification task to classify the video-question pairs into a fixed answer set, i.e., closed-vocabulary, which contains only frequent answers (e.g., top-1000 answers). This leads the model to be biased toward only frequent answers and fail to generalize on out-of-vocabulary answers. We hence propose a new benchmark, Open-vocabulary Video Question Answering (OVQA), to measure the generalizability of VideoQA models by considering rare and unseen answers. In addition, in order to improve the model's generalization power, we introduce a novel GNN-based soft verbalizer that enhances the prediction on rare and unseen answers by aggregating the information from their similar words. For evaluation, we introduce new baselines by modifying the existing (closed-vocabulary) open-ended VideoQA models and improve their performances by further taking into account rare and unseen answers.

In this work, we introduce the challenging problem of predicting collisions in diverse environments from multi-view egocentric videos captured from body-mounted cameras. Solving this problem requires a generalizable perception system that can classify which human body joints will collide and estimate a collision region heatmap to localize collisions in the environment. To achieve this, we propose a transformer-based model called COPILOT to perform collision prediction and localization simultaneously, which accumulates information across multi-view inputs through a novel 4D space-time-viewpoint attention mechanism. To train our model and enable future research on this task, we develop a synthetic data generation framework that produces egocentric videos of virtual humans moving and colliding within diverse 3D environments. This framework is then used to establish a large-scale dataset consisting of 8.6M egocentric RGBD frames.

Several attempts have compensated for the loss of motion information by using event cameras, which are bio-inspired sensors with a high temporal resolution. Even though most studies have assumed that image and event data are pixel-wise aligned, this is only possible with low-quality active-pixel sensor (APS) images and synthetic datasets. In real scenarios, obtaining per-pixel aligned event-RGB data is technically challenging since event and frame cameras have different optical axes. For the application of the event camera, we propose the first Non-coaxial Event-guided Image Deblurring (NEID) approach that utilizes the camera setup composed of a standard frame-based camera with a non-coaxial single event camera. To consider the per-pixel alignment between the image and event without additional devices, we propose the first NEID network that spatially aligns events to images while refining the image features from temporally dense event features.

Existing large-scale 3D perception datasets often contain data that are meticulously cleaned. Such configurations, however, cannot reflect the reliability of perception models during the deployment stage. In this work, we present Robo3D, the first comprehensive benchmark heading toward probing the robustness of 3D detectors and segmentors under out-of-distribution scenarios against natural corruptions that occur in real-world environments. Specifically, we consider eight corruption types stemming from severe weather conditions, external disturbances, and internal sensor failure. We uncover that, although promising results have been progressively achieved on standard benchmarks, state-of-the-art 3D perception models are at risk of being vulnerable to corruptions. We draw key observations on the use of data representations, augmentation schemes, and training strategies, that could severely affect the model's performance.

Different from human behaviors in daily life, human behaviors in chaotic events are generally different in how they behave and influence others, and hence are often much more complex. However, currently there is lack of a large video dataset for analyzing human behaviors in chaotic situations. To this end, we create the first large and challenging multi-modal dataset, Chaotic World, that simultaneously provides different levels of fine-grained and dense spatio-temporal annotations of sounds, individual actions and group interaction graphs, and even text descriptions for each scene in each video, thereby enabling a thorough analysis of complicated behaviors in crowds and chaos. Our dataset consists of a total of 299,923 annotated instances for detecting human behaviors for Spatiotemporal Action Localization in chaotic events, 224,275 instances for identifying interactions between people for Behavior Graph Analysis in chaotic events, 336,390 instances for localizing relevant scenes of interest in long videos for Spatiotemporal Event Grounding, and 378,093 instances for triangulating the source of sound for Event Sound Source Localization. Given the practical complexity and challenges in chaotic events (e.g., large crowds, serious occlusions, complicated interaction patterns), our dataset shall be able to facilitate the community to develop, adapt, and evaluate various types of advanced models for analyzing human behaviors in chaotic events. We also design a simple yet effective IntelliCare model with a Dynamic Knowledge Pathfinder module that intelligently learns from multiple tasks and can analyze various aspects of a chaotic scene in a unified architecture.

A major challenge for accurate glaucoma detection and progression forecasting is the bottleneck of limited labeled patients with the state-of-the-art (SOTA) 3D retinal imaging data of optical coherence tomography (OCT). To address the data scarcity issue, this paper proposes two solutions. First, we develop a novel generalization-reinforced semi-supervised learning (SSL) model called pseudo supervisor to optimally utilize unlabeled data. Compared with SOTA models, the proposed pseudo supervisor optimizes the policy of predicting pseudo labels with unlabeled samples to improve empirical generalization. Our pseudo supervisor model is evaluated with two clinical tasks consisting of glaucoma detection and progression forecasting. The progression forecasting task is evaluated both unimodally and multimodally. Our pseudo supervisor model demonstrates superior performance than SOTA SSL comparison models. Moreover, our model also achieves the best results on the publicly available LAG fun- dus dataset. Second, we introduce the Harvard Glaucoma Detection and Progression (Harvard-GDP) Dataset, a multimodal multitask dataset that includes data from 1,000 patients with OCT imaging data, as well as labels for glaucoma detection and progression.

EmoSet includes images from social networks, as well as artistic images, and it is well balanced between different emotion categories. Motivated by psychological studies, in addition to emotion category, each image is also annotated with a set of describable emotion attributes: brightness, colorfulness, scene type, object class, facial expression, and human action, which can help understand visual emotions in a precise and interpretable way. The relevance of these emotion attributes is validated by analyzing the correlations between them and visual emotion, as well as by designing an attribute module to help visual emotion recognition.

In this paper, we propose a neural rendering and pose estimation system for hand-object interaction from sparse views, which can also enable 3D hand-object interaction editing. We share the inspiration from recent scene understanding work that shows a scene specific model built beforehand can significantly improve and unblock vision tasks especially when inputs are sparse, and extend it to the dynamic hand-object interaction scenario and propose to solve the problem in two stages. We first learn the shape and appearance prior knowledge of hands and objects separately with the neural representation at the offline stage. During the online stage, we design a rendering-based joint model fitting framework to understand the dynamic hand-object interaction with the pre-built hand and object models as well as interaction priors, which thereby overcomes penetration and separation issues between hand and object and also enables novel view synthesis.

It has been recently recognized that such degradations encode temporal information, which can be exploited for video frame interpolation (VFI), a more challenging task than pure restoration. However, these VFI researches are mainly grounded on experiments with synthetic data, rather than real data. More fundamentally, under the same imaging condition, it remains unknown which degradation will be more effective toward VFI. In this paper, we present the first real-world dataset for learning and benchmark degraded video frame interpolation, named RD-VFI, and further explore the performance differences of three types of degradations, including GS blur, RS distortion, and
 an in-between effect caused by the rolling shutter with global reset (RSGR), thanks to our novel quad-axis imaging system. Moreover, we propose a unified Progressive Mutual Boosting Network (PMBNet) model to interpolate middle frames at arbitrary times for all shutter modes.

Nevertheless, during the continual training of the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model, we observe that the model's zero-shot transfer ability significantly degrades due to catastrophic forgetting. Existing CL methods can mitigate forgetting by replaying previous data. However, since the CLIP dataset is private, replay methods cannot access the pre-training dataset. In addition, replaying data of previously learned downstream tasks can enhance their performance but comes at the cost of sacrificing zero-shot performance. To address this challenge, we propose a novel method ZSCL to prevent zero-shot transfer degradation in the continual learning of vision-language models in both feature and parameter space. In the feature space, a reference dataset is introduced for distillation between the current and initial models. The reference dataset should have semantic diversity but no need to be labeled, seen in pre-training, or matched image-text pairs. In parameter space, we prevent a large parameter shift by averaging weights during the training.

Determiners, as an important word class, are a type of schema in natural language about the reference or quantity of the noun.

These disparities have been shown to exist, but until now there has not been a unified approach to measure these differences for common use-cases of computer vision models. We present a new benchmark named FACET (FAirness in Computer Vision EvaluaTion), a large, publicly available evaluation set of 32k images for some of the most common vision tasks - image classification, object detection and segmentation. For every image in FACET, we hired expert reviewers to manually annotate person-related attributes such as perceived skin tone and hair type, manually draw bounding boxes and label fine-grained person-related classes such as disk jockey or guitarist.

These artifacts can importantly affect image visual quality and downstream computer vision tasks. While collecting real data pairs of flare-corrupted/flare-free images for training flare removal models is challenging, current methods utilize the direct-add approach to synthesize data. 
 However, these methods do not consider automatic exposure and tone mapping in image signal processing pipeline (ISP), leading to the limited generalization capability of deep models training using such data. Besides, existing methods struggle to handle multiple light sources due to the different sizes, shapes and illuminance of various light sources. In this paper, we propose a solution to improve the performance of lens flare removal by revisiting the ISP and remodeling the principle of automatic exposure in the synthesis pipeline and design a more reliable light sources recovery strategy. The new pipeline approaches realistic imaging by discriminating the local and global illumination through convex combination, avoiding global illumination shifting and local over-saturation. Our strategy for recovering multiple light sources convexly averages the input and output of the neural network based on illuminance levels, thereby avoiding the need for a hard threshold in identifying light sources.

The challenges of this task lie in the complexity of the scenes, the unique features of anime style, and the lack of high-quality datasets to bridge the domain gap. Despite promising attempts, previous efforts are still incompetent in achieving satisfactory results with consistent semantic preservation, evident stylization, and fine details. In this study, we propose Scenimefy, a novel semi-supervised image-to-image translation framework that addresses these challenges. Our approach guides the learning with structure-consistent pseudo paired data, simplifying the pure unsupervised setting. The pseudo data are derived uniquely from a semantic-constrained StyleGAN leveraging rich model priors like CLIP. We further apply segmentation-guided data selection to obtain high-quality pseudo supervision. A patch-wise contrastive style loss is introduced to improve stylization and fine details.

To endow deep networks with such ability, we address the challenge of dense indoor prediction with sound in both 2D and 3D via cross-modal knowledge distillation. In this work, we propose a Spatial Alignment via Matching (SAM) distillation framework that elicits local correspondence between the two modalities in vision-to-audio knowledge transfer. SAM integrates audio features with visually coherent learnable spatial embeddings to resolve inconsistencies in multiple layers of a student model. Our approach does not rely on a specific input representation, allowing for flexibility in the input shapes or dimensions without performance degradation. With a newly curated benchmark named Dense Auditory Prediction of Surroundings (DAPS), we are the first to tackle dense indoor prediction of omnidirectional surroundings in both 2D and 3D with audio observations.

Unfortunately, they have two major drawbacks. First, they may compromise temporal dynamics in input videos, which are critical for accurate action recognition. Second, they are vulnerable to practical attacking scenarios where attackers probe for privacy from an entire video rather than individual frames. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework STPrivacy to perform video-level PPAR. For the first time, we introduce vision Transformers into PPAR by treating a video as a tubelet sequence, and accordingly design two complementary mechanisms, i.e., sparsification and anonymization, to remove privacy from a spatio-temporal perspective. In specific, our privacy sparsification mechanism applies adaptive token selection to abandon action-irrelevant tubelets. Then, our anonymization mechanism implicitly manipulates the remaining action-tubelets to erase privacy in the embedding space through adversarial learning. These mechanisms provide significant advantages in terms of privacy preservation for human eyes and action-privacy trade-off adjustment during deployment.

For example, slicing a cucumber changes its state from whole to sliced. Learning about object state changes in Video Object Segmentation (VOS) is crucial for understanding and interacting with the visual world. Conventional VOS benchmarks do not consider this challenging yet crucial problem. This paper makes a pioneering effort to introduce a weakly-supervised benchmark on Video State-Changing Object Segmentation (VSCOS). We construct our VSCOS benchmark by selecting state-changing videos from existing datasets. In advocate of an annotation-efficient approach towards state-changing object segmentation, we only annotate the first and last frames of training videos, which is different from conventional VOS. Notably, an open-vocabulary setting is included to evaluate the generalization to novel types of objects or state changes. We empirically illustrate that state-of-the-art VOS models struggle with state-changing objects and lose track after the state changes. We analyze the main difficulties of our VSCOS task and identify three technical improvements, namely, fine-tuning strategies, representation learning, and integrating motion information. Applying these improvements results in a strong baseline for segmenting state-changing objects consistently.

Current approaches for generating such datasets either employ synthetic data or generate images with limited realism. However, the domain gap of these data with real-world scenes constrains the generalization of the trained model to real-world applications. To address this issue, we investigate generating realistic optical flow datasets from real-world images. Firstly, to generate highly realistic new images, we construct a layered depth representation, known as multiplane images (MPI), from single-view images. This allows us to generate novel view images that are highly realistic. To generate optical flow maps that correspond accurately to the new image, we calculate the optical flows of each plane using the camera matrix and plane depths. We then project these layered optical flows into the output optical flow map with volume rendering. Secondly, to ensure the realism of motion, we present an independent object motion module that can separate the camera and dynamic object motion in MPI. This module addresses the deficiency in MPI-based single-view methods, where optical flow is generated only by camera motion and does not account for any object movement. We additionally devise a depth-aware inpainting module to merge new images with dynamic objects and address unnatural motion occlusions. We show the superior performance of our method through extensive experiments on real-world datasets. Moreover, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in both unsupervised and supervised training of learning-based models.

An emerging alternative is to use synthetic data, but if the synthetic data is not similar enough to the real data, the performance is typically below that of training with real data. Thus using synthetic data still requires a large amount of time, money, and skill as one needs to author the data carefully. In this paper, we seek to understand which aspects of this authoring process are most critical. We present an analysis of which factors of variation between simulated and real data are most important. We capture images of YCB objects to create a novel YCB-Real dataset. We then create a novel synthetic ""digital twin"" dataset, YCB-Synthetic, which matches the YCB-Real dataset and includes variety of artifacts added to the synthetic data. We study the affects of these artifacts on our dataset and two existing published datasets on two different computer vision tasks: object detection and instance segmentation.

This assumption has endured, even as recent works have increasingly focused on real-time methods for mobile devices. However, the assumption of a fixed pose for each image does not hold for online execution: poses from real-time SLAM are dynamic and may be updated following events such as bundle adjustment and loop closure. This has been addressed in the RGB-D setting, by de-integrating past views and re-integrating them with updated poses, but it remains largely untreated in the RGB-only setting. We formalize this problem to define the new task of dense online reconstruction from dynamically-posed images. To support further research, we introduce a dataset called LivePose containing the dynamic poses from a SLAM system running on ScanNet. We select three recent reconstruction systems and apply a framework based on de-integration to adapt each one to the dynamic-pose setting. In addition, we propose a novel, non-linear de-integration module that learns to remove stale scene content.

However, existing OVS techniques confront a fundamental challenge: the trained classifier tends to overfit on the base classes observed during training, resulting in suboptimal generalization performance to unseen classes. To mitigate this issue, recent studies have proposed the use of an additional frozen pre-trained CLIP for classification. Nonetheless, this approach incurs heavy computational overheads as the CLIP vision encoder must be repeatedly forward-passed for each mask, rendering it impractical for real-world applications. To address this challenge, our objective is to develop a fast OVS model that can perform comparably or better without the extra computational burden of the CLIP image encoder during inference. To this end, we propose a core idea of preserving the generalizable representation when fine-tuning on known classes. Specifically, we introduce a text diversification strategy that generates a set of synonyms for each training category, which prevents the learned representation from collapsing onto specific known category names. Additionally, we employ a text-guided knowledge distillation method to preserve the generalizable knowledge of CLIP.

Unlike existing methods, the core idea of this work is to incorporate more informative Raw sensor data to generate HDR images, aiming to recover scene information in hard regions (the darkest and brightest areas of an HDR scene). We propose a model customized for Raw images, considering the unique feature of Raw data to learn the Raw-to-HDR mapping.

To reduce memory usage and search complexity, we take a coarse-to-fine approach where we extract patch-level features from 2D images, then perform 2D patch classification on each 3D point, and obtain the exact corresponding 2D pixel coordinates through positional encoding. Finally, for the first time in this task, we employ a differentiable PnP for end-to-end training. In the experiments on newly curated large-scale indoor and outdoor benchmarks based on 2D-3D-S and KITTI, we show that our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance compared to existing visual localization and image-to-point cloud registration methods.",True,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/papers/Wang_SpaceEvo_Hardware-Friendly_Search_Space_Design_for_Efficient_INT8_Inference_ICCV_2023_paper.pdf

However, current works mainly focus on synthesizing realistic visual outputs, often ignoring other sensory modalities, such as touch, which limits physical interaction with users. In this work, we leverage deep generative models to create a multi-sensory experience where users can touch and see the synthesized object when sliding their fingers on a haptic surface. The main challenges lie in the significant scale discrepancy between vision and touch sensing and the lack of explicit mapping from touch sensing data to a haptic rendering device. To bridge this gap, we collect high-resolution tactile data with a GelSight sensor and create a new visuotactile clothing dataset. We then develop a conditional generative model that synthesizes both visual and tactile outputs from a single sketch. We evaluate our method regarding image quality and tactile rendering accuracy.

In this paper, we seek to build a detector for telling apart real images from diffusion-generated images. We find that existing detectors struggle to detect images generated by diffusion models, even if we include generated images from a specific diffusion model in their training data. To address this issue, we propose a novel image representation called DIffusion Reconstruction Error (DIRE), which measures the error between an input image and its reconstruction counterpart by a pre-trained diffusion model. We observe that diffusion-generated images can be approximately reconstructed by a diffusion model while real images cannot. It provides a hint that DIRE can serve as a bridge to distinguish generated and real images. DIRE provides an effective way to detect images generated by most diffusion models, and it is general for detecting generated images from unseen diffusion models and robust to various perturbations. Furthermore, we establish a comprehensive diffusion-generated benchmark including images generated by eight diffusion models to evaluate the performance of diffusion-generated image detectors. Extensive experiments on our collected benchmark demonstrate that DIRE exhibits superiority over previous generated-image detectors.

Therefore, we can extract the degradation representation of an image from the low-quality and recovered face pairs. Using the degradation representation, realistic low-quality images can then be synthesized to fine-tune the super-resolution model for the real-world low-quality image. However, such a procedure is time-consuming and laborious, and the gaps between recovered faces and the ground-truths further increase the optimization uncertainty. To facilitate efficient model adaptation towards image-specific degradations, we propose a method dubbed MetaF2N, which leverages the contained faces to fine-tune model parameters for adapting to the whole natural image in a meta-learning framework. The degradation extraction and low-quality image synthesis steps are thus circumvented in our MetaF2N, and it requires only one fine-tuning step to get decent performance. Considering the gaps between the recovered faces and ground-truths, we further deploy a MaskNet for adaptively predicting loss weights at different positions to reduce the impact of low-confidence areas. To evaluate our proposed MetaF2N, we have collected a real-world low-quality dataset with one or multiple faces in each image, and our MetaF2N achieves superior performance on both synthetic and realworld datasets.

The existing pixel-based crack segmentation methods rely on time-consuming and costly pixel-level annotations. And the object-based crack detection methods exploit the horizontal box to detect the crack without considering crack orientation, resulting in scale variation and intra-class variation. Considering this, we provide a new perspective for crack detection that models the cracks as a series of sub-cracks with the corresponding orientation. However, the vanilla adaptation of the existing oriented object detection methods to the crack detection tasks will result in limited performance, due to the boundary discontinuity issue and the ambiguities in sub-crack orientation. In this paper, we propose a first-of-its-kind oriented sub-crack detector, dubbed as CrackDet, which is derived from a novel piecewise angle definition, to ease the boundary discontinuity problem.

The state-of-the-art VOS methods have achieved excellent performance (e.g., 90+% J&F) on existing datasets. However, since the target objects in these existing datasets are usually relatively salient, dominant, and isolated, VOS under complex scenes has rarely been studied. To revisit VOS and make it more applicable in the real world, we collect a new VOS dataset called coMplex video Object SEgmentation (MOSE) to study the tracking and segmenting objects in complex environments. MOSE contains 2,149 video clips and 5,200 objects from 36 categories, with 431,725 high-quality object segmentation masks. The most notable feature of MOSE dataset is complex scenes with crowded and occluded objects. The target objects in the videos are commonly occluded by others and disappear in some frames. To analyze the proposed MOSE dataset, we benchmark 18 existing VOS methods under 4 different settings on the proposed MOSE dataset and conduct comprehensive comparisons. The experiments show that current VOS algorithms cannot well perceive objects in complex scenes. For example, under the semi-supervised VOS setting, the highest J&F by existing state-of-the-art VOS methods is only 59.4% on MOSE, much lower than their  90% J&F performance on DAVIS.

This allows VLMs to generalize better to nuanced and unseen multimodal compositions. However, modeling equivariance is challenging as the ground truth of semantic change is difficult to collect. For example, given an image-text pair about a dog, it is unclear to what extent the similarity changes when the pixel is changed from dog to cat? To this end, we propose EqSim, a regularization loss that can be efficiently calculated from any two matched training pairs and easily pluggable into existing image-text retrieval fine-tuning.

However, recent works have uncovered a fundamental weakness of these models. For example, their difficulty to understand Visual Language Concepts (VLC) that go 'beyond nouns' such as the meaning of non-object words (e.g., attributes, actions, relations, states, etc.), or difficulty in performing compositional reasoning such as understanding the significance of the order of the words in a sentence. In this work, we investigate to which extent purely synthetic data could be leveraged to teach these models to overcome such shortcomings without compromising their zero-shot capabilities. We contribute Synthetic Visual Concepts (SyViC) - a million-scale synthetic dataset and data generation codebase allowing to generate additional suitable data to improve VLC understanding and compositional reasoning of VL models. Additionally, we propose a general VL finetuning strategy for effectively leveraging SyViC towards achieving these improvements. Our extensive experiments and ablations on VL-Checklist, Winoground, and ARO benchmarks demonstrate that it is possible to adapt strong pre-trained VL models with synthetic data significantly enhancing their VLC understanding (e.g. by 9.9% on ARO and 4.3% on VL-Checklist) with under 1% drop in their zero-shot accuracy.",True,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/papers/Rozumnyi_Tracking_by_3D_Model_Estimation_of_Unknown_Objects_in_Videos_ICCV_2023_paper.pdf

Kim","The quad-Bayer patterned image sensor has made significant improvements in spatial resolution over recent years due to advancements in image sensor technology. This has enabled single-shot high-dynamic-range (HDR) imaging using spatially varying multiple exposures. Popular methods for multi-exposure array sensors involve varying the gain of each exposure, but this does not effectively change the photoelectronic energy in each exposure. Consequently, HDR images produced using gain-based exposure variation may suffer from noise and details being saturated. To address this problem, we intend to use time-varying exposures in quad-Bayer patterned sensors. This approach allows long-exposure pixels to receive more photon energy than short- or middle-exposure pixels, resulting in higher-quality HDR images. However, time-varying exposures are not ideal for dynamic scenes and require an additional deghosting method. To tackle this issue, we propose a single-shot HDR demosaicing method that takes time-varying multiple exposures as input and jointly solves both the demosaicing and deghosting problems. Our method uses a feature-extraction module to handle mosaiced multiple exposures and a multiscale transformer module to register spatial displacements of multiple exposures and colors. We also created a dataset of quad-Bayer sensor input with time-varying exposures and trained our network using this dataset. Results demonstrate that our method outperforms baseline HDR reconstruction methods with both synthetic and real datasets. With our method, we can achieve high-quality HDR images in challenging lighting conditions.",True,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/papers/Li_Tube-Link_A_Flexible_Cross_Tube_Framework_for_Universal_Video_Segmentation_ICCV_2023_paper.pdf

There have been efforts to use semantic information for scene completion. However, the completed shapes may be rough and imprecise since respective methods rely on 3D convolution and/or lack effective shape constraints. To overcome these limitations, we propose a semantic scene completion method based on deformable deep implicit templates (DDIT). Specifically, we complete each segmented instance in a scene by deforming a template with a latent code. Such a template is expressed by a deep implicit function in the canonical frame. It abstracts the shape prior of a category, and thus can provide constraints on the overall shape of an instance. Latent code controls the deformation of template to guarantee fine details of an instance. For code prediction, we design a neural network that leverages both intra- and inter-instance information. We also introduce an algorithm to transform instances between the world and canonical frames based on geometric constraints and a hierarchical tree. To further improve accuracy, we jointly optimize the latent code and transformation by enforcing the zero-valued isosurface constraint. In addition, we establish a new dataset to solve different problems of existing datasets.

However, legal and ethical concerns led to the recent retraction of many of these databases by their creators, raising questions about the continuity of future face recognition research without one of its key resources. Synthetic datasets have emerged as a promising alternative to privacy-sensitive authentic data for face recognition development. However, recent synthetic datasets that are used to train face recognition models suffer either from limitations in intra-class diversity or cross-class (identity) discrimination, leading to less optimal accuracies, far away from the accuracies achieved by models trained on authentic data. This paper targets this issue by proposing IDiff-Face, a novel approach based on conditional latent diffusion models for synthetic identity generation with realistic identity variations for face recognition training. Through extensive evaluations, our proposed synthetic-based face recognition approach pushed the limits of state-of-the-art performances, achieving, for example, 98.00% accuracy on the Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) benchmark, far ahead from the recent synthetic-based face recognition solutions with 95.40% and bridging the gap to authentic-based face recognition with 99.82% accuracy.",True,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/papers/Corona-Figueroa_Unaligned_2D_to_3D_Translation_with_Conditional_Vector-Quantized_Code_Diffusion_ICCV_2023_paper.pdf

To this end, we propose the task of joint 3D human semantic segmentation, instance segmentation and multi-human body-part segmentation. Few works have attempted to directly segment humans in cluttered 3D scenes, which is largely due to the lack of annotated training data of humans interacting with 3D scenes. We address this challenge and propose a framework for generating training data of synthetic humans interacting with real 3D scenes. Furthermore, we propose a novel transformer-based model, Human3D, which is the first end-to-end model for segmenting multiple human instances and their body-parts in a unified manner. The key advantage of our synthetic data generation framework is its ability to generate diverse and realistic human-scene interactions, with highly accurate ground truth. Our experiments show that pre-training on synthetic data improves performance on a wide variety of 3D human segmentation tasks.

However, existing methods often neglect emotional facial expressions or fail to disentangle them from speech content. To address this issue, this paper proposes an end-to-end neural network to disentangle different emotions in speech so as to generate rich 3D facial expressions. Specifically, we introduce the emotion disentangling encoder (EDE) to disentangle the emotion and content in the speech by cross-reconstructed speech signals with different emotion labels. Then an emotion-guided feature fusion decoder is employed to generate a 3D talking face with enhanced emotion. The decoder is driven by the disentangled identity, emotional, and content embeddings so as to generate controllable personal and emotional styles. Finally, considering the scarcity of the 3D emotional talking face data, we resort to the supervision of facial blendshapes, which enables the reconstruction of plausible 3D faces from 2D emotional data, and contribute a large-scale 3D emotional talking face dataset (3D-ETF) to train the network.

However, existing image classification benchmarks often evaluate recognition on a specific domain (e.g., outdoor images) or a specific task (e.g., classifying plant species), which falls short of evaluating whether pre-trained foundational models are universal visual recognizers. To address this, we formally present the task of Open-domain Visual Entity recognitioN (OVEN), where a model need to link an image onto a Wikipedia entity with respect to a text query. We construct OVEN by re-purposing 14 existing datasets with all labels grounded onto one single label space: Wikipedia entities. OVEN challenges models to select among six million possible Wikipedia entities, making it a general visual recognition benchmark with largest number of labels. Our study on state-of-the-art pre-trained models reveals large headroom in generalizing to the massive-scale label space. We show that a PaLI-based auto-regressive visual recognition model performs surprisingly well, even on Wikipedia entities that have never been seen during fine-tuning.

Recently, some training-free approaches have presented various MQ proxies and significantly improve search efficiency. However, the correlation between these proxies and quantization accuracy is poorly understood. To address the gap, we first build the MQ-Bench-101, which involves different bit configurations and quantization results. Then, we observe that the existing training-free proxies perform weak correlations on the MQ-Bench-101.

This study empirically investigates the latter and expands the understanding of frequency shortcuts. First, we perform experiments on synthetic datasets, designed to have a bias in different frequency bands. Our results demonstrate that NNs tend to find simple solutions for classification, and what they learn first during training depends on the most distinctive frequency characteristics, which can be either low- or high-frequencies. Second, we confirm this phenomenon on natural images. We propose a metric to measure class-wise frequency characteristics and a method to identify frequency shortcuts. The results show that frequency shortcuts can be texture-based or shape-based, depending on what best simplifies the objective. Third, we validate the transferability of frequency shortcuts on out-of-distribution (OOD) test sets.

We describe how our idea can be used with existing image formats by embedding the estimated distribution in the RAW image to enable users to generate visually plausible white-balance images.",True,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/papers/Chen_WDiscOOD_Out-of-Distribution_Detection_via_Whitened_Linear_Discriminant_Analysis_ICCV_2023_paper.pdf

It contains 221k unique question+answer pairs each matched with (up to) 5 images, resulting in a total of 1M VQA samples. Moreover, our dataset comes with a controlled knowledge base derived from Wikipedia, marking the evidence to support each answer. Empirically, we show that our dataset poses a hard challenge for large vision+language models as they perform poorly on our dataset: PaLI [9] is state-of-the-art on OK-VQA [29], yet it only achieves 13.0% accuracy on our dataset. Moreover, we experimentally show that progress on answering our encyclopedic questions can be achieved by augmenting large models with a mechanism that retrieves relevant information for the knowledge base. An oracle experiment with perfect retrieval achieves 87.0% accuracy on the single-hop portion of our dataset, and an automatic retrieval-
 augmented prototype yields 48.8%. We believe that our dataset enables future research on retrieval-augmented vision+language models.",True,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/papers/Lian_WaterMask_Instance_Segmentation_for_Underwater_Imagery_ICCV_2023_paper.pdf
ICCV-2023-2117,ICCV,2023,Achievement-Based Training Progress Balancing for Multi-Task Learning,"Hayoung Yun, Hanjoo Cho","Multi-task learning faces two challenging issues: (1) the high cost of annotating labels for all tasks and (2) balancing the training progress of various tasks with different natures. To resolve the label annotation issue, we construct a large-scale ""partially annotated"" multi-task dataset by combining task-specific datasets. However, the numbers of annotations for individual tasks are imbalanced, which
 may escalate an imbalance in training progress. To balance the training progress, we propose an achievement-based multi-task loss to modulate training speed based on the ""achievement,"" defined as the ratio of current accuracy to single-task accuracy. Then, we formulate the multitask loss as a weighted geometric mean of individual task losses instead of a weighted sum to prevent any task from dominating the loss. In experiments, we evaluated the accuracy and training speed of the proposed multi-task loss on the large-scale multi-task dataset against recent multitask losses. The proposed loss achieved the best multi-task accuracy without incurring training time overhead. Compared to single-task models, the proposed one achieved 1.28%, 1.65%, and 1.18% accuracy improvement in object detection, semantic segmentation, and depth estimation, respectively, while reducing computations to 33.73%.

ICCV-2023-2121,ICCV,2023,AerialVLN: Vision-and-Language Navigation for UAVs,"Shubo Liu, Hongsheng Zhang, Yuankai Qi, Peng Wang, Yanning Zhang, Qi Wu","Recently emerged Vision-and-Language Navigation(VLN) tasks have drawn significant attention in both computer vision and natural language processing communities. Existing VLN tasks are built for agents that navigate on the ground, either indoors or outdoors. However, many tasks require intelligent agents to carry out in the sky, such as UAV-based goods delivery, traffic/security patrol, and scenery tour, to name a few. Navigating in the sky is more complicated than on the ground because agents need to consider the flying height and more complex spatial relationship reasoning. To fill this gap and facilitate research in this field, we propose a new task named AerialVLN, which is UAV-based and towards outdoor environments. We develop a 3D simulator rendered by near-realistic pictures of 25 city-level scenarios. Our simulator supports continuous navigation, environment extension and configuration. We also proposed an extended baseline model based on the widely-used cross modal-alignment (CMA) navigation methods. We find that there is still a significant gap between the baseline model and human performance, which suggests AerialVLN is a new challenging task.",True,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/papers/Pratt_What_Does_a_Platypus_Look_Like_Generating_Customized_Prompts_for_ICCV_2023_paper.pdf
ICCV-2023-2127,ICCV,2023,Make-An-Animation: Large-Scale Text-conditional 3D Human Motion Generation,"Samaneh Azadi, Akbar Shah, Thomas Hayes, Devi Parikh, Sonal Gupta","Text-guided human motion generation has drawn significant interest because of its impactful applications spanning animation and robotics. Recently, application of diffusion models for motion generation has enabled improvements in the quality of generated motions. However, existing approaches are limited by their reliance on relatively small-scale motion capture data, leading to poor performance on more diverse, in-the-wild prompts. In this paper, we introduce Make-An-Animation, a text-conditioned human motion generation model which learns more diverse poses and prompts from large-scale image-text datasets, enabling significant improvement in performance over prior works. Make-An-Animation is trained in two stages. First, we train on a curated large-scale dataset of (text, static pseudo-pose) pairs extracted from image-text datasets. Second, we fine-tune on motion capture data, adding additional layers to model the temporal dimension. Unlike prior diffusion models for motion generation, Make-An-Animation uses a U-Net architecture similar to recent text-to-video generation models. Human evaluation of motion realism and alignment with input text shows that our model reaches state-of-the-art performance on text-to-motion generation.",True,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/papers/Zhang_When_Noisy_Labels_Meet_Long_Tail_Dilemmas_A_Representation_Calibration_ICCV_2023_paper.pdf
ICCV-2023-2132,ICCV,2023,RefEgo: Referring Expression Comprehension Dataset from First-Person Perception of Ego4D,"Shuhei Kurita, Naoki Katsura, Eri Onami","Grounding textual expressions on scene objects from first-person views is a truly demanding capability in developing agents that are aware of their surroundings and behave following intuitive text instructions. Such capability is of necessity for glass-devices or autonomous robots to localize referred objects in the real-world. In the conventional referring expression comprehension tasks of images, however, datasets are mostly constructed based on the web-crawled data and don't reflect diverse real-world structures on the task of grounding textual expressions in diverse objects in the real world. Recently, a massive-scale egocentric video dataset of Ego4D was proposed. Ego4D covers around the world diverse real-world scenes including numerous indoor and outdoor situations such as shopping, cooking, walking, talking, manufacturing, etc. Based on egocentric videos of Ego4D, we constructed a broad coverage of the video-based referring expression comprehension dataset: RefEgo. Our dataset includes more than 12k video clips and 41 hours for video-based referring expression comprehension annotation.
 In experiments, we combine the state-of-the-art 2D referring expression comprehension models with the object tracking algorithm, achieving the video-wise referred object tracking even in difficult conditions: the referred object becomes out-of-frame in the middle of the video or multiple similar objects are presented in the video.",True,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/papers/Wang_Why_do_networks_have_inhibitorynegative_connections_ICCV_2023_paper.pdf
ICCV-2023-2144,ICCV,2023,Supervised Homography Learning with Realistic Dataset Generation,"Hai Jiang, Haipeng Li, Songchen Han, Haoqiang Fan, Bing Zeng, Shuaicheng Liu","In this paper, we propose an iterative framework, which consists of two phases: a generation phase and a training phase, to generate realistic training data and yield a supervised homography network. In the generation phase, given an unlabeled image pair, we utilize the pre-estimated dominant plane masks and homography of the pair, along with another sampled homography that serves as ground truth to generate a new labeled training pair with realistic motion. In the training phase, the generated data is used to train the supervised homography network, in which the training data is refined via a content consistency module and a quality assessment module. Once an iteration is finished, the trained network is used in the next data generation phase to update the pre-estimated homography. Through such an iterative strategy, the quality of the dataset and the performance of the network can be gradually and simultaneously improved. Experimental results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance and existing supervised methods can be also improved based on the generated dataset.

ICCV-2023-2145,ICCV,2023,Learning in Imperfect Environment: Multi-Label Classification with Long-Tailed Distribution and Partial Labels,"Wenqiao Zhang, Changshuo Liu, Lingze Zeng, Bengchin Ooi, Siliang Tang, Yueting Zhuang","Conventional multi-label classification (MLC) methods assume that all samples are fully labeled and identically distributed. Unfortunately, this assumption is unrealistic in large-scale MLC data 
 that has long-tailed (LT) distribution and partial labels (PL).
 To address the problem, we introduce a novel task, Partial labeling and Long-Tailed Multi-Label Classification (PLT-MLC), to jointly consider the above two imperfect learning environments. Not surprisingly, we find that most LT-MLC and PL-MLC approaches fail to solve the PLT-MLC, resulting in significant performance degradation on the two proposed PLT-MLC benchmarks. Therefore, we propose an end-to-end learning framework: COrrection -> ModificatIon -> balanCe, abbreviated as COMC. 
 Our bootstrapping philosophy is to simultaneously correct the missing labels (Correction) with convinced prediction confidence over a class-aware threshold and to learn from these recall labels during training. 
 We next propose a novel multi-focal modifier loss that simultaneously addresses head-tail imbalance and positive-negative imbalance to adaptively modify the attention to different samples (Modification) under the LT class distribution.
 We also develop a balanced training strategy by distilling the model's learning effect from head and tail samples, and thus design the balanced classifier (Balance) conditioned on the head and tail learning effect to maintain a stable performance. 
 Our experimental study shows that the proposed method significantly outperforms the general MLC, LT-MLC and ML-MLC methods in terms of effectiveness and robustness on our newly created PLT-MLC datasets.",True,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/papers/Li_Your_Diffusion_Model_is_Secretly_a_Zero-Shot_Classifier_ICCV_2023_paper.pdf
