CVPR-2022-965,cvpr,2022,CrossLoc: Scalable Aerial Localization Assisted by Multimodal Synthetic Data,"Qi Yan, Jianhao Zheng, Simon Reding, Shanci Li, Iordan Doytchinov","We present a visual localization system that learns to estimate camera poses in the real world with the help of synthetic data. Despite significant progress in recent years, most learning-based approaches to visual localization target at a single domain and require a dense database of geo-tagged images to function well. To mitigate the data scarcity issue and improve the scalability of the neural localization models, we introduce TOPO-DataGen, a versatile synthetic data generation tool that traverses smoothly between the real and virtual world, hinged on the geographic camera viewpoint. New large-scale sim-to-real benchmark datasets are proposed to showcase and evaluate the utility of the said synthetic data. Our experiments reveal that synthetic data generically enhances the neural network performance on real data. Furthermore, we introduce CrossLoc, a cross-modal visual representation learning approach to pose estimation that makes full use of the scene coordinate ground truth via self-supervision. Without any extra data, CrossLoc significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods and achieves substantially higher real-data sample efficiency. Our code and datasets are all available at crossloc.github.io.",True,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2022/papers/Guo_LAR-SR_A_Local_Autoregressive_Model_for_Image_Super-Resolution_CVPR_2022_paper.pdf

Lambourne, Armando Solar-Lezama, Wojciech Matusik","Physical products are often complex assemblies combining a multitude of 3D parts modeled in computer-aided design (CAD) software. CAD designers build up these assemblies by aligning individual parts to one another using constraints called joints. In this paper we introduce JoinABLe, a learning-based method that assembles parts together to form joints. JoinABLe uses the weak supervision available in standard parametric CAD files without the help of object class labels or human guidance. Our results show that by making network predictions over a graph representation of solid models we can outperform multiple baseline methods with an accuracy (79.53%) that approaches human performance (80%). Finally, to support future research we release the AssemblyJoint dataset, containing assemblies with rich information on joints, contact surfaces, holes, and the underlying assembly graph structure.",True,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2022/papers/Shen_Semi-Weakly-Supervised_Learning_of_Complex_Actions_From_Instructional_Task_Videos_CVPR_2022_paper.pdf

State-of-the-art implementations of snapshot hyperspectral imaging rely on bulky, non-integrated, and expensive optical elements, including lenses, spectrometers, and filters. These macroscopic components do not allow fast data processing for, e.g., real-time and high-resolution videos. This work introduces Hyplex, a new integrated architecture addressing the limitations discussed above. Hyplex is a CMOS-compatible, fast hyperspectral camera that replaces bulk optics with nanoscale metasurfaces inversely designed through artificial intelligence. Hyplex does not require spectrometers but makes use of conventional monochrome cameras, opening up real-time and high-resolution hyperspectral imaging at inexpensive costs. Hyplex exploits a model-driven optimization, which connects the physical metasurfaces layer with modern visual computing approaches based on end-to-end training. We design and implement a prototype version of Hyplex and compare its performance against the state-of-the-art for typical imaging tasks such as spectral reconstruction and semantic segmentation. In all benchmarks, Hyplex reports the smallest reconstruction error. In addition, to the best of the authors' knowledge, we created FVgNET, the largest publicly available labeled hyperspectral dataset for semantic segmentation tasks.",True,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2022/papers/Tseng_Automatic_Synthesis_of_Diverse_Weak_Supervision_Sources_for_Behavior_Analysis_CVPR_2022_paper.pdf
CVPR-2022-1089,cvpr,2022,LD-ConGR: A Large RGB-D Video Dataset for Long-Distance Continuous Gesture Recognition,"Dan Liu, Libo Zhang, Yanjun Wu","Gesture recognition plays an important role in natural human-computer interaction and sign language recognition. Existing research on gesture recognition is limited to close-range interaction such as vehicle gesture control and face-to-face communication. To apply gesture recognition to long-distance interactive scenes such as meetings and smart homes, a large RGB-D video dataset LD-ConGR is established in this paper. LD-ConGR is distinguished from existing gesture datasets by its long-distance gesture collection, fine-grained annotations, and high video quality. Specifically, 1) the farthest gesture provided by the LD-ConGR is captured 4m away from the camera while existing gesture datasets collect gestures within 1m from the camera; 2) besides the gesture category, the temporal segmentation of gestures and hand location are also annotated in LD-ConGR; 3) videos are captured at high resolution (1280x720 for color streams and 640x576 for depth streams) and high frame rate (30 fps). On top of the LD-ConGR, a series of experimental and studies are conducted, and the proposed gesture region estimation and key frame sampling strategies are demonstrated to be effective in dealing with long-distance gesture recognition and the uncertainty of gesture duration. The dataset and experimental results presented in this paper are expected to boost the research of long-distance gesture recognition.

However, such models are inefficient in building multilingual sign language translation systems. To solve this problem, we introduce the multilingual sign language translation (MSLT) task. It aims to use a single model to complete the translation between multiple sign languages and spoken languages. Then, we propose MLSLT, the first MSLT model, which contains two novel dynamic routing mechanisms for controlling the degree of parameter sharing between different languages. Intra-layer language-specific routing controls the proportion of data flowing through shared parameters and language-specific parameters from the token level through a soft gate within the layer, and inter-layer language-specific routing controls and learns the data flow path of different languages at the language level through a soft gate between layers. In order to evaluate the performance of MLSLT, we collect the first publicly available multilingual sign language understanding dataset, Spreadthesign-Ten (SP-10), which contains up to 100 language pairs, e.g., CSL->en, GSG->zh. Experimental results show that the average performance of MLSLT outperforms the baseline MSLT model and the combination of multiple BSLT models in many cases. In addition, we also explore zero-shot translation in sign language and find that our model can achieve comparable performance to the supervised BSLT model on some language pairs.

CVPR-2022-1273,cvpr,2022,Stable Long-Term Recurrent Video Super-Resolution,"Benjamin Naoto Chiche, Arnaud Woiselle, Joana Frontera-Pons, Jean-Luc Starck","Recurrent models have gained popularity in deep learning (DL) based video super-resolution (VSR), due to their increased computational efficiency, temporal receptive field and temporal consistency compared to sliding-window based models. However, when inferring on long video sequences presenting low motion (i.e. in which some parts of the scene barely move), recurrent models diverge through recurrent processing, generating high frequency artifacts. To the best of our knowledge, no study about VSR pointed out this instability problem, which can be critical for some real-world applications. Video surveillance is a typical example where such artifacts would occur, as both the camera and the scene stay static for a long time. In this work, we expose instabilities of existing recurrent VSR networks on long sequences with low motion. We demonstrate it on a new long sequence dataset Quasi-Static Video Set, that we have created. Finally, we introduce a new framework of recurrent VSR networks that is both stable and competitive, based on Lipschitz stability theory. We propose a new recurrent VSR network, coined Middle Recurrent Video Super-Resolution (MRVSR), based on this framework. We empirically show its competitive performance on long sequences with low motion.",True,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2022/papers/Chen_Neural_Shape_Mating_Self-Supervised_Object_Assembly_With_Adversarial_Shape_Priors_CVPR_2022_paper.pdf
CVPR-2022-1843,cvpr,2022,The DEVIL Is in the Details: A Diagnostic Evaluation Benchmark for Video Inpainting,"Ryan Szeto, Jason J. Corso","Quantitative evaluation has increased dramatically among recent video inpainting work, but the video and mask content used to gauge performance has received relatively little attention. Although attributes such as camera and background scene motion inherently change the difficulty of the task and affect methods differently, existing evaluation schemes fail to control for them, thereby providing minimal insight into inpainting failure modes. To address this gap, we propose the Diagnostic Evaluation of Video Inpainting on Landscapes (DEVIL) benchmark, which consists of two contributions: (i) a novel dataset of videos and masks labeled according to several key inpainting failure modes, and (ii) an evaluation scheme that samples slices of the dataset characterized by a fixed content attribute, and scores performance on each slice according to reconstruction, realism, and temporal consistency quality. By revealing systematic changes in performance induced by particular characteristics of the input content, our challenging benchmark enables more insightful analysis into video inpainting methods and serves as an invaluable diagnostic tool for the field.

It has been widely agreed that vehicle-infrastructure cooperation is required to achieve Level 5 autonomy. However, there is still NO dataset from real scenarios available for computer vision researchers to work on vehicle-infrastructure cooperation-related problems. To accelerate computer vision research and innovation for Vehicle-Infrastructure Cooperative Autonomous Driving (VICAD), we release DAIR-V2X Dataset, which is the first large-scale, multi-modal, multi-view dataset from real scenarios for VICAD. DAIR-V2X comprises 71254 LiDAR frames and 71254 Camera frames, and all frames are captured from real scenes with 3D annotations. The Vehicle-Infrastructure Cooperative 3D Object Detection problem (VIC3D) is introduced, formulating the problem of collaboratively locating and identifying 3D objects using sensory input from both vehicles and infrastructure. In addition to solving traditional 3D object detection problems, the solution of VIC3D needs to consider the time asynchrony problem between vehicle and infrastructure sensors and the data transmission cost between them.

As a step in this direction, the ArtEmis dataset was recently introduced as a large-scale dataset of emotional reactions to images along with language explanations of these chosen emotions. We observed a significant emotional bias towards instance-rich emotions, making trained neural speakers less accurate in describing under-represented emotions. We show that collecting new data, in the same way, is not effective in mitigating this emotional bias. To remedy this problem, we propose a contrastive data collection approach to balance ArtEmis with a new complementary dataset such that a pair of similar images have contrasting emotions (one positive and one negative). We collected 260,533 instances using the proposed method, we combine them with ArtEmis, creating a second iteration of the dataset. The new combined dataset, dubbed ArtEmis v2.0, has a balanced distribution of emotions with explanations revealing more fine details in the associated painting. Our experiments show that neural speakers trained on the new dataset improve CIDEr and METEOR evaluation metrics by 20% and 7%, respectively, compared to the biased dataset. Finally, we also show that the performance per emotion of neural speakers is improved across all the emotion categories, significantly on under-represented emotions.

Human has the ability that transform the various exocentric interactions to invariant egocentric affordance so as to counter the impact of interactive diversity. To empower an agent with such ability, this paper proposes a task of affordance grounding from exocentric view, i.e., given exocentric human-object interaction and egocentric object images, learning the affordance knowledge of the object and transferring it to the egocentric image using only the affordance label as supervision. To this end, we devise a cross-view knowledge transfer framework that extracts affordance-specific features from exocentric interactions and enhances the perception of affordance regions by preserving affordance correlation. Specifically, an Affordance Invariance Mining module is devised to extract specific clues by minimizing the intra-class differences originated from interaction habits in exocentric images. Besides, an Affordance Co-relation Preserving strategy is presented to perceive and localize affordance by aligning the co-relation matrix of predicted results between the two views. Particularly, an affordance grounding dataset named AGD20K is constructed by collecting and labeling over 20K images from 36 affordance categories.

Eyes cannot be clearly seen in such cases due to occlusion and lacking resolution. Existing gaze estimation methods suffer or fall back to approximating gaze with head pose as they primarily rely on clear, close-up views of the eyes. Our key idea is to instead leverage the intrinsic gaze, head, and body coordination of people. Our method formulates gaze estimation as Bayesian prediction given temporal estimates of head and body orientations which can be reliably estimated from a far. We model the head and body orientation likelihoods and the conditional prior of gaze direction on those with separate neural networks which are then cascaded to output the 3D gaze direction. We introduce an extensive new dataset that consists of surveillance videos annotated with 3D gaze directions captured in 5 indoor and outdoor scenes. Experimental results on this and other datasets validate the accuracy of our method and demonstrate that gaze can be accurately estimated from a typical surveillance distance even when the person's face is not visible to the camera.",True,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2022/papers/Peng_Learning_Optimal_K-Space_Acquisition_and_Reconstruction_Using_Physics-Informed_Neural_Networks_CVPR_2022_paper.pdf

This task is helpful for many downstream tasks such as hand tracking and hand contact estimation. Associating hands with people is challenging in unconstrained conditions since multiple people can be present in the scene with varying overlaps and occlusions. We propose a novel end-to-end trainable convolutional network that can jointly detect hands and the body location for the corresponding person.

In this work, we introduce a novel type of sensing device, event cameras, for the task of ALR. Event cameras have both technical and application advantages over conventional cameras for the ALR task because they have higher temporal resolution, less redundant visual information, and lower power consumption. To recognize words from the event data, we propose a novel Multi-grained Spatio-Temporal Features Perceived Network (MSTP) to perceive fine-grained spatio-temporal features from microsecond time-resolved event data. Specifically, a multi-branch network architecture is designed, in which different grained spatio-temporal features are learned by operating at different frame rates. The branch operating on the low frame rate can perceive spatial complete but temporal coarse features. While the branch operating on the high frame rate can perceive spatial coarse but temporal refinement features. And a message flow module is devised to integrate the features from different branches, leading to perceiving more discriminative spatio-temporal features.

This ability of amodal perception forms the basis of our perceptual and cognitive understanding of our world. To enable robots to reason with this capability, we formulate and propose a novel task that we name amodal panoptic segmentation. The goal of this task is to simultaneously predict the pixel-wise semantic segmentation labels of the visible regions of stuff classes and the instance segmentation labels of both the visible and occluded regions of thing classes. To facilitate research on this new task, we extend two established benchmark datasets with pixel-level amodal panoptic segmentation labels that we make publicly available as KITTI-360-APS and BDD100K-APS.

An essential property of camouflaged objects is that they usually exhibit patterns similar to the background and thus make them hard to identify from still images. Therefore, effectively handling temporal dynamics in videos becomes the key for the VCOD task as the camouflaged objects will be noticeable when they move. However, current VCOD methods often leverage homography or optical flows to represent motions, where the detection error may accumulate from both the motion estimation error and the segmentation error. On the other hand, our method unifies motion estimation and object segmentation within a single optimization framework. Specifically, we build a dense correlation volume to implicitly capture motions between neighbouring frames and utilize the final segmentation supervision to optimize the implicit motion estimation and segmentation jointly. Furthermore, to enforce temporal consistency within a video sequence, we jointly utilize a spatio-temporal transformer to refine the short-term predictions. Extensive experiments on VCOD benchmarks demonstrate the architectural effectiveness of our approach.

Applications of MUFIN to product-to-product recommendation and bid query prediction over several millions of products are presented. Contemporary multi-modal methods frequently rely on purely embedding-based methods. On the other hand, XC methods utilize classifier architectures to offer superior accuracies than embedding-only methods but mostly focus on text-based categorization tasks. MUFIN bridges this gap by reformulating multi-modal categorization as an XC problem with several millions of labels. This presents the twin challenges of developing multi-modal architectures that can offer embeddings sufficiently expressive to allow accurate categorization over millions of labels; and training and inference routines that scale logarithmically in the number of labels.

These characteristics make them a perfect fit to several real-world applications such as egocentric action recognition on wearable devices, where fast camera motion and limited power challenge traditional vision sensors. However, the ever-growing field of event-based vision has, to date, overlooked the potential of event cameras in such applications. In this paper, we show that event data is a very valuable modality for egocentric action recognition. To do so, we introduce N-EPIC-Kitchens, the first event-based camera extension of the large-scale EPIC-Kitchens dataset. In this context, we propose two strategies: (i) directly processing event-camera data with traditional video-processing architectures (E^2(GO)) and (ii) using event-data to distill optical flow information E^2(GO)MO). On our proposed benchmark, we show that event data provides a comparable performance to RGB and optical flow, yet without any additional flow computation at deploy time, and an improved performance of up to 4% with respect to RGB only information.

This pipeline is partially motivated by recent progress in both object detection and re-ID, and partially motivated by biases in existing tracking datasets, where most objects tend to have distinguishing appearance and re-ID models are sufficient for establishing associations. In response to such bias, we would like to re-emphasize that methods for multi-object tracking should also work when object appearance is not sufficiently discriminative. To this end, we propose a large-scale dataset for multi-human tracking, where humans have similar appearance, diverse motion and extreme articulation. As the dataset contains mostly group dancing videos, we name it ""DanceTrack"". We expect DanceTrack to provide a better platform to develop more MOT algorithms that rely less on visual discrimination and depend more on motion analysis. We benchmark several state-of-the-art trackers on our dataset and observe a significant performance drop on DanceTrack when compared against existing benchmarks.

This configuration has a number of practical benefits, e.g., when processing large-scale datasets. Moreover, it is resistant to the typical degenerate cases of the traditional six-point algorithm. The minimal solver requires four point correspondences and exploits the gravity direction that the built-in IMU of recent smart devices recover. We also propose a linear solver that enables estimating the pose from a larger-than-minimal sample extremely efficiently which then can be improved by, e.g., bundle adjustment.

Meanwhile, the widespread availability of online social networks (OSNs) makes them the dominant channels for transmitting forged images to report fake news, propagate rumors, etc. Unfortunately, various lossy operations adopted by OSNs, e.g., compression and resizing, impose great challenges for implementing the robust image forgery detection. To fight against the OSN-shared forgeries, in this work, a novel robust training scheme is proposed. We first conduct a thorough analysis of the noise introduced by OSNs, and decouple it into two parts, i.e., predictable noise and unseen noise, which are modelled separately. The former simulates the noise introduced by the disclosed (known) operations of OSNs, while the latter is designed to not only complete the previous one, but also take into account the defects of the detector itself. We then incorporate the modelled noise into a robust training framework, significantly improving the robustness of the image forgery detector. Extensive experimental results are presented to validate the superiority of the proposed scheme compared with several state-of-the-art competitors. Finally, to promote the future development of the image forgery detection, we build a public forgeries dataset based on four existing datasets and three most popular OSNs.

However, the existing referring video semantic segmentation works mainly focus on the guidance of text-based referring expressions, due to the lack of modeling the semantic representation of audio-video interaction contents. In this paper, we consider the problem of audio-guided video semantic segmentation from the viewpoint of end-to-end denoised encoder-decoder network learning. We propose the walvelet-based encoder network to learn the crossmodal representations of the video contents with audio-form queries. Specifically, we adopt a multi-head cross-modal attention to explore the potential relations of video and query contents. A 2-dimension discrete wavelet transform is employed to decompose the audio-video features. We quantify the thresholds of high frequency coefficients to filter the noise and outliers. Then, a self attention-free decoder network is developed to generate the target masks with frequency domain transforms. Moreover, we maximize mutual information between the encoded features and multi-modal features after cross-modal attention to enhance the audio guidance.

Due to the low signal-to-noise ratio and low contrast, infrared targets are easily submerged in the background of heavy noise and clutter. How to detect the precise shape information of infrared targets remains challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel infrared shape network (ISNet), where Taylor finite difference (TFD)-inspired edge block and two-orientation attention aggregation (TOAA) block are devised to address this problem. Specifically, TFD-inspired edge block aggregates and enhances the comprehensive edge information from different levels, in order to improve the contrast between target and background and also lay a foundation for extracting shape information with mathematical interpretation. TOAA block calculates the low-level information with attention mechanism in both row and column directions and fuses it with the high-level information to capture the shape characteristic of targets and suppress noises. In addition, we construct a new benchmark consisting of 1,000 realistic images in various target shapes, different target sizes, and rich clutter backgrounds with accurate pixel-level annotations, called IRSTD-1k.

However, to create engaging video-content in movies and TV shows, the amount by which a camera can be moved while filming a particular shot is often limited. The resulting small-motion parallax between video frames makes standard geometry-based SfM approaches not as effective for movies and TV shows. To address this challenge, we propose a simple yet effective approach that uses single-frame depth-prior obtained from a pretrained network to significantly improve geometry-based SfM for our small-parallax setting. To this end, we first use the depth-estimates of the detected keypoints to reconstruct the point cloud and camera-pose for initial two-view reconstruction. We then perform depth-regularized optimization to register new images and triangulate the new points during incremental reconstruction. To comprehensively evaluate our approach, we introduce a new dataset (StudioSfM) consisting of 130 shots with 21K frames from 15 studio-produced videos that are manually annotated by a professional CG studio. We demonstrate that our approach: (a) significantly improves the quality of 3D reconstruction for our small-parallax setting, (b) does not cause any degradation for data with large-parallax, and (c) maintains the generalizability and scalability of geometry-based sparse SfM.

Existing methods optimize the hand-object contact driven by distance threshold or prior from contact-labeled datasets. However, due to the number of subjects and objects involved in these indoor datasets being limited, the learned contact patterns could not generalize easily. Our key idea is to reconstruct the contact pattern directly from monocular images and utilize the physical stability criterion in the simulation to drive the optimization process described above. This criterion is defined by the resultant forces and contact distribution computed by the physics engine. Compared to existing solutions, our framework can be adapted to more personalized hands and diverse object shapes.

In this scenario, anomaly detection is an open-set problem. However, some studies assimilate anomaly detection to action recognition. This is a closed-set scenario that fails to test the capability of systems at detecting new anomaly types. To this end, we propose UBnormal, a new supervised open-set benchmark composed of multiple virtual scenes for video anomaly detection. Unlike existing data sets, we introduce abnormal events annotated at the pixel level at training time, for the first time enabling the use of fully-supervised learning methods for abnormal event detection. To preserve the typical open-set formulation, we make sure to include disjoint sets of anomaly types in our training and test collections of videos.

Black","Given an image with multiple people, our goal is to directly regress the pose and shape of all the people as well as their relative depth. Inferring the depth of a person in an image, however, is fundamentally ambiguous without knowing their height. This is particularly problematic when the scene contains people of very different sizes, e.g. from infants to adults. To solve this, we need several things. First, we develop a novel method to infer the poses and depth of multiple people in a single image. While previous work that estimates multiple people does so by reasoning in the image plane, our method, called BEV, adds an additional imaginary Bird's-Eye-View representation to explicitly reason about depth. BEV reasons simultaneously about body centers in the image and in depth and, by combing these, estimates 3D body position. Unlike prior work, BEV is a single-shot method that is end-to-end differentiable. Second, height varies with age, making it impossible to resolve depth without also estimating the age of people in the image. To do so, we exploit a 3D body model space that lets BEV infer shapes from infants to adults. Third, to train BEV, we need a new dataset. Specifically, we create a ""Relative Human"" (RH) dataset that includes age labels and relative depth relationships between the people in the images. Extensive experiments on RH and AGORA demonstrate the effectiveness of the model and training scheme.

Therefore, this paper aims to explore dense 3D representations for gait recognition in the wild, which is a practical yet neglected problem. In particular, we propose a novel framework to explore the 3D Skinned Multi-Person Linear (SMPL) model of the human body for gait recognition, named SMPLGait.

However, they have some insuperable drawbacks, e.g., they cannot handle videos without references, and they may result in biased evaluation due to the one-to-many nature of video-to-text and the neglect of visual relevance. From the human evaluator's viewpoint, a high-quality caption should be consistent with the provided video, but not necessarily be similar to the reference in literal or semantics. Inspired by human evaluation, we propose EMScore (Embedding Matching-based score), a novel reference-free metric for video captioning, which directly measures similarity between video and candidate captions. Benefiting from the recent development of large-scale pre-training models, we exploit a well pre-trained vision-language model to extract visual and linguistic embeddings for computing EMScore. Specifically, EMScore combines matching scores of both coarse-grained (video and caption) and fine-grained (frames and words) levels, which takes the overall understanding and detailed characteristics of the video into account. Furthermore, considering the potential information gain, EMScore can be flexibly extended to the conditions where human-labeled references are available. Last but not least, we collect VATEX-EVAL and ActivityNet-FOIl datasets to systematically evaluate the existing metrics.

In this paper, we propose the idea of learning part segmentation through unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) from synthetic data. We first introduce UDA-Part, a comprehensive part segmentation dataset for vehicles that can serve as an adequate benchmark for UDA (https://qliu24.github.io/udapart/). In UDA-Part, we label parts on 3D CAD models which enables us to generate a large set of annotated synthetic images. We also annotate parts on a number of real images to provide a real test set. Secondly, to advance the adaptation of part models trained from the synthetic data to the real images, we introduce a new UDA algorithm that leverages the object's spatial structure to guide the adaptation process. Our experimental results on two real test datasets confirm the superiority of our approach over existing works, and demonstrate the promise of learning part segmentation for general objects from synthetic data. We believe our dataset provides a rich testbed to study UDA for part segmentation and will help to significantly push forward research in this area.",True,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2022/papers/Liu_GraftNet_Towards_Domain_Generalized_Stereo_Matching_With_a_Broad-Spectrum_and_CVPR_2022_paper.pdf

This work instead develops a novel unsupervised domain adaptation framework for nighttime aerial tracking (named UDAT). Specifically, a unique object discovery approach is provided to generate training patches from raw nighttime tracking videos. To tackle the domain discrepancy, we employ a Transformer-based bridging layer post to the feature extractor to align image features from both domains. With a Transformer day/night feature discriminator, the daytime tracking model is adversarially trained to track at night. Moreover, we construct a pioneering benchmark namely NAT2021 for unsupervised domain adaptive nighttime tracking, which comprises a test set of 180 manually annotated tracking sequences and a train set of over 276k unlabelled nighttime tracking frames.

Sohn, Seonghyeon Moon, Sejong Yoon, Mubbasir Kapadia, Vladimir Pavlovic","Accurate long-term trajectory prediction in complex scenes, where multiple agents (e.g., pedestrians or vehicles) interact with each other and the environment while attempting to accomplish diverse and often unknown goals, is a challenging stochastic forecasting problem. In this work, we propose MUSE-VAE, a new probabilistic modeling framework based on a cascade of Conditional VAEs, which tackles the long-term, uncertain trajectory prediction task using a coarse-to-fine multi-factor forecasting architecture. In its Macro stage, the model learns a joint pixel-space representation of two key factors, the underlying environment and the agent movements, to predict the long and short term motion goals. Conditioned on them, the Micro stage learns a fine-grained spatio-temporal representation for the prediction of individual agent trajectories. The VAE backbones across the two stages make it possible to naturally account for the joint uncertainty at both levels of granularity. As a result, MUSE-VAE offers diverse and simultaneously more accurate predictions compared to the current state-of-the-art.

However, the majority of existing models require pre-training on a large set of parallel image-text data, which is costly to collect, compared to image-only or text-only data. In this paper, we propose unsupervised Vision-and-Language pre-training (UVLP) to learn the cross-modal representation from non-parallel image and text datasets. We found two key factors that lead to good unsupervised V+L pre-training without parallel data: (i) joint image-and-text input (ii) overall image-text alignment (even for non-parallel data). Accordingly, we propose a novel unsupervised V+L pre-training curriculum for non-parallel texts and images. We first construct a weakly aligned image-text corpus via a retrieval-based approach, then apply a set of multi-granular alignment pre-training tasks, including region-to-tag, region-to-phrase, and image-to-sentence alignment, to bridge the gap between the two modalities. A comprehensive ablation study shows each granularity is helpful to learn a stronger pre-trained model.

We introduce a framework for learning to estimate 4D visual representations from monocular RGB-D video, which is able to persist objects, even once they become obstructed by occlusions. Unlike traditional video representations, we encode point clouds into a continuous representation, which permits the model to attend across the spatiotemporal context to resolve occlusions. On two large video datasets that we release along with this paper, our experiments show that the representation is able to successfully reveal occlusions for several tasks, without any architectural changes. Visualizations show that the attention mechanism automatically learns to follow occluded objects.

First, we develop a virtual teleoperation data-collection infrastructure - connecting Habitat simulator running in a web browser to Amazon Mechanical Turk, allowing remote users to teleoperate virtual robots, safely and at scale. We collect 80k demonstrations for ObjectNav and 12k demonstrations for Pick&Place, which is an order of magnitude larger than existing human demonstration datasets in simulation or on real robots. Our virtual teleoperation data contains 29.3M actions, and is equivalent to 22.6k hours of real-world teleoperation time, and illustrates rich, diverse strategies for solving the tasks. Second, we use this data to answer the question - how does large-scale imitation learning (IL) (which has not been hitherto possible) compare to reinforcement learning (RL) (which is the status quo)? On ObjectNav, we find that IL (with no bells or whistles) using 70k human demonstrations outperforms RL using 240k agent-gathered trajectories. This effectively establishes an 'exchange rate' - a single human demonstration appears to be worth  4 agent-gathered ones. More importantly, we find the IL-trained agent learns efficient object-search behavior from humans - it peeks into rooms, checks corners for small objects, turns in place to get a panoramic view - none of these are exhibited as prominently by the RL agent, and to induce these behaviors via contemporary RL techniques would require tedious reward engineering. Finally, accuracy vs. training data size plots show promising scaling behavior, suggesting that simply collecting more demonstrations is likely to advance the state of art further. On Pick&Place, the comparison is starker - IL agents achieve  18% success on episodes with new object-receptacle locations when trained with 9.5k human demonstrations, while RL agents fail to get beyond 0%. Overall, our work provides compelling evidence for investing in large-scale imitation learning.

Due to the complicated structure and multifarious appearance of human bodies, existing methods either fall back on the 3D domain via body morphable model or resort to keypoint-based image deformation, leading to inefficiency and unsatisfied visual quality. In this paper, we address these limitations by formulating an end-to-end flow generation architecture under the guidance of body structural priors, including skeletons and Part Affinity Fields, and achieve unprecedentedly controllable performance under arbitrary poses and garments. A compositional attention mechanism is introduced for capturing both visual perceptual correlations and structural associations of the human body to reinforce the manipulation consistency among related parts.

USG is the most common diagnostic modality for GB diseases due to its low cost and accessibility. However, USG images are challenging to analyze due to low image quality, noise, and varying viewpoints due to the handheld nature of the sensor. Our exhaustive study of state-of-the-art (SOTA) image classification techniques for the problem reveals that they often fail to learn the salient GB region due to the presence of shadows in the USG images. SOTA object detection techniques also achieve low accuracy because of spurious textures due to noise or adjacent organs. We propose GBCNet to tackle the challenges in our problem. GBCNet first extracts the regions of interest (ROIs) by detecting the GB (and not the cancer), and then uses a new multi-scale, second-order pooling architecture specializing in classifying GBC. To effectively handle spurious textures, we propose a curriculum inspired by human visual acuity, which reduces the texture biases in GBCNet. Experimental results demonstrate that GBCNet significantly outperforms SOTA CNN models, as well as the expert radiologists. Our technical innovations are generic to other USG image analysis tasks as well. Hence, as a validation, we also show the efficacy of GBCNet in detecting breast cancer from USG images.

While deep learning approach shows great promise in solving image restoration problems, defocus deblurring demands accurate training data that consists of all-in-focus and defocus image pairs, which is difficult to collect. Naive two-shot capturing cannot achieve pixel-wise correspondence between the defocused and all-in-focus image pairs. Synthetic aperture of light fields is suggested to be a more reliable way to generate accurate image pairs. However, the defocus blur generated from light field data is different from that of the images captured with a traditional digital camera. In this paper, we propose a novel deep defocus deblurring network that leverages the strength and overcomes the shortcoming of light fields.

Then, we fine-tune the network using feature loss on another dataset collected by the two-shot method to alleviate the differences between the defocus blur exists in the two domains.

While existing unsupervised methods are able to learn image denoising without ground-truth clean images, they either show poor performance or work under impractical settings (e.g., paired noisy images). In this paper, we present a practical unsupervised image denoising method to achieve state-of-the-art denoising performance. Our method only requires single noisy images and a noise model, which is easily accessible in practical raw image denoising. It performs two steps iteratively: (1) Constructing a noisier-noisy dataset with random noise from the noise model; (2) training a model on the noisier-noisy dataset and using the trained model to refine noisy images to obtain the targets used in the next round. We further approximate our full iterative method with a fast algorithm for more efficient training while keeping its original high performance. Experiments on real-world, synthetic, and correlated noise show that our proposed unsupervised denoising approach has superior performances over existing unsupervised methods and competitive performance with supervised methods. In addition, we argue that existing denoising datasets are of low quality and contain only a small number of scenes. To evaluate raw image denoising performance in real-world applications, we build a high-quality raw image dataset SenseNoise-500 that contains 500 real-life scenes.

This has many applications in medicine and biomechanics. Existing state-of-the-art biomechanical skeletons are detailed but do not easily generalize to new subjects. Additionally, computer vision and graphics methods that predict skeletons are typically heuristic, not learned from data, do not leverage the full 3D body surface, and are not validated against ground truth. To our knowledge, our system, called OSSO (Obtaining Skeletal Shape from Outside), is the first to learn the mapping from the 3D body surface to the internal skeleton from real data. We do so using 1000 male and 1000 female dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans. To these, we fit a parametric 3D body shape model (STAR) to capture the body surface and a novel part-based 3D skeleton model to capture the bones. This provides inside/outside training pairs. We model the statistical variation of full skeletons using PCA in a pose-normalized space and train a regressor from body shape parameters to skeleton shape parameters.

Black","While methods that regress 3D human meshes from images have progressed rapidly, the estimated body shapes often do not capture the true human shape. This is problematic since, for many applications, accurate body shape is as important as pose. The key reason that body shape accuracy lags pose accuracy is the lack of data. While humans can label 2D joints, and these constrain 3D pose, it is not so easy to ""label"" 3D body shape. Since paired data with images and 3D body shape are rare, we exploit two sources of information: (1) we collect internet images of diverse ""fashion"" models together with a small set of anthropometric measurements; (2) we collect linguistic shape attributes for a wide range of 3D body meshes and the model images. Taken together, these datasets provide sufficient constraints to infer dense 3D shape. We exploit the anthropometric measurements and linguistic shape attributes in several novel ways to train a neural network, called SHAPY, that regresses 3D human pose and shape from an RGB image. We evaluate SHAPY on public benchmarks, but note that they either lack significant body shape variation, ground-truth shape, or clothing variation. Thus, we collect a new dataset for evaluating 3D human shape estimation, called HBW, containing photos of ""Human Bodies in the Wild"" for which we have ground-truth 3D body scans.

In this paper, we seek to temporally localize object states (e.g. ""empty"" and ""full"" cup) together with the corresponding state-modifying actions (""pouring coffee"") in long uncurated videos with minimal supervision. The contributions of this work are threefold. First, we develop a self-supervised model for jointly learning state-modifying actions together with the corresponding object states from an uncurated set of videos from the Internet. The model is self-supervised by the causal ordering signal, i.e. initial object state -> manipulating action -> end state. Second, to cope with noisy uncurated training data, our model incorporates a noise adaptive weighting module supervised by a small number of annotated still images, that allows to efficiently filter out irrelevant videos during training. Third, we collect a new dataset with more than 2600 hours of video and 34 thousand changes of object states, and manually annotate a part of this data to validate our approach.

To enable maneuverable control in line with user intentions, a novel video generation task, named Text-Image-to-Video generation (TI2V), is proposed. With both controllable appearance and motion, TI2V aims at generating videos from a static image and a text description. The key challenges of TI2V task lie both in aligning appearance and motion from different modalities, and in handling uncertainty in text descriptions. To address these challenges, we propose a Motion Anchor-based video GEnerator (MAGE) with an innovative motion anchor (MA) structure to store appearance-motion aligned representation. To model the uncertainty and increase the diversity, it further allows the injection of explicit condition and implicit randomness. Through three-dimensional axial transformers, MA is interacted with given image to generate next frames recursively with satisfying controllability and diversity. Accompanying the new task, we build two new video-text paired datasets based on MNIST and CATER for evaluation.

Chan, Shangchen Zhou, Xiangyu Xu, Chen Change Loy","The diversity and complexity of degradations in real-world video super-resolution (VSR) pose non-trivial challenges in inference and training. First, while long-term propagation leads to improved performance in cases of mild degradations, severe in-the-wild degradations could be exaggerated through propagation, impairing output quality. To balance the tradeoff between detail synthesis and artifact suppression, we found an image pre-cleaning stage indispensable to reduce noises and artifacts prior to propagation. Equipped with a carefully designed cleaning module, our RealBasicVSR outperforms existing methods in both quality and efficiency. Second, real-world VSR models are often trained with diverse degradations to improve generalizability, requiring increased batch size to produce a stable gradient. Inevitably, the increased computational burden results in various problems, including 1) speed-performance tradeoff and 2) batch-length tradeoff. To alleviate the first tradeoff, we propose a stochastic degradation scheme that reduces up to 40% of training time without sacrificing performance. We then analyze different training settings and suggest that employing longer sequences rather than larger batches during training allows more effective uses of temporal information, leading to more stable performance during inference.

Previous works have shown compelling comprehensive results by building hierarchical structures for visual scenes (e.g., scene graphs) and natural languages (e.g., dependency trees), individually. However, how to construct a joint vision-language (VL) structure has barely been investigated. More challenging but worthwhile, we introduce a new task that targets on inducing such a joint VL structure in an unsupervised manner. Our goal is to bridge the visual scene graphs and linguistic dependency trees seamlessly. Due to the lack of VL structural data, we start by building a new dataset VLParse. Rather than using labor-intensive labeling from scratch, we propose an automatic alignment procedure to produce coarse structures followed by human refinement to produce high-quality ones. Moreover, we benchmark our dataset by proposing a contrastive learning (CL)-based framework VLGAE, short for Vision-Language Graph Autoencoder. Our model obtains superior performance on two derived tasks, i.e., language grammar induction and VL phrase grounding.

WebQA mirrors the way humans use the web: 1) Ask a question, 2) Choose sources to aggregate, and 3) Produce a fluent language response. This is the behavior we should be expecting from IoT devices and digital assistants. Existing work prefers to assume that a model can either reason about knowledge in images or in text. WebQA includes a secondary text-only QA task to ensure improved visual performance does not come at the cost of language understanding.

However, such a dataset is prohibitively expensive in 3D computer vision due to the substantial collection cost. To alleviate this issue, we propose a cost-effective method for automatically generating a large amount of 3D objects with annotations. In particular, we synthesize objects simply by assembling multiple random primitives. These objects are thus auto-annotated with part-based labels originating from primitives. This allows us to perform multi-task learning by combining the supervised segmentation with unsupervised reconstruction. Considering the large overhead of learning on the generated dataset, we further propose a dataset distillation strategy to remove redundant samples regarding a target dataset. We conduct extensive experiments for the downstream tasks of 3D object classification. The results indicate that our dataset, together with multi-task pretraining on its annotations, achieves the best performance compared to other commonly used datasets. Further study suggests that our strategy can improve the model performance by pretraining and fine-tuning scheme, especially for a dataset with a small scale. In addition, pretraining with the proposed dataset distillation method can save 86% of the pretraining time with negligible performance degradation.

Typical setups assume that we can collect data from all environments at all times. In practice, however, different prediction tasks may arrive sequentially so that the environments may change persistently throughout the training procedure.

In this paper, we study a new continual learning problem in the context of video prediction, and observe that most existing methods suffer from severe catastrophic forgetting in this setup. To tackle this problem, we propose the continual predictive learning (CPL) approach, which learns a mixture world model via predictive experience replay and performs test-time adaptation with non-parametric task inference.

However, in safety-critical settings, robustness to out-of-domain and long-tail samples is fundamental to circumvent dangerous issues, such as the misdetection of damaged or rare cars. In this work, we substantially improve the generalization of 3D object detectors to out-of-domain data by deforming point clouds during training. We achieve this with 3D-VField: a novel data augmentation method that plausibly deforms objects via vector fields learned in an adversarial fashion. Our approach constrains 3D points to slide along their sensor view rays while neither adding nor removing any of them. The obtained vectors are transferable, sample-independent and preserve shape and occlusions. Despite training only on a standard dataset, such as KITTI, augmenting with our vector fields significantly improves the generalization to differently shaped objects and scenes.

We introduce a new dataset, Watch and Learn Time-lapse (WALT), consisting of 12 (4K and 1080p) cameras capturing urban environments over a year.

We show how to speed up the discovery of unoccluded objects and relate the confidence in this discovery to the rate and accuracy of training occluded objects.

Previous methods either rely on manual visual checking or RGB image-based inspection algorithm, requiring costly preparation procedures (e.g., open the bag and spread the waste items). Moreover, occluded items are very likely to be left out. Inspired by the fact that X-ray has a strong penetrating power to see through the bag and overlapping objects, we propose to perform waste inspection efficiently using X-ray images without the need to open the bag. We introduce a novel problem of instance-level waste segmentation in X-ray image for intelligent waste inspection, and contribute a real dataset consisting of 5,038 X-ray images (totally 30,881 waste items) with high-quality annotations (i.e., waste categories, object boxes, and instance-level masks) as a benchmark for this problem. As existing segmentation methods are mainly designed for natural images and cannot take advantage of the characteristics of X-ray waste images (e.g., heavy occlusions and penetration effect), we propose a new instance segmentation method to explicitly take these image characteristics into account. Specifically, our method adopts an easy-to-hard disassembling strategy to use high confidence predictions to guide the segmentation of highly overlapped objects, and a global structure guidance module to better capture the complex contour information caused by the penetration effect.

Therefore, we limit ourselves to only surface detections (i.e. binary mask) of liquids as observations and do not assume any prior knowledge on the liquids properties. A novel optimization problem is posed which reconstructs the liquid as particles by minimizing the error between a rendered surface from the particles and the surface detections while satisfying liquid constraints.

Using the HDR-NeRF, we are able to generate both novel HDR views and novel LDR views under different exposures. The key to our method is to model the physical imaging process, which dictates that the radiance of a scene point transforms to a pixel value in the LDR image with two implicit functions: a radiance field and a tone mapper. The radiance field encodes the scene radiance (values vary from 0 to +infty), which outputs the density and radiance of a ray by giving corresponding ray origin and ray direction. The tone mapper models the mapping process that a ray hitting on the camera sensor becomes a pixel value. The color of the ray is predicted by feeding the radiance and the corresponding exposure time into the tone mapper. We use the classic volume rendering technique to project the output radiance, colors, and densities into HDR and LDR images, while only the input LDR images are used as the supervision.

Training nightmode ISP networks relies on large-scale datasets of image pairs with: (1) a noisy raw image captured with a short exposure and a high ISO gain; and (2) a ground truth low-noise raw image captured with a long exposure and low ISO that has been rendered through the ISP. Capturing such image pairs is tedious and time-consuming, requiring careful setup to ensure alignment between the image pairs. In addition, ground truth images are often prone to motion blur due to the long exposure. To address this problem, we propose a method that synthesizes nighttime images from daytime images. Daytime images are easy to capture, exhibit low-noise (even on smartphone cameras) and rarely suffer from motion blur. We outline a processing framework to convert daytime raw images to have the appearance of realistic nighttime raw images with different levels of noise.

Couzin, Fumihiro Kano, Máté Nagy","Recent advances in machine learning and computer vision are revolutionizing the field of animal behavior by enabling researchers to track the poses and locations of freely moving animals without any marker attachment. However, large datasets of annotated images of animals for markerless pose tracking, especially high-resolution images taken from multiple angles with accurate 3D annotations, are still scant. Here, we propose a method that uses a motion capture (mo-cap) system to obtain a large amount of annotated data on animal movement and posture (2D and 3D) in a semi-automatic manner. Our method is novel in that it extracts the 3D positions of morphological keypoints (e.g eyes, beak, tail) in reference to the positions of markers attached to the animals. Using this method, we obtained, and offer here, a new dataset - 3D-POP with approximately 300k annotated frames (4 million instances) in the form of videos having groups of one to ten freely moving birds from 4 different camera views in a 3.6m x 4.2m area. 3D-POP is the first dataset of flocking birds with accurate keypoint annotations in 2D and 3D along with bounding box and individual identities and will facilitate the development of solutions for problems of 2D to 3D markerless pose, trajectory tracking, and identification in birds.",True,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/papers/Aoshima_Deep_Curvilinear_Editing_Commutative_and_Nonlinear_Image_Manipulation_for_Pretrained_CVPR_2023_paper.pdf

However, it has also been shown that VL models are still brittle in Structured VL Concept (SVLC) reasoning, such as the ability to recognize object attributes, states, and inter-object relations. This leads to reasoning mistakes, which need to be corrected as they occur by teaching VL models the missing SVLC skills; often this must be done using private data where the issue was found, which naturally leads to a data-free continual (no task-id) VL learning setting. In this work, we introduce the first Continual Data-Free Structured VL Concepts Learning (ConStruct-VL) benchmark and show it is challenging for many existing data-free CL strategies. We, therefore, propose a data-free method comprised of a new approach of Adversarial Pseudo-Replay (APR) which generates adversarial reminders of past tasks from past task models. To use this method efficiently, we also propose a continual parameter-efficient Layered-LoRA (LaLo) neural architecture allowing no-memory-cost access to all past models at train time.

As the central part of neurons, somas in the full brain indicate the origin of neurogenesis and neural functions. However, due to the absence of EM datasets specifically annotated for somas, existing deep learning-based neuron reconstruction methods cannot directly provide accurate soma distribution and morphology. Moreover, full brain neuron reconstruction remains extremely time-consuming due to the unprecedentedly large size of EM data. In this paper, we develop an efficient soma reconstruction method for obtaining accurate soma distribution and morphology information in a full adult fly brain. To this end, we first make a high-resolution EM dataset with fine-grained 3D manual annotations on somas. Relying on this dataset, we propose an efficient, two-stage deep learning algorithm for predicting accurate locations and boundaries of 3D soma instances. Further, we deploy a parallelized, high-throughput data processing pipeline for executing the above algorithm on the full brain. Finally, we provide quantitative and qualitative benchmark comparisons on the testset to validate the superiority of the proposed method, as well as preliminary statistics of the reconstructed somas in the full adult fly brain from the biological perspective.

In 3D, existing benchmarks are small in size and approaches specialize in few object categories and specific domains, e.g. urban driving scenes. Motivated by the success of 2D recognition, we revisit the task of 3D object detection by introducing a large benchmark, called Omni3D. Omni3D re-purposes and combines existing datasets resulting in 234k images annotated with more than 3 million instances and 98 categories. 3D detection at such scale is challenging due to variations in camera intrinsics and the rich diversity of scene and object types.

In this paper, we introduce the Unicode Analogies challenge, consisting of polysemic, character-based PMPs to benchmark fluid conceptualisation ability in vision systems. Writing systems have evolved characters at multiple levels of abstraction, from iconic through to symbolic representations, producing both visually interrelated yet exceptionally diverse images when compared to those exhibited by existing PMP datasets.

Black, Silvia Zuffi","We address the problem of inferring the 3D shape and pose of dogs from images. Given the lack of 3D training data, this problem is challenging, and the best methods lag behind those designed to estimate human shape and pose. To make progress, we attack the problem from multiple sides at once. First, we need a good 3D shape prior, like those available for humans. To that end, we learn a dog-specific 3D parametric model, called D-SMAL. Second, existing methods focus on dogs in standing poses because when they sit or lie down, their legs are self occluded and their bodies deform. Without access to a good pose prior or 3D data, we need an alternative approach. To that end, we exploit contact with the ground as a form of side information. We consider an existing large dataset of dog images and label any 3D contact of the dog with the ground. We exploit body-ground contact in estimating dog pose and find that it significantly improves results. Third, we develop a novel neural network architecture to infer and exploit this contact information. Fourth, to make progress, we have to be able to measure it. Current evaluation metrics are based on 2D features like keypoints and silhouettes, which do not directly correlate with 3D errors. To address this, we create a synthetic dataset containing rendered images of scanned 3D dogs. With these advances, our method recovers significantly better dog shape and pose than the state of the art, and we evaluate this improvement in 3D.

A key challenge of this problem setting is that existing music video datasets provide the needed (video, music) training pairs, but lack text descriptions of the music. This work addresses this challenge with the following three contributions. First, we propose a text-synthesis approach that relies on an analogy-based prompting procedure to generate natural language music descriptions from a large-scale language model (BLOOM-176B) given pre-trained music tagger outputs and a small number of human text descriptions. Second, we use these synthesized music descriptions to train a new trimodal model, which fuses text and video input representations to query music samples. For training, we introduce a text dropout regularization mechanism which we show is critical to model performance. Our model design allows for the retrieved music audio to agree with the two input modalities by matching visual style depicted in the video and musical genre, mood, or instrumentation described in the natural language query. Third, to evaluate our approach, we collect a testing dataset for our problem by annotating a subset of 4k clips from the YT8M-MusicVideo dataset with natural language music descriptions which we make publicly available.

To arrive at this conclusion, we introduce a new compositionality evaluation benchmark, CREPE, which measures two important aspects of compositionality identified by cognitive science literature: systematicity and productivity. To measure systematicity, CREPE consists of a test dataset containing over 370K image-text pairs and three different seen-unseen splits. The three splits are designed to test models trained on three popular training datasets: CC-12M, YFCC-15M, and LAION-400M.

To test productivity, CREPE contains 17K image-text pairs with nine different complexities plus 278K hard negative captions with atomic, swapping, and negation foils. The datasets are generated by repurposing the Visual Genome scene graphs and region descriptions and applying handcrafted templates and GPT-3. For systematicity, we find that model performance decreases consistently when novel compositions dominate the retrieval set, with Recall@1 dropping by up to 9%. For productivity, models' retrieval success decays as complexity increases, frequently nearing random chance at high complexity.

To address the first problem, we propose a geometry-aware temporal aggregation module to handle the egomotion explicitly. The effect of egomotion is mitigated by estimating the temporal geometry transformation and exploiting it to update visual representations.

Yet, this important phenomenon is largely absent from existing video object segmentation (VOS) benchmarks. In this work, we close the gap by collecting a new dataset for Video Object Segmentation under Transformations (VOST). It consists of more than 700 high-resolution videos, captured in diverse environments, which are 20 seconds long on average and densely labeled with instance masks. A careful, multi-step approach is adopted to ensure that these videos focus on complex object transformations, capturing their full temporal extent. We then extensively evaluate state-of-the-art VOS methods and make a number of important discoveries. In particular, we show that existing methods struggle when applied to this novel task and that their main limitation lies in over-reliance on static, appearance cues. This motivates us to propose a few modifications for the top-performing baseline that improve its performance by better capturing spatio-temporal information. But more broadly, the hope is to stimulate discussion on learning more robust video object representations.",True,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/papers/Chi_BEV-SAN_Accurate_BEV_3D_Object_Detection_via_Slice_Attention_Networks_CVPR_2023_paper.pdf
CVPR-2023-1081,cvpr,2023,Human Guided Ground-Truth Generation for Realistic Image Super-Resolution,"Du Chen, Jie Liang, Xindong Zhang, Ming Liu, Hui Zeng, Lei Zhang","How to generate the ground-truth (GT) image is a critical issue for training realistic image super-resolution (Real-ISR) models. Existing methods mostly take a set of high-resolution (HR) images as GTs and apply various degradations to simulate their low-resolution (LR) counterparts. Though great progress has been achieved, such an LR-HR pair generation scheme has several limitations. First, the perceptual quality of HR images may not be high enough, limiting the quality of Real-ISR outputs. Second, existing schemes do not consider much human perception in GT generation, and the trained models tend to produce over-smoothed results or unpleasant artifacts. With the above considerations, we propose a human guided GT generation scheme. We first elaborately train multiple image enhancement models to improve the perceptual quality of HR images, and enable one LR image having multiple HR counterparts. Human subjects are then involved to annotate the high quality regions among the enhanced HR images as GTs, and label the regions with unpleasant artifacts as negative samples. A human guided GT image dataset with both positive and negative samples is then constructed, and a loss function is proposed to train the Real-ISR models. Experiments show that the Real-ISR models trained on our dataset can produce perceptually more realistic results with less artifacts.

The current diagnosis of MVI relies on pathologists to manually find out cancerous cells from hundreds of blood vessels, which is time-consuming, tedious, and subjective. Recently, deep learning has achieved promising results in medical image analysis tasks. However, the unexplainability of black box models and the requirement of massive annotated samples limit the clinical application of deep learning based diagnostic methods. In this paper, aiming to develop an accurate, objective, and explainable diagnosis tool for MVI, we propose a Loopback Network (LoopNet) for classifying MVI efficiently. With the image-level category annotations of the collected Pathologic Vessel Image Dataset (PVID), LoopNet is devised to be composed binary classification branch and cell locating branch. The latter is devised to locate the area of cancerous cells, regular non-cancerous cells, and background. For healthy samples, the pseudo masks of cells supervise the cell locating branch to distinguish the area of regular non-cancerous cells and background. For each MVI sample, the cell locating branch predicts the mask of cancerous cells. Then the masked cancerous and non-cancerous areas of the same sample are inputted back to the binary classification branch separately. The loopback between two branches enables the category label to supervise the cell locating branch to learn the locating ability for cancerous areas. Experiment results show that the proposed LoopNet achieves 97.5% accuracy on MVI classification. Surprisingly, the proposed loopback mechanism not only enables LoopNet to predict the cancerous area but also facilitates the classification backbone to achieve better classification performance.",True,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/papers/Wang_Generalist_Decoupling_Natural_and_Robust_Generalization_CVPR_2023_paper.pdf

However, these models lack the ability to mimic the appearance of subjects in a given reference set and synthesize novel renditions of them in different contexts. In this work, we present a new approach for ""personalization"" of text-to-image diffusion models. Given as input just a few images of a subject, we fine-tune a pretrained text-to-image model such that it learns to bind a unique identifier with that specific subject. Once the subject is embedded in the output domain of the model, the unique identifier can be used to synthesize novel photorealistic images of the subject contextualized in different scenes. By leveraging the semantic prior embedded in the model with a new autogenous class-specific prior preservation loss, our technique enables synthesizing the subject in diverse scenes, poses, views and lighting conditions that do not appear in the reference images. We apply our technique to several previously-unassailable tasks, including subject recontextualization, text-guided view synthesis, and artistic rendering, all while preserving the subject's key features.

However, current methods often assume that the observed sequences are complete while ignoring the potential for missing values caused by object occlusion, scope limitation, sensor failure, etc. This limitation inevitably hinders the accuracy of trajectory prediction. To address this issue, our paper presents a unified framework, the Graph-based Conditional Variational Recurrent Neural Network (GC-VRNN), which can perform trajectory imputation and prediction simultaneously. Specifically, we introduce a novel Multi-Space Graph Neural Network (MS-GNN) that can extract spatial features from incomplete observations and leverage missing patterns. Additionally, we employ a Conditional VRNN with a specifically designed Temporal Decay (TD) module to capture temporal dependencies and temporal missing patterns in incomplete trajectories. The inclusion of the TD module allows for valuable information to be conveyed through the temporal flow.

Automatic recognition of animals and their behaviors is critical for capitalizing on the large unlabeled datasets generated by modern video devices and for accelerating monitoring efforts at scale.

Existing video datasets 1) do not classify animals according to established biological taxonomies; 2) are too small to facilitate large-scale behavioral studies and are often limited to a single species; and 3) do not feature temporally localized annotations and therefore do not facilitate localization of targeted behaviors within longer video sequences.

Existing open-vocabulary tasks focus on object classes, whereas research on object attributes is limited due to the lack of a reliable attribute-focused evaluation benchmark. This paper introduces the Open-Vocabulary Attribute Detection (OVAD) task and the corresponding OVAD benchmark. The objective of the novel task and benchmark is to probe object-level attribute information learned by vision-language models. To this end, we created a clean and densely annotated test set covering 117 attribute classes on the 80 object classes of MS COCO. It includes positive and negative annotations, which enables open-vocabulary evaluation. Overall, the benchmark consists of 1.4 million annotations.

In practical applications, e.g., poster designs, the canvas is originally non-empty, and both inter-element relationships as well as inter-layer relationships should be concerned when generating a proper layout. A few recent works deal with them simultaneously, but they still suffer from poor graphic performance, such as a lack of layout variety or spatial non-alignment. Since content-aware visual-textual presentation layout is a novel task, we first construct a new dataset named PKU PosterLayout, which consists of 9,974 poster-layout pairs and 905 images, i.e., non-empty canvases. It is more challenging and useful for greater layout variety, domain diversity, and content diversity. Then, we propose design sequence formation (DSF) that reorganizes elements in layouts to imitate the design processes of human designers, and a novel CNN-LSTM-based conditional generative adversarial network (GAN) is presented to generate proper layouts. Specifically, the discriminator is design-sequence-aware and will supervise the ""design"" process of the generator. Experimental results verify the usefulness of the new benchmark and the effectiveness of the proposed approach, which achieves the best performance by generating suitable layouts for diverse canvases.

In this work, we show that the recently proposed Deep Equilibrium Model (DEQ) can be naturally adapted to this form of computation. Our Landmark DEQ (LDEQ) achieves state-of-the-art performance on the challenging WFLW facial landmark dataset, reaching 3.92 NME with fewer parameters and a training memory cost of O(1) in the number of recurrent modules. Furthermore, we show that DEQs are particularly suited for landmark detection in videos. In this setting, it is typical to train on still images due to the lack of labelled videos. This can lead to a ""flickering"" effect at inference time on video, whereby a model can rapidly oscillate between different plausible solutions across consecutive frames. By rephrasing DEQs as a constrained optimization, we emulate recurrence at inference time, despite not having access to temporal data at training time. This Recurrence without Recurrence (RwR) paradigm helps in reducing landmark flicker, which we demonstrate by introducing a new metric, normalized mean flicker (NMF), and contributing a new facial landmark video dataset (WFLW-V) targeting landmark uncertainty.

Due to the great difficulty of collecting paired real image and 3D hair data, using synthetic data to provide prior knowledge for real domain becomes a leading solution. This unfortunately introduces the challenge of domain gap. Due to the inherent difficulty of realistic hair rendering, existing methods typically use orientation maps instead of hair images as input to bridge the gap. We firmly think an intermediate representation is essential, but we argue that orientation map using the dominant filtering-based methods is sensitive to uncertain noise and far from a competent representation. Thus, we first raise this issue up and propose a novel intermediate representation, termed as HairStep, which consists of a strand map and a depth map. It is found that HairStep not only provides sufficient information for accurate 3D hair modeling, but also is feasible to be inferred from real images. Specifically, we collect a dataset of 1,250 portrait images with two types of annotations. A learning framework is further designed to transfer real images to the strand map and depth map.

(2) Besides previous supervised or unsupervised settings, some existing video corpora can be useful, e.g., trailers, but they are often noisy and incomplete to cover the full highlights. In this work, we study a more practical and promising setting, i.e., reformulating highlight detection as ""learning with noisy labels"".

In this work, we revisit the classic stereo setup for training data collection -- capturing two images of the same scene with one UDC and one standard camera. The key idea is to ""copy"" details from a high-quality reference image and ""paste"" them on the UDC image. While being able to generate real training pairs, this setting is susceptible to spatial misalignment due to perspective and depth of field changes. The problem is further compounded by the large domain discrepancy between the UDC and normal images, which is unique to UDC restoration. In this paper, we mitigate the non-trivial domain discrepancy and spatial misalignment through a novel Transformer-based framework that generates well-aligned yet high-quality target data for the corresponding UDC input. This is made possible through two carefully designed components, namely, the Domain Alignment Module (DAM) and Geometric Alignment Module (GAM), which encourage robust and accurate discovery of correspondence between the UDC and normal views. Extensive experiments show that high-quality and well-aligned pseudo UDC training pairs are beneficial for training a robust restoration network.

However, existing works typically train on large datasets of image-text pairs and have been designed to perform downstream tasks involving only small to medium sized-images, neither of which are applicable to the emerging field of computational pathology where there are limited publicly available paired image-text datasets and each image can span up to 100,000 x 100,000 pixels in dimensions. In this paper we present MI-Zero, a simple and intuitive framework for unleashing the zero-shot transfer capabilities of contrastively aligned image and text models to gigapixel histopathology whole slide images, enabling multiple downstream diagnostic tasks to be carried out by pretrained encoders without requiring any additional labels. MI-Zero reformulates zero-shot transfer under the framework of multiple instance learning to overcome the computational challenge of inference on extremely large images. We used over 550k pathology reports and other available in-domain text corpora to pretrain our text encoder. By effectively leveraging strong pretrained encoders, our best model pretrained on over 33k histopathology image-caption pairs achieves an average median zero-shot accuracy of 70.2% across three different real-world cancer subtyping tasks.

First, most existing radiance field reconstruction approaches rely on accurate pre-estimated camera poses from Structure-from-Motion algorithms, which frequently fail on in-the-wild videos. Second, using a single, global radiance field with finite representational capacity does not scale to longer trajectories in an unbounded scene. For handling unknown poses, we jointly estimate the camera poses with radiance field in a progressive manner. We show that progressive optimization significantly improves the robustness of the reconstruction. For handling large unbounded scenes, we dynamically allocate new local radiance fields trained with frames within a temporal window. This further improves robustness (e.g., performs well even under moderate pose drifts) and allows us to scale to large scenes.

This is because collecting 3D interacting hands data in the wild is extremely challenging, even for the 2D data. We present InterWild, which brings MoCap and ITW samples to shared domains for robust 3D interacting hands recovery in the wild with a limited amount of ITW 2D/3D interacting hands data. 3D interacting hands recovery consists of two sub-problems: 1) 3D recovery of each hand and 2) 3D relative translation recovery between two hands. For the first sub-problem, we bring MoCap and ITW samples to a shared 2D scale space. Although ITW datasets provide a limited amount of 2D/3D interacting hands, they contain large-scale 2D single hand data. Motivated by this, we use a single hand image as an input for the first sub-problem regardless of whether two hands are interacting. Hence, interacting hands of MoCap datasets are brought to the 2D scale space of single hands of ITW datasets. For the second sub-problem, we bring MoCap and ITW samples to a shared appearance-invariant space. Unlike the first sub-problem, 2D labels of ITW datasets are not helpful for the second sub-problem due to the 3D translation's ambiguity. Hence, instead of relying on ITW samples, we amplify the generalizability of MoCap samples by taking only a geometric feature without an image as an input for the second sub-problem. As the geometric feature is invariant to appearances, MoCap and ITW samples do not suffer from a huge appearance gap between the two datasets.

In crowded human scenes with close-up human-robot interaction and robot navigation, a deep understanding of surrounding people requires reasoning about human motion and body dynamics over time with human body pose estimation and tracking.

In this paper, we introduce JRDB-Pose, a large-scale dataset and benchmark for multi-person pose estimation and tracking. JRDB-Pose extends the existing JRDB which includes videos captured from a social navigation robot in a university campus environment, containing challenging scenes with crowded indoor and outdoor locations and a diverse range of scales and occlusion types. JRDB-Pose provides human pose annotations with per-keypoint occlusion labels and track IDs consistent across the scene and with existing annotations in JRDB.

Previously, numerous works have been proposed to tackle this problem. However, the benchmarks used to assess these methods are relatively plain, i.e., scenarios with real-world complexity are not fully represented in these benchmarks. As the first contribution of this work, we curate and release a new dataset for VIE, in which the document images are much more challenging in that they are taken from real applications, and difficulties such as blur, partial occlusion, and printing shift are quite common. All these factors may lead to failures in information extraction. Therefore, as the second contribution, we explore an alternative approach to precisely and robustly extract key information from document images under such tough conditions. Specifically, in contrast to previous methods, which usually either incorporate visual information into a multi-modal architecture or train text spotting and information extraction in an end-to-end fashion, we explicitly model entities as semantic points, i.e., center points of entities are enriched with semantic information describing the attributes and relationships of different entities, which could largely benefit entity labeling and linking.

In such situations, RS distortion correction algorithms are critical. Recent methods rely on a constant velocity assumption and require multiple frames to predict the dense displacement field. In this work, we introduce a new method, called Eventful Shutter (EvShutter), that corrects RS artifacts using a single RGB image and event information with high temporal resolution. The method firstly removes blur using a novel flow-based deblurring module and then compensates RS using a double encoder hourglass network. In contrast to previous methods, it does not rely on a constant velocity assumption and uses a simple architecture thanks to an event transformation dedicated to RS, called Filter and Flip (FnF), that transforms input events to encode only the changes between GS and RS images. To evaluate the proposed method and facilitate future research, we collect the first dataset with real events and high-quality RS images with optional blur, called RS-ERGB. We generate the RS images from GS images using a newly proposed simulator based on adaptive interpolation. The simulator permits the use of inexpensive cameras with long exposure to capture high-quality GS images.

In this work, we perform a large-scale robustness analysis of these existing models for video action recognition. We focus on robustness against real-world distribution shift perturbations instead of adversarial perturbations. We propose four different benchmark datasets, HMDB51-P, UCF101-P, Kinetics400-P, and SSv2-P to perform this analysis. We study robustness of six state-of-the-art action recognition models against 90 different perturbations.

In this paper, we introduce a new benchmark called Generalized Referring Expression Segmentation (GRES), which extends the classic RES to allow expressions to refer to an arbitrary number of target objects. Towards this, we construct the first large-scale GRES dataset called gRefCOCO that contains multi-target, no-target, and single-target expressions.

However, event-based cameras cannot offer fine-grained texture information like conventional cameras. This unique complementarity motivates us to combine conventional frames and events for high frame rate object tracking under various challenging conditions. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end network consisting of multi-modality alignment and fusion modules to effectively combine meaningful information from both modalities at different measurement rates. The alignment module is responsible for cross-modality and cross-frame-rate alignment between frame and event modalities under the guidance of the moving cues furnished by events. While the fusion module is accountable for emphasizing valuable features and suppressing noise information by the mutual complement between the two modalities.

FMCW MIMO radar is widely used in autonomous driving alongside Lidar and RGB cameras. However, compared to Lidar, MIMO radar is usually of low resolution due to hardware size restrictions. For example, achieving 1-degree azimuth resolution requires at least 100 receivers, but a single MIMO device usually supports at most 12 receivers. Having limitations on the number of receivers is problematic since a high-resolution measurement of azimuth angle is essential for estimating the location and velocity of objects. To improve the azimuth resolution of MIMO radar, we propose a light, yet efficient, Analog-to-Digital super-resolution model (ADC-SR) that predicts or hallucinates additional radar signals using signals from only a few receivers. Compared with the baseline models that are applied to processed radar Range-Azimuth-Doppler (RAD) maps, we show that our ADC-SR method that processes raw ADC signals achieves comparable performance with 98% (50 times) fewer parameters. We also propose a hybrid super-resolution model (Hybrid-SR) combining our ADC-SR with a standard RAD super-resolution model, and show that performance can be improved by a large margin. Experiments on our City-Radar dataset and the RADIal dataset validate the importance of leveraging raw radar ADC signals.

One important editing task is the removal of unwanted objects from a 3D scene, such that the replaced region is visually plausible and consistent with its context. We refer to this task as 3D inpainting. In 3D, solutions must be both consistent across multiple views and geometrically valid. In this paper, we propose a novel 3D inpainting method that addresses these challenges. Given a small set of posed images and sparse annotations in a single input image, our framework first rapidly obtains a 3D segmentation mask for a target object. Using the mask, a perceptual optimization-based approach is then introduced that leverages learned 2D image inpainters, distilling their information into 3D space, while ensuring view consistency. We also address the lack of a diverse benchmark for evaluating 3D scene inpainting methods by introducing a dataset comprised of challenging real-world scenes. In particular, our dataset contains views of the same scene with and without a target object, enabling more principled benchmarking of the 3D inpainting task.

To solve these problems, we propose the first approach that combines deep learning and stereo polarization information to recover not only normal but also disparity.

To tap the potential of learning-based sensor noise modeling, we investigate the noise formation in a typical imaging process and propose a novel physics-guided ISO-dependent sensor noise modeling approach. Specifically, we build a normalizing flow-based framework to represent the complex noise characteristics of CMOS camera sensors. Each component of the noise model is dedicated to a particular kind of noise under the guidance of physical models. Moreover, we take into consideration of the ISO dependence in the noise model, which is not completely considered by the existing learning-based methods. For training the proposed noise model, a new dataset is further collected with paired noisy-clean images, as well as flat-field and bias frames covering a wide range of ISO settings. Compared to existing methods, the proposed noise model benefits from the flexible structure and accurate modeling capabilities, which can help achieve better denoising performance in extreme low-light scenes.

Even though previous works recognize the utility of asynchronous event information for this task, they ignore the fact that motion may or may not result in blur in the input video to be interpolated, depending on the length of the exposure time of the frames and the speed of the motion, and assume either that the input video is sharp, restricting themselves to frame interpolation, or that it is blurry, including an explicit, separate deblurring stage before interpolation in their pipeline. We instead propose a general method for event-based frame interpolation that performs deblurring ad-hoc and thus works both on sharp and blurry input videos. Our model consists in a bidirectional recurrent network that naturally incorporates the temporal dimension of interpolation and fuses information from the input frames and the events adaptively based on their temporal proximity. In addition, we introduce a novel real-world high-resolution dataset with events and color videos which provides a challenging evaluation setting for the examined task. Extensive experiments on the standard GoPro benchmark and on our dataset show that our network consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on frame interpolation, single image deblurring and the joint task of interpolation and deblurring.

In this paper, we introduce a new setting called Domain Generalization for Image Captioning (DGIC), where the data from the target domain is unseen in the learning process. We first construct a benchmark dataset for DGIC, which helps us to investigate models' domain generalization (DG) ability on unseen domains.

We tackle this tradeoff using event cameras. Event cameras operate at microseconds resolution with negligible motion blur, and output a continuous stream of events that precisely measures how light changes over time asynchronously. We propose a setup that consists of a linear polarizer rotating at high speeds in front of an event camera. Our method uses the continuous event stream caused by the rotation to reconstruct relative intensities at multiple polarizer angles. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms physics-based baselines using frames, reducing the MAE by 25% in synthetic and real-world datasets. In the real world, we observe, however, that the challenging conditions (i.e., when few events are generated) harm the performance of physics-based solutions. To overcome this, we propose a learning-based approach that learns to estimate surface normals even at low event-rates, improving the physics-based approach by 52% on the real world dataset.

Accordingly, this paper proposes the first approach for 3D-consistent, dense and photorealistic novel view synthesis using just a single colour event stream as input. At its core is a neural radiance field trained entirely in a self-supervised manner from events while preserving the original resolution of the colour event channels.

Yuille, Li Cheng","Robust and reliable semantic segmentation in complex scenes is crucial for many real-life applications such as autonomous safe driving and nighttime rescue. In most approaches, it is typical to make use of RGB images as input. They however work well only in preferred weather conditions; when facing adverse conditions such as rainy, overexposure, or low-light, they often fail to deliver satisfactory results. This has led to the recent investigation into multispectral semantic segmentation, where RGB and thermal infrared (RGBT) images are both utilized as input. This gives rise to significantly more robust segmentation of image objects in complex scenes and under adverse conditions. Nevertheless, the present focus in single RGBT image input restricts existing methods from well addressing dynamic real-world scenes. Motivated by the above observations, in this paper, we set out to address a relatively new task of semantic segmentation of multispectral video input, which we refer to as Multispectral Video Semantic Segmentation, or MVSS in short. An in-house MVSeg dataset is thus curated, consisting of 738 calibrated RGB and thermal videos, accompanied by 3,545 fine-grained pixel-level semantic annotations of 26 categories. Our dataset contains a wide range of challenging urban scenes in both daytime and nighttime. Moreover, we propose an effective MVSS baseline, dubbed MVNet, which is to our knowledge the first model to jointly learn semantic representations from multispectral and temporal contexts.

Nevertheless, the latency of vision-centric approaches is too high for practical deployment (e.g., most camera-based 3D detectors have a runtime greater than 300ms). To bridge the gap between ideal researches and real-world applications, it is necessary to quantify the trade-off between performance and efficiency. Traditionally, autonomous-driving perception benchmarks perform the online evaluation, neglecting the inference time delay. To mitigate the problem, we propose the Autonomous-driving StreAming Perception (ASAP) benchmark, which is the first benchmark to evaluate the online performance of vision-centric perception in autonomous driving. On the basis of the 2Hz annotated nuScenes dataset, we first propose an annotation-extending pipeline to generate high-frame-rate labels for the 12Hz raw images.

In this paper, we propose the GeneCIS ('genesis') benchmark, which measures models' ability to adapt to a range of similarity conditions. Extending prior work, our benchmark is designed for zero-shot evaluation only, and hence considers an open-set of similarity conditions.

Despite this some studies have directly used CLIP's image encoder for tasks like few-shot classification introducing a misalignment between its pre-training objectives and feature extraction methods. This inconsistency can diminish the quality of the image's feature representation adversely affecting CLIP's effectiveness in target tasks. In this paper we view text features as precise neighbors of image features in CLIP's space and present a novel CrOss-moDal nEighbor Representation (CODER) based on the distance structure between images and their neighbor texts.

EASGs extend standard manually-annotated representations of egocentric videos such as verb-noun action labels by providing a temporally evolving graph-based description of the actions performed by the camera wearer including interacted objects their relationships and how actions unfold in time. Through a novel annotation procedure we extend the Ego4D dataset adding manually labeled Egocentric Action Scene Graphs which offer a rich set of annotations for long-from egocentric video understanding. We hence define the EASG generation task and provide a baseline approach establishing preliminary benchmarks.

However existing video reasoning benchmarks are still inadequate since they were mainly designed for factual or situated reasoning and rarely involve broader knowledge in the real world. Our work aims to delve deeper into reasoning evaluations specifically within dynamic open-world and structured context knowledge. We propose a new benchmark (SOK-Bench) consisting of 44K questions and 10K situations with instance-level annotations depicted in the videos. The reasoning process is required to understand and apply situated knowledge and general knowledge for problem-solving. To create such a dataset we propose an automatic and scalable generation method to generate question-answer pairs knowledge graphs and rationales by instructing the combinations of LLMs and MLLMs. Concretely we first extract observable situated entities relations and processes from videos for situated knowledge and then extend to open-world knowledge beyond the visible content. The task generation is facilitated through multiple dialogues as iterations and subsequently corrected and refined by our designed self-promptings and demonstrations. With a corpus of both explicit situated facts and implicit commonsense we generate associated question-answer pairs and reasoning processes finally followed by manual reviews for quality assurance. We evaluated recent mainstream large vision language models on the benchmark and found several insightful conclusions.

Anomaly detection (AD) methods serve as robust tools for this purpose. However existing public datasets primarily consist of images without anomalies limiting the practical application of AD methods in production settings. To address this challenge we present (1) the Valeo Anomaly Dataset (VAD) a novel real-world industrial dataset comprising 5000 images including 2000 instances of challenging real defects across more than 20 subclasses. Acknowledging that traditional AD methods struggle with this dataset we introduce (2) Segmentation-based Anomaly Detector (SegAD). First SegAD leverages anomaly maps as well as segmentation maps to compute local statistics. Next SegAD uses these statistics and an optional supervised classifier score as input features for a Boosted Random Forest (BRF) classifier yielding the final anomaly score. Our SegAD achieves state-of-the-art performance on both VAD (+2.1% AUROC) and the VisA dataset (+0.4% AUROC).

Despite the practical successes achieved the outstanding performance of most virtual staining methods relies on hard-to-obtain paired images in training. In this paper we propose a method for virtual immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining named confusion-GAN which does not require paired images and can achieve comparable performance to supervised algorithms. Specifically we propose a multi-branch discriminator which judges if the features of generated images can be embedded into the feature pool of target domain images to improve the visual quality of generated images. Meanwhile we also propose a novel patch-level pathology information extractor which is assisted by multiple instance learning to ensure pathological consistency during virtual staining. Extensive experiments were conducted on three types of IHC images including a high-resolution hepatocellular carcinoma immunohistochemical dataset proposed by us. The results demonstrated that our proposed confusion-GAN can generate highly realistic images that are capable of deceiving even experienced pathologists. Furthermore compared to using H&E images directly the downstream diagnosis achieved higher accuracy when using images generated by confusion-GAN.

Recent approaches favor learning policies from simulated or collected data wherein appropriate actions are more frequently selected when the recognition is accurate. However most recognition modules are developed under the closed-world assumption which makes them ill-equipped to handle unexpected inputs such as the absence of the target object in the current observation. To address this issue we propose treating active recognition as a sequential evidence-gathering process providing by-step uncertainty quantification and reliable prediction under the evidence combination theory. Additionally the reward function developed in this paper effectively characterizes the merit of actions when operating in open-world environments. To evaluate the performance we collect a dataset from an indoor simulator encompassing various recognition challenges such as distance occlusion levels and visibility. Through a series of experiments on recognition and robustness analysis we demonstrate the necessity of introducing uncertainties to active recognition and the superior performance of the proposed method.,True,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Ma_Continuous_Pose_for_Monocular_Cameras_in_Neural_Implicit_Representation_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf

We present a novel transformer-based method for GFIQA which is aided by two unique mechanisms. First a novel Dual-Set Degradation Representation Learning (DSL) mechanism uses facial images with both synthetic and real degradations to decouple degradation from content ensuring generalizability to real-world scenarios. This self-supervised method learns degradation features on a global scale providing a robust alternative to conventional methods that use local patch information in degradation learning. Second our transformer leverages facial landmarks to emphasize visually salient parts of a face image in evaluating its perceptual quality. We also introduce a balanced and diverse Comprehensive Generic Face IQA (CGFIQA-40k) dataset of 40K images carefully designed to overcome the biases in particular the imbalances in skin tone and gender representation in existing datasets.

However their potential in the medical domain remains largely unexplored. A significant challenge arises from the scarcity of diverse medical images spanning various modalities and anatomical regions which is essential in real-world medical applications. To solve this problem in this paper we introduce OmniMedVQA a novel comprehensive medical Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmark. This benchmark is collected from 73 different medical datasets including 12 different modalities and covering more than 20 distinct anatomical regions. Importantly all images in this benchmark are sourced from authentic medical scenarios ensuring alignment with the requirements of the medical field and suitability for evaluating LVLMs. Through our extensive experiments we have found that existing LVLMs struggle to address these medical VQA problems effectively. Moreover what surprises us is that medical-specialized LVLMs even exhibit inferior performance to those general-domain models calling for a more versatile and robust LVLM in the biomedical field. The evaluation results not only reveal the current limitations of LVLM in understanding real medical images but also highlight our dataset's significance.

Recently various methods and datasets have showcased the feasibility of dance synthesis. However camera movement synthesis with music and dance remains an unsolved challenging problem due to the scarcity of paired data. Thus we present DCM a new multi-modal 3D dataset which for the first time combines camera movement with dance motion and music audio. This dataset encompasses 108 dance sequences (3.2 hours) of paired dance-camera-music data from the anime community covering 4 music genres. With this dataset we uncover that dance camera movement is multifaceted and human-centric and possesses multiple influencing factors making dance camera synthesis a more challenging task compared to camera or dance synthesis alone. To overcome these difficulties we propose DanceCamera3D a transformer-based diffusion model that incorporates a novel body attention loss and a condition separation strategy. For evaluation we devise new metrics measuring camera movement quality diversity and dancer fidelity.

This requires time-consuming and costly video annotation mechanisms. We propose a novel Point-VOS task with a spatio-temporally sparse point-wise annotation scheme that substantially reduces the annotation effort. We apply our annotation scheme to two large-scale video datasets with text descriptions and annotate over 19M points across 133K objects in 32K videos. Based on our annotations we propose a new Point-VOS benchmark and a corresponding point-based training mechanism which we use to establish strong baseline results. We show that existing VOS methods can easily be adapted to leverage our point annotations during training and can achieve results close to the fully-supervised performance when trained on pseudo-masks generated from these points.

Recent data-driven metrics have demonstrated a stronger correlation with human judgments than classic metrics such as CIDEr; however they lack sufficient capabilities to handle hallucinations and generalize across diverse images and texts partially because they compute scalar similarities merely using embeddings learned from tasks unrelated to image captioning evaluation. In this study we propose Polos a supervised automatic evaluation metric for image captioning models. Polos computes scores from multimodal inputs using a parallel feature extraction mechanism that leverages embeddings trained through large-scale contrastive learning. To train Polos we introduce Multimodal Metric Learning from Human Feedback (M2LHF) a framework for developing metrics based on human feedback. We constructed the Polaris dataset which comprises 131K human judgments from 550 evaluators which is approximately ten times larger than standard datasets.

To this effect we present the Industrial Plenoptic Dataset (IPD): the first dataset for the co-evaluation of cameras HDR and algorithms targeted at reliable high-accuracy industrial automation. Specifically we capture 2300 physical scenes of 20 industrial parts covering a 1mx1mx0.5m working volume resulting in over 100000 distinct object views.

Notably the established COCO benchmark has propelled the development of modern detection and segmentation systems. However the COCO segmentation benchmark has seen comparatively slow improvement over the last decade. Originally equipped with coarse polygon annotations for thing instances it gradually incorporated coarse superpixel annotations for stuff regions which were subsequently heuristically amalgamated to yield panoptic segmentation annotations. These annotations executed by different groups of raters have resulted not only in coarse segmentation masks but also in inconsistencies between segmentation types. In this study we undertake a comprehensive reevaluation of the COCO segmentation annotations. By enhancing the annotation quality and expanding the dataset to encompass 383K images with more than 5.18M panoptic masks we introduce COCONut the COCO Next Universal segmenTation dataset. COCONut harmonizes segmentation annotations across semantic instance and panoptic segmentation with meticulously crafted high-quality masks and establishes a robust benchmark for all segmentation tasks.

Yet a prevalent limitation of supervised learning techniques remains the need for extensive manual annotations by experts. In this work we explore the potential of generative image diffusion to address the scarcity of annotated data in earth observation tasks. The main idea is to learn the joint data manifold of images and labels leveraging recent advancements in denoising diffusion probabilistic models. To the best of our knowledge we are the first to generate both images and corresponding masks for satellite segmentation. We find that the obtained pairs not only display high quality in fine-scale features but also ensure a wide sampling diversity. Both aspects are crucial for earth observation data where semantic classes can vary severely in scale and occurrence frequency. We employ the novel data instances for downstream segmentation as a form of data augmentation. In our experiments we provide comparisons to prior works based on discriminative diffusion models or GANs.

Existing methods are mostly trained on synthetic datasets which perform poorly in real scenes. In this work to facilitate the development of real-world HDR video reconstruction we present Real-HDRV a large-scale real-world benchmark dataset for HDR video reconstruction featuring various scenes diverse motion patterns and high-quality labels. Specifically our dataset contains 500 LDRs-HDRs video pairs comprising about 28000 LDR frames and 4000 HDR labels covering daytime nighttime indoor and outdoor scenes. To our best knowledge our dataset is the largest real-world HDR video reconstruction dataset. Correspondingly we propose an end-to-end network for HDR video reconstruction where a novel two-stage strategy is designed to perform alignment sequentially. Specifically the first stage performs global alignment with the adaptively estimated global offsets reducing the difficulty of subsequent alignment. The second stage implicitly performs local alignment in a coarse-to-fine manner at the feature level using the adaptive separable convolution.

Unlike current general-purpose foundation models that are stuck in the dilemma of inferior quality and text-image misalignment for humans CosmicMan enables generating photo-realistic human images with meticulous appearance reasonable structure and precise text-image alignment with detailed dense descriptions. At the heart of CosmicMan's success are the new reflections and perspectives on data and models: (1) We found that data quality and a scalable data production flow are essential for the final results from trained models. Hence we propose a new data production paradigm Annotate Anyone which serves as a perpetual data flywheel to produce high-quality data with accurate yet cost-effective annotations over time. Based on this we constructed a large-scale dataset CosmicMan-HQ 1.0 with 6 Million high-quality real-world human images in a mean resolution of 1488x1255 and attached with precise text annotations deriving from 115 Million attributes in diverse granularities. (2) We argue that a text-to-image foundation model specialized for humans must be pragmatic - easy to integrate into down-streaming tasks while effective in producing high-quality human images. Hence we propose to model the relationship between dense text descriptions and image pixels in a decomposed manner and present Decomposed-Attention-Refocusing (Daring) training framework. It seamlessly decomposes the cross-attention features in existing text-to-image diffusion model and enforces attention refocusing without adding extra modules.

This work instead develops a novel Day-Night Dual-domain Modulation (DNDM) vehicle re-identification framework for day-night cross-domain traffic scenarios. Specifically a unique night-domain glare suppression module is provided to attenuate the headlight glare from raw nighttime vehicle images. To enhance vehicle features under low-light environments we propose a dual-domain structure enhancement module in the feature extractor which enhances geometric structures between appearance features. To alleviate day-night domain discrepancies we develop a cross-domain class awareness module that facilitates the interaction between appearance and structure features in both domains.

To address this gap we release the FlyLight Instance Segmentation Benchmark (FISBe) dataset the first publicly available multi-neuron light microscopy dataset with pixel-wise annotations. In addition we define a set of instance segmentation metrics for benchmarking that we designed to be meaningful with regard to downstream analyses. Lastly we provide three baselines to kick off a competition that we envision to both advance the field of machine learning regarding methodology for capturing long-range data dependencies and facilitate scientific discovery in basic neuroscience.,True,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Qin_LangSplat_3D_Language_Gaussian_Splatting_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
CVPR-2024-851,cvpr,2024,Bridging Remote Sensors with Multisensor Geospatial Foundation Models,"Boran Han, Shuai Zhang, Xingjian Shi, Markus Reichstein",In the realm of geospatial analysis the diversity of remote sensors encompassing both optical and microwave technologies offers a wealth of distinct observational capabilities. Recognizing this we present msGFM a multisensor geospatial foundation model that effectively unifies data from four key sensor modalities. This integration spans an expansive dataset of two million multisensor images. msGFM is uniquely adept at handling both paired and unpaired sensor data. For data originating from identical geolocations our model employs an innovative cross-sensor pretraining approach in masked image modeling enabling the synthesis of joint representations from diverse sensors. msGFM incorporating four remote sensors upholds strong performance forming a comprehensive model adaptable to various sensor types. msGFM has demonstrated enhanced proficiency in a range of both single-sensor and multisensor downstream tasks. These include scene classification segmentation cloud removal and pan-sharpening. A key discovery of our research is that representations derived from natural images are not always compatible with the distinct characteristics of geospatial remote sensors underscoring the limitations of existing representations in this field. Our work can serve as a guide for developing multisensor geospatial pretraining models paving the way for more advanced geospatial capabilities.

In this paper we investigate this task from a few-shot unconstrained photo album. The reconstruction of human avatars from such data sources is challenging because of limited data amount and dynamic articulated poses. For handling dynamic data we integrate a skinning mechanism with deep marching tetrahedra (DMTet) to form a drivable tetrahedral representation which drives arbitrary mesh topologies generated by the DMTet for the adaptation of unconstrained images. To effectively mine instructive information from few-shot data we devise a two-phase optimization method with few-shot reference and few-shot guidance. The former focuses on aligning avatar identity with reference images while the latter aims to generate plausible appearances for unseen regions. Overall our framework called HaveFun can undertake avatar reconstruction rendering and animation. Extensive experiments on our developed benchmarks demonstrate that HaveFun exhibits substantially superior performance in reconstructing the human body and hand.,True,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Bello_Novel_View_Synthesis_with_View-Dependent_Effects_from_a_Single_Image_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
CVPR-2024-2046,cvpr,2024,Depth-Aware Concealed Crop Detection in Dense Agricultural Scenes,"Liqiong Wang, Jinyu Yang, Yanfu Zhang, Fangyi Wang, Feng Zheng",Concealed Object Detection (COD) aims to identify objects visually embedded in their background. Existing COD datasets and methods predominantly focus on animals or humans ignoring the agricultural domain which often contains numerous small and concealed crops with severe occlusions. In this paper we introduce Concealed Crop Detection (CCD) which extends classic COD to agricultural domains. Experimental study shows that unimodal data provides insufficient information for CCD. To address this gap we first collect a large-scale RGB-D dataset ACOD-12K containing high-resolution crop images and depth maps. Then we propose a foundational framework named Recurrent Iterative Segmentation Network (RISNet). To tackle the challenge of dense objects we employ multi-scale receptive fields to capture objects of varying sizes thus enhancing the detection performance for dense objects. By fusing depth features our method can acquire spatial information about concealed objects to mitigate disturbances caused by intricate backgrounds and occlusions. Furthermore our model adopts a multi-stage iterative approach using predictions from each stage as gate attention to reinforce position information thereby improving the detection accuracy for small objects. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our RISNet achieves new state-of-the-art performance on both newly proposed CCD and classic COD tasks.

While easy to collect synthetic data often fall short in realism and fail to capture authentic clothing dynamics. Addressing this gap we introduce 4D-DRESS the first real-world 4D dataset advancing human clothing research with its high-quality 4D textured scans and garment meshes. 4D-DRESS captures 64 outfits in 520 human motion sequences amounting to 78k textured scans. Creating a real-world clothing dataset is challenging particularly in annotating and segmenting the extensive and complex 4D human scans. To address this we develop a semi-automatic 4D human parsing pipeline. We efficiently combine a human-in-the-loop process with automation to accurately label 4D scans in diverse garments and body movements. Leveraging precise annotations and high-quality garment meshes we establish several benchmarks for clothing simulation and reconstruction. 4D-DRESS offers realistic and challenging data that complements synthetic sources paving the way for advancements in research of lifelike human clothing.

However existing technical approaches for analyzing and synthesizing hand-object manipulation are mostly limited to handling a single hand and object due to the lack of data support. To address this we construct TACO an extensive bimanual hand-object-interaction dataset spanning a large variety of tool-action-object compositions for daily human activities. TACO contains 2.5K motion sequences paired with third-person and egocentric views precise hand-object 3D meshes and action labels. To rapidly expand the data scale we present a fully automatic data acquisition pipeline combining multi-view sensing with an optical motion capture system. With the vast research fields provided by TACO we benchmark three generalizable hand-object-interaction tasks: compositional action recognition generalizable hand-object motion forecasting and cooperative grasp synthesis. Extensive experiments reveal new insights challenges and opportunities for advancing the studies of generalizable hand-object motion analysis and synthesis.

RL requires extensive reward shaping and auxiliary losses and is often too slow and ineffective for long-horizon tasks. While IL with human supervision is effective collecting human trajectories at scale is extremely expensive. In this work we show that imitating shortest-path planners in simulation produces agents that given a language instruction can proficiently navigate explore and manipulate objects in both simulation and in the real world using only RGB sensors (no depth map or GPS coordinates). This surprising result is enabled by our end-to-end transformer-based SPOC architecture powerful visual encoders paired with extensive image augmentation and the dramatic scale and diversity of our training data: millions of frames of shortest-path-expert trajectories collected inside approximately 200000 procedurally generated houses containing 40000 unique 3D assets.

However conventional robustness benchmarks rely on perturbations in digitized images diverging from distribution shifts occurring in the image acquisition process. To bridge this gap we introduce a new distribution shift dataset ImageNet-ES comprising variations in environmental and camera sensor factors by directly capturing 202k images with a real camera in a controllable testbed. With the new dataset we evaluate out-of-distribution (OOD) detection and model robustness. We find that existing OOD detection methods do not cope with the covariate shifts in ImageNet-ES implying that the definition and detection of OOD should be revisited to embrace real-world distribution shifts. We also observe that the model becomes more robust in both ImageNet-C and -ES by learning environment and sensor variations in addition to existing digital augmentations. Lastly our results suggest that effective shift mitigation via camera sensor control can significantly improve performance without increasing model size. With these findings our benchmark may aid future research on robustness OOD and camera sensor control for computer vision.

Feder Cooper, Jasmine Collins, Landan Seguin, Austin Jacobson, Mihir Patel, Jonathan Frankle, Cory Stephenson, Volodymyr Kuleshov",We train a set of open text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models on a dataset of curated Creative-Commons-licensed (CC) images which yields models that are competitive with Stable Diffusion 2 (SD2). This task presents two challenges: (1) high-resolution CC images lack the captions necessary to train T2I models; (2) CC images are relatively scarce. To address these challenges we use an intuitive transfer learning technique to produce a set of high-quality synthetic captions paired with our assembled CC images. We then develop a data- and compute-efficient training recipe that requires as little as 3% of the LAION data (i.e. roughly 70 million examples) needed to train existing SD2 models but obtains the same quality. These results indicate that we have a sufficient number of CC images (also roughly 70 million) for training high-quality models. Our recipe also implements a variety of optimizations that achieve 2.71x training speed-ups enabling rapid model iteration. We leverage this recipe to train several high-quality T2I mod- els which we dub the CommonCanvas family. Our largest model achieves comparable performance to SD2 on human evaluation even though we use a synthetically captioned CC-image dataset that is only <3% the size of LAION for training.

CVPR-2024-618,cvpr,2024,Pink: Unveiling the Power of Referential Comprehension for Multi-modal LLMs,"Shiyu Xuan, Qingpei Guo, Ming Yang, Shiliang Zhang",Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in various multi-modal tasks. Nevertheless their performance in fine-grained image understanding tasks is still limited. To address this issue this paper proposes a new framework to enhance the fine-grained image understanding abilities of MLLMs. Specifically we present a new method for constructing the instruction tuning dataset at a low cost by leveraging annotations in existing datasets. A self-consistent bootstrapping method is also introduced to extend existing dense object annotations into high-quality referring-expression-bounding-box pairs. These methods enable the generation of high-quality instruction data which includes a wide range of fundamental abilities essential for fine-grained image perception. Moreover we argue that the visual encoder should be tuned during instruction tuning to mitigate the gap between full image perception and fine-grained image perception. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of our method. For instance our model exhibits a 5.2% accuracy improvement over Qwen-VL on GQA and surpasses the accuracy of Kosmos-2 by 24.7% on RefCOCO_val. We have also attained the top rank on the leaderboard of MMBench. This promising performance is achieved by training on only publicly available data making it easily reproducible.

Recent methods for co-speech gesture generation while managing to generate beat-aligned motions struggle generating gestures that are semantically aligned with the utterance. Compared to beat gestures that align naturally to the audio signal semantically coherent gestures require modeling the complex interactions between the language and human motion and can be controlled by focusing on certain words. Therefore we present ConvoFusion a diffusion-based approach for multi-modal gesture synthesis which can not only generate gestures based on multi-modal speech inputs but can also facilitate controllability in gesture synthesis. Our method proposes two guidance objectives that allow the users to modulate the impact of different conditioning modalities (e.g. audio vs text) as well as to choose certain words to be emphasized during gesturing. Our method is versatile in that it can be trained either for generating monologue gestures or even the conversational gestures. To further advance the research on multi-party interactive gestures the DnD Group Gesture dataset is released which contains 6 hours of gesture data showing 5 people interacting with one another. We compare our method with several recent works and demonstrate effectiveness of our method on a variety of tasks.

Recent generative methods lack lighting control which is crucial to numerous artistic aspects of image generation such as setting the overall mood or cinematic appearance. To overcome these limitations we propose to condition the generation on shading and normal maps. We model the lighting with single bounce shading which includes cast shadows. We first train a shading estimation module to generate a dataset of real-world images and shading pairs. Then we train a control network using the estimated shading and normals as input. Our method demonstrates high-quality image generation and lighting control in numerous scenes. Additionally we use our generated dataset to train an identity-preserving relighting model conditioned on an image and a target shading. Our method is the first that enables the generation of images with controllable consistent lighting and performs on par with specialized relighting state-of-the-art methods.,True,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Bao_GeneAvatar_Generic_Expression-Aware_Volumetric_Head_Avatar_Editing_from_a_Single_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf

This high image-generation capability has stimulated the creation of many downstream applications in various areas. However we find that this technology is actually a double-edged sword: We identify a new type of attack called the Natural Denoising Diffusion (NDD) attack based on the finding that state-of-the-art deep neural network (DNN) models still hold their prediction even if we intentionally remove their robust features which are essential to the human visual system (HVS) through text prompts. The NDD attack shows a significantly high capability to generate low-cost model-agnostic and transferable adversarial attacks by exploiting the natural attack capability in diffusion models. To systematically evaluate the risk of the NDD attack we perform a large-scale empirical study with our newly created dataset the Natural Denoising Diffusion Attack (NDDA) dataset. We evaluate the natural attack capability by answering 6 research questions. Through a user study we find that it can achieve an 88% detection rate while being stealthy to 93% of human subjects; we also find that the non-robust features embedded by diffusion models contribute to the natural attack capability. To confirm the model-agnostic and transferable attack capability we perform the NDD attack against the Tesla Model 3 and find that 73% of the physically printed attacks can be detected as stop signs. Our hope is that the study and dataset can help our community be aware of the risks in diffusion models and facilitate further research toward robust DNN models.,True,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Li_Construct_to_Associate_Cooperative_Context_Learning_for_Domain_Adaptive_Point_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf

This integration augments the capacity of LLMs for tasks requiring visual comprehension and reasoning. However the extent and limitations of their enhanced abilities are not fully understood especially when it comes to real-world tasks. To address this gap we introduce GlitchBench a novel benchmark derived from video game quality assurance tasks to test and evaluate the reasoning capabilities of LMMs. Our benchmark is curated from a variety of unusual and glitched scenarios from video games and aims to challenge both the visual and linguistic reasoning powers of LMMs in detecting and interpreting out-of-the-ordinary events.

CVPR-2024-859,cvpr,2024,Low-Resource Vision Challenges for Foundation Models,"Yunhua Zhang, Hazel Doughty, Cees G. M. Snoek",Low-resource settings are well-established in natural lan- guage processing where many languages lack sufficient data for deep learning at scale. However low-resource problems are under-explored in computer vision. In this paper we address this gap and explore the challenges of low-resource image tasks with vision foundation models. We first collect a benchmark of genuinely low-resource image data covering historic maps circuit diagrams and mechanical drawings. These low-resource settings all share three challenges: data scarcity fine-grained differences and the distribution shift from natural images to the specialized domain of interest. While existing foundation models have shown impressive generalizability we find they cannot transfer well to our low-resource tasks. To begin to tackle the challenges of low-resource vision we introduce one simple baseline per challenge. Specifically we i) enlarge the data space by generative models ii) adopt the best sub-kernels to encode local regions for fine-grained difference discovery and iii) learn attention for specialized domains. Experiments on our three low-resource tasks demonstrate our proposals already provide a better baseline than transfer learning data aug- mentation and fine-grained methods. This highlights the unique characteristics and challenges of low-resource vision for foundation models that warrant further investigation.

O. Cruz, Marc-André Carbonneau",Reconstructing an avatar from a portrait image has many applications in multimedia but remains a challenging research problem. Extracting reflectance maps and geometry from one image is ill-posed: recovering geometry is a one-to-many mapping problem and reflectance and light are difficult to disentangle. Accurate geometry and reflectance can be captured under the controlled conditions of a light stage but it is costly to acquire large datasets in this fashion. Moreover training solely with this type of data leads to poor generalization with in-the-wild images. This motivates the introduction of MoSAR a method for 3D avatar generation from monocular images. We propose a semi-supervised training scheme that improves generalization by learning from both light stage and in-the-wild datasets. This is achieved using a novel differentiable shading formulation. We show that our approach effectively disentangles the intrinsic face parameters producing relightable avatars. As a result MoSAR estimates a richer set of skin reflectance maps and generates more realistic avatars than existing state-of-the-art methods. We also release a new dataset that provides intrinsic face attributes (diffuse specular ambient occlusion and translucency maps) for 10k subjects.,True,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Tarasiou_Locally_Adaptive_Neural_3D_Morphable_Models_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf

However the lack of this visual search mechanism in current multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) hinders their ability to focus on important visual details especially when handling high-resolution and visually crowded images. To address this we introduce V* an LLM-guided visual search mechanism that employs the world knowledge in LLMs for efficient visual querying. When combined with an MLLM this mechanism enhances collaborative reasoning contextual understanding and precise visual grounding. This integration results in a new MLLM meta-architecture named Show sEArch and TelL (SEAL).

However existing roadside perception approaches only focus on the single-infrastructure sensor system which cannot realize a comprehensive understanding of a traffic area because of the limited sensing range and blind spots. Orienting high-quality roadside perception we need Roadside Cooperative Perception (RCooper) to achieve practical area-coverage roadside perception for restricted traffic areas. Rcooper has its own domain-specific challenges but further exploration is hindered due to the lack of datasets. We hence release the first real-world large-scale RCooper dataset to bloom the research on practical roadside cooperative perception including detection and tracking. The manually annotated dataset comprises 50k images and 30k point clouds including two representative traffic scenes (i.e. intersection and corridor).

However such general-domain VLMs perform poorly for Remote Sensing (RS) scenarios leading to inaccurate or fabricated information when presented with RS domain-specific queries. Such a behavior emerges due to the unique challenges introduced by RS imagery. For example to handle high-resolution RS imagery with diverse scale changes across categories and many small objects region-level reasoning is necessary alongside holistic scene interpretation. Furthermore the lack of domain-specific multimodal instruction following data as well as strong backbone models for RS make it hard for the models to align their behavior with user queries. To address these limitations we propose GeoChat - the first versatile remote sensing VLM that offers multitask conversational capabilities with high-resolution RS images. Specifically GeoChat can not only answer image-level queries but also accepts region inputs to hold region-specific dialogue. Furthermore it can visually ground objects in its responses by referring to their spatial coordinates. To address the lack of domain-specific datasets we generate a novel RS multimodal instruction-following dataset by extending image-text pairs from existing diverse RS datasets. Leveraging this rich dataset we fine-tune our remote sensing VLM based on the LLaVA-1.5 architecture. We establish a comprehensive benchmark for RS multitask conversations and compare with a number of baseline methods. GeoChat demonstrates robust zero-shot performance on various remote sensing tasks e.g. image and region captioning visual question answering scene classification visually grounded conversations and referring object detection.

Additionally generating 3D cities is more complex than 3D natural scenes since buildings as objects of the same class exhibit a wider range of appearances compared to the relatively consistent appearance of objects like trees in natural scenes. To address these challenges we propose CityDreamer a compositional generative model designed specifically for unbounded 3D cities. Our key insight is that 3D city generation should be a composition of different types of neural fields: 1) various building instances and 2) background stuff such as roads and green lands. Specifically we adopt the bird's eye view scene representation and employ a volumetric render for both instance-oriented and stuff-oriented neural fields. The generative hash grid and periodic positional embedding are tailored as scene parameterization to suit the distinct characteristics of building instances and background stuff. Furthermore we contribute a suite of CityGen Datasets including OSM and GoogleEarth which comprises a vast amount of real-world city imagery to enhance the realism of the generated 3D cities both in their layouts and appearances.

Tan",Nighttime conditions pose a significant challenge to color constancy due to the diversity of lighting conditions and the presence of substantial low-light noise. Existing color constancy methods struggle with nighttime scenes frequently leading to imprecise light color estimations. To tackle nighttime color constancy we propose a novel unsupervised domain adaptation approach that utilizes labeled daytime data to facilitate learning on unlabeled nighttime images. To specifically address the unique lighting conditions of nighttime and ensure the robustness of pseudo labels we propose adaptive channel masking and light uncertainty. By selectively masking channels that are less sensitive to lighting conditions adaptive channel masking directs the model to progressively focus on features less affected by variations in light colors and noise. Additionally our model leverages light uncertainty to provide a pixel-wise uncertainty estimation regarding light color prediction which helps avoid learning from incorrect labels.

CVPR-2024-444,cvpr,2024,Investigating Compositional Challenges in Vision-Language Models for Visual Grounding,"Yunan Zeng, Yan Huang, Jinjin Zhang, Zequn Jie, Zhenhua Chai, Liang Wang",Pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved high performance on various downstream tasks which have been widely used for visual grounding tasks in a weakly supervised manner. However despite the performance gains contributed by large vision and language pre-training we find that state-of-the-art VLMs struggle with compositional reasoning on grounding tasks. To demonstrate this we propose Attribute Relation and Priority grounding (ARPGrounding) benchmark to test VLMs' compositional reasoning ability on visual grounding tasks. ARPGrounding contains 11425 samples and evaluates the compositional understanding of VLMs in three dimensions: 1) attribute denoting comprehension of objects' properties; 2) relation indicating an understanding of relation between objects; 3) priority reflecting an awareness of the part of speech associated with nouns. Using the ARPGrounding benchmark we evaluate several mainstream VLMs. We empirically find that these models perform quite well on conventional visual grounding datasets achieving performance comparable to or surpassing state-of-the-art methods but showing strong deficiencies in compositional reasoning. Furthermore we propose a composition-aware fine-tuning pipeline demonstrating the potential to leverage cost-effective image-text annotations for enhancing the compositional understanding of VLMs in grounding tasks.,True,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Zhu_CosalPure_Learning_Concept_from_Group_Images_for_Robust_Co-Saliency_Detection_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf

However identifying objects and their parts only constitutes an intermediate step towards a more fine-grained goal which is effectively interacting with the functional interactive elements (e.g. handles knobs buttons) in the scene to accomplish diverse tasks. To this end we introduce SceneFun3D a large-scale dataset with more than 14.8k highly accurate interaction annotations for 710 high-resolution real-world 3D indoor scenes. We accompany the annotations with motion parameter information describing how to interact with these elements and a diverse set of natural language descriptions of tasks that involve manipulating them in the scene context. To showcase the value of our dataset we introduce three novel tasks namely functionality segmentation task-driven affordance grounding and 3D motion estimation and adapt existing state-of-the-art methods to tackle them. Our experiments show that solving these tasks in real 3D scenes remains challenging despite recent progress in closed-set and open-set 3D scene understanding methods.,True,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Liu_Shadow_Generation_for_Composite_Image_Using_Diffusion_Model_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf

Yao, Belinda Zeng, Mubarak Shah, Trishul Chilimbi",In this paper we propose VidLA an approach for video-language alignment at scale. There are two major limitations of previous video-language alignment approaches. First they do not capture both short-range and long-range temporal dependencies and typically employ complex hierarchical deep network architectures that are hard to integrate with existing pretrained image-text foundation models. To effectively address this limitation we instead keep the network architecture simple and use a set of data tokens that operate at different temporal resolutions in a hierarchical manner accounting for the temporally hierarchical nature of videos. By employing a simple two-tower architecture we are able to initialize our video-language model with pretrained image-text foundation models thereby boosting the final performance. Second existing video-language alignment works struggle due to the lack of semantically aligned large-scale training data. To overcome it we leverage recent LLMs to curate the largest video-language dataset to date with better visual grounding. Furthermore unlike existing video-text datasets which only contain short clips our dataset is enriched with video clips of varying durations to aid our temporally hierarchical data tokens in extracting better representations at varying temporal scales. Overall empirical results show that our proposed approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods on multiple retrieval benchmarks especially on longer videos and performs competitively on classification benchmarks.,True,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Lee_Multi-criteria_Token_Fusion_with_One-step-ahead_Attention_for_Efficient_Vision_Transformers_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf

However this challenging problem requires accurate modeling of the contact between hands and objects.To capture grasps existing methods use skeletons meshes or parametric models that does not represent hand shape accurately resulting in inaccurate contacts. We present MANUS a method for Markerless Hand-Object Grasp Capture using Articulated 3D Gaussians. We build a novel articulated 3D Gaussians representation that extends 3D Gaussian splatting for high-fidelity representation of articulating hands. Since our representation uses Gaussian primitives optimized from the multi-view pixel-aligned losses it enables us to efficiently and accurately estimate contacts between the hand and the object. For the most accurate results our method requires tens of camera views that current datasets do not provide. We therefore build MANUS-Grasps a new dataset that contains hand-object grasps viewed from 50+ cameras across 30+ scenes 3 subjects and comprising over 7M frames. In addition to extensive qualitative results we also show that our method outperforms others on a quantitative contact evaluation method that uses paint transfer from the object to the hand.,True,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Wang_Unsupervised_3D_Structure_Inference_from_Category-Specific_Image_Collections_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf

Rehg, Chao Zheng",Vision-language generative AI has demonstrated remarkable promise for empowering cross-modal scene understanding of autonomous driving and high-definition (HD) map systems. However current benchmark datasets lack multi-modal point cloud image and language data pairs. Recent approaches utilize visual instruction learning and cross-modal prompt engineering to expand vision-language models into this domain. In this paper we propose a new vision-language benchmark that can be used to finetune traffic and HD map domain-specific foundation models. Specifically we annotate and leverage large-scale broad-coverage traffic and map data extracted from huge HD map annotations and use CLIP and LLaMA-2 / Vicuna to finetune a baseline model with instruction-following data. Our experimental results across various algorithms reveal that while visual instruction-tuning large language models (LLMs) can effectively learn meaningful representations from MAPLM-QA there remains significant room for further advancements.

Importantly the number of channels can range from one to a dozen and their correlation is often comparatively much lower than RGB as each of them brings specific information content. This aspect is largely overlooked by methods designed out of the bioimage field and current solutions mostly focus on intra-channel spatial attention often ignoring the relationship between channels yet crucial in most biological applications. Importantly the variable channel type and count prevent the projection of several experiments to a unified representation for large scale pre-training. In this study we propose ChAda-ViT a novel Channel Adaptive Vision Transformer architecture employing an Inter-Channel Attention mechanism on images with an arbitrary number order and type of channels. We also introduce IDRCell100k a bioimage dataset with a rich set of 79 experiments covering 7 microscope modalities with a multitude of channel types and channel counts varying from 1 to 10 per experiment. Our proposed architecture trained in a self-supervised manner outperforms existing approaches in several biologically relevant downstream tasks. Additionally it can be used to bridge the gap for the first time between assays with different microscopes channel numbers or types by embedding various image and experimental modalities into a unified biological image representation.

Our key idea is to create a neural interaction field attached to a specific object which outputs the distance to the valid interaction manifold given a human pose as input. This interaction field guides the sampling of an object-conditioned human motion diffusion model so as to encourage plausible contacts and affordance semantics. To support interactions with scarcely available data we propose an automated synthetic data pipeline. For this we seed a pre-trained motion model which has priors for the basics of human movement with interaction-specific anchor poses extracted from limited motion capture data. Using our guided diffusion model trained on generated synthetic data we synthesize realistic motions for sitting and lifting with several objects outperforming alternative approaches in terms of motion quality and successful action completion.

CVPR-2024-1,cvpr,2024,Learning Inclusion Matching for Animation Paint Bucket Colorization,"Yuekun Dai, Shangchen Zhou, Qinyue Li, Chongyi Li, Chen Change Loy",Colorizing line art is a pivotal task in the production of hand-drawn cel animation. This typically involves digital painters using a paint bucket tool to manually color each segment enclosed by lines based on RGB values predetermined by a color designer. This frame-by-frame process is both arduous and time-intensive. Current automated methods mainly focus on segment matching. This technique migrates colors from a reference to the target frame by aligning features within line-enclosed segments across frames. However issues like occlusion and wrinkles in animations often disrupt these direct correspondences leading to mismatches. In this work we introduce a new learning-based inclusion matching pipeline which directs the network to comprehend the inclusion relationships between segments rather than relying solely on direct visual correspondences. Our method features a two-stage pipeline that integrates a coarse color warping module with an inclusion matching module enabling more nuanced and accurate colorization. To facilitate the training of our network we also develope a unique dataset referred to as PaintBucket-Character. This dataset includes rendered line arts alongside their colorized counterparts featuring various 3D characters.

(ii) the diverse and complicated hybrid distortions are hard to distinguish. To tackle the above challenges and assist in the development of short-form videos we establish the first large-scale Kwai short Video database for Quality assessment termed KVQ which comprises 600 user-uploaded short videos and 3600 processed videos through the diverse practical processing workflows including pre-processing transcoding and enhancement. Among them the absolute quality score of each video and partial ranking score among indistinguish samples are provided by a team of professional researchers specializing in image processing. Based on this database we propose the first short-form video quality evaluator i.e. KSVQE which enables the quality evaluator to identify the quality-determined semantics with the content understanding of large vision language models (i.e. CLIP) and distinguish the distortions with the distortion under- standing module. Experimental results have shown the effectiveness of KSVQE on our KVQ database and popular VQA databases.

Vehicle-infrastructure cooperation (VIC) becomes one of the important research area. Due to the complexity of traffic conditions such as blind spots and occlusion it greatly limits the perception capabilities of single-view roadside sensing systems. To further enhance the accuracy of roadside perception and provide better information to the vehicle side in this paper we constructed holographic intersections with various layouts to build a large-scale multi-sensor holographic vehicle-infrastructure cooperation dataset called HoloVIC. Our dataset includes 3 different types of sensors (Camera Lidar Fisheye) and employs 4 sensor-layouts based on the different intersections. Each intersection is equipped with 6-18 sensors to capture synchronous data. While autonomous vehicles pass through these intersections for collecting VIC data. HoloVIC contains in total on 100k+ synchronous frames from different sensors. Additionally we annotated 3D bounding boxes based on Camera Fisheye and Lidar.

Previous works have developed image-to-image translation models which are trained on paired training data. However they are struggling to generate shadows with accurate shapes and intensities hindered by data scarcity and inherent task complexity. In this paper we resort to foundation model with rich prior knowledge of natural shadow images. Specifically we first adapt ControlNet to our task and then propose intensity modulation modules to improve the shadow intensity.

Among these coral reefs play an important and intricate role often referred to as the rainforests of the sea due to their rich biodiversity and crucial environmental impact. Existing coral analysis due to its technical complexity requires significant manual work from coral biologists therefore hindering scalable and comprehensive studies. In this paper we introduce CoralSCOP the first foundation model designed for the automatic dense segmentation of coral reefs. CoralSCOP is developed to accurately assign labels to different coral entities addressing the challenges in the semantic analysis of coral imagery. Its main objective is to identify and delineate the irregular boundaries between various coral individuals across different granularities such as coral/non-coral growth form and genus. This task is challenging due to the semantic agnostic nature or fixed limited semantic categories of previous generic segmentation methods which fail to adequately capture the complex characteristics of coral structures. By introducing a novel parallel semantic branch CoralSCOP can produce high-quality coral masks with semantics that enable a wide range of downstream coral reef analysis tasks. We demonstrate that CoralSCOP exhibits a strong zero-shot ability to segment unseen coral images. To effectively train our foundation model we propose CoralMask a new dataset with 41297 densely labeled coral images and 330144 coral masks. We have conducted comprehensive and extensive experiments to demonstrate the advantages of CoralSCOP over existing generalist segmentation algorithms and coral reef analytical approaches.,True,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Feng_CCEdit_Creative_and_Controllable_Video_Editing_via_Diffusion_Models_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf

Our approach for Hand Mesh Recovery HaMeR follows a fully transformer-based architecture and can analyze hands with significantly increased accuracy and robustness compared to previous work. The key to HaMeR's success lies in scaling up both the data used for training and the capacity of the deep network for hand reconstruction. For training data we combine multiple datasets that contain 2D or 3D hand annotations. For the deep model we use a large scale Vision Transformer architecture. Our final model consistently outperforms the previous baselines on popular 3D hand pose benchmarks.

Collins, Yiwen Luo, Yang Li, Kai J Kohlhoff, Deepak Ramachandran, Vidhya Navalpakkam",Recent Text-to-Image (T2I) generation models such as Stable Diffusion and Imagen have made significant progress in generating high-resolution images based on text descriptions. However many generated images still suffer from issues such as artifacts/implausibility misalignment with text descriptions and low aesthetic quality. Inspired by the success of Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) for large language models prior works collected human-provided scores as feedback on generated images and trained a reward model to improve the T2I generation. In this paper we enrich the feedback signal by (i) marking image regions that are implausible or misaligned with the text and (ii) annotating which words in the text prompt are misrepresented or missing on the image. We collect such rich human feedback on 18K generated images (RichHF-18K) and train a multimodal transformer to predict the rich feedback automatically. We show that the predicted rich human feedback can be leveraged to improve image generation for example by selecting high-quality training data to finetune and improve the generative models or by creating masks with predicted heatmaps to inpaint the problematic regions. Notably the improvements generalize to models (Muse) beyond those used to generate the images on which human feedback data were collected (Stable Diffusion variants).

CVPR-2024-1233,cvpr,2024,Revisiting Counterfactual Problems in Referring Expression Comprehension,"Zhihan Yu, Ruifan Li",Traditional referring expression comprehension (REC) aims to locate the target referent in an image guided by a text query. Several previous methods have studied on the Counterfactual problem in REC (C-REC) where the objects for a given query cannot be found in the image. However these methods focus on the overall image-text or specific attribute mismatch only. In this paper we address the C-REC problem from a deep perspective of fine-grained attributes. To this aim we first propose a fine-grained counterfactual sample generation method to construct C-REC datasets. Specifically we leverage pre-trained language model such as BERT to modify the attribute words in the queries obtaining the corresponding counterfactual samples. Furthermore we propose a C-REC framework. We first adopt three encoders to extract image text and attribute features. Then our dual-branch attentive fusion module fuses these cross-modal features with two branches by an attention mechanism. At last two prediction heads generate a bounding box and a counterfactual label respectively. In addition we incorporate contrastive learning with the generated counterfactual samples as negatives to enhance the counterfactual perception.

In this paper we present Desigen an automatic template creation pipeline which generates background images as well as harmonious layout elements over the background. Different from natural images a background image should preserve enough non-salient space for the overlaying layout elements. To equip existing advanced diffusion-based models with stronger spatial control we propose two simple but effective techniques to constrain the saliency distribution and reduce the attention weight in desired regions during the background generation process. Then conditioned on the background we synthesize the layout with a Transformer-based autoregressive generator. To achieve a more harmonious composition we propose an iterative inference strategy to adjust the synthesized background and layout in multiple rounds. We constructed a design dataset with more than 40k advertisement banners to verify our approach.

However prior work often tackles these tasks separately overlooking the benefit of mutual reinforcement from learning them jointly. In this paper we propose UniHuman a unified model that addresses multiple facets of human image editing in real-world settings. To enhance the model's generation quality and generalization capacity we leverage guidance from human visual encoders and introduce a lightweight pose-warping module that can exploit different pose representations accommodating unseen textures and patterns. Furthermore to bridge the disparity between existing human editing benchmarks with real-world data we curated 400K high-quality human image-text pairs for training and collected 2K human images for out-of-domain testing both encompassing diverse clothing styles backgrounds and age groups. Experiments on both in-domain and out-of-domain test sets demonstrate that UniHuman outperforms task-specific models by a significant margin. In user studies UniHuman is preferred by the users in an average of 77% of cases.

CVPR-2024-996,cvpr,2024,Video Recognition in Portrait Mode,"Mingfei Han, Linjie Yang, Xiaojie Jin, Jiashi Feng, Xiaojun Chang, Heng Wang",The creation of new datasets often presents new challenges for video recognition and can inspire novel ideas while addressing these challenges. While existing datasets mainly comprise landscape mode videos our paper seeks to introduce portrait mode videos to the research community and highlight the unique challenges associated with this video format. With the growing popularity of smartphones and social media applications recognizing portrait mode videos is becoming increasingly important. To this end we have developed the first dataset dedicated to portrait mode video recognition namely PortraitMode-400. The taxonomy of PortraitMode-400 was constructed in a data-driven manner comprising 400 fine-grained categories and rigorous quality assurance was implemented to ensure the accuracy of human annotations. In addition to the new dataset we conducted a comprehensive analysis of the impact of video format (portrait mode versus landscape mode) on recognition accuracy and spatial bias due to the different formats. Furthermore we designed extensive experiments to explore key aspects of portrait mode video recognition including the choice of data augmentation evaluation procedure the importance of temporal information and the role of audio modality. Building on the insights from our experimental results and the introduction of PortraitMode-400 our paper aims to inspire further research efforts in this emerging research area.,True,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Cen_Generating_Human_Motion_in_3D_Scenes_from_Text_Descriptions_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf

Ryoo",We introduce MAGICK a large-scale dataset of generated objects with high-quality alpha mattes. While image generation methods have produced segmentations they cannot generate alpha mattes with accurate details in hair fur and transparencies. This is likely due to the small size of current alpha matting datasets and the difficulty in obtaining ground-truth alpha. We propose a scalable method for synthesizing images of objects with high-quality alpha that can be used as a ground-truth dataset. A key idea is to generate objects on a single-colored background so chroma keying approaches can be used to extract the alpha. However this faces several challenges including that current text-to-image generation methods cannot create images that can be easily chroma keyed and that chroma keying is an underconstrained problem that generally requires manual intervention for high-quality results. We address this using a combination of generation and alpha extraction methods. Using our method we generate a dataset of 150000 objects with alpha. We show the utility of our dataset by training an alpha-to-rgb generation method that outperforms baselines.

CVPR-2024-1226,cvpr,2024,Referring Image Editing: Object-level Image Editing via Referring Expressions,"Chang Liu, Xiangtai Li, Henghui Ding",Significant advancements have been made in image editing with the recent advance of the Diffusion model. However most of the current methods primarily focus on global or subject-level modifications and often face limitations when it comes to editing specific objects when there are other objects coexisting in the scene given solely textual prompts. In response to this challenge we introduce an object-level generative task called Referring Image Editing (RIE) which enables the identification and editing of specific source objects in an image using text prompts. To tackle this task effectively we propose a tailored framework called ReferDiffusion. It aims to disentangle input prompts into multiple embeddings and employs a mixed-supervised multi-stage training strategy. To facilitate further research in this domain we introduce the RefCOCO-Edit dataset comprising images editing prompts source object segmentation masks and reference edited images for training and evaluation. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in identifying and editing target objects while conventional general image editing and region-based image editing methods have difficulties in this challenging task.,True,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Sato_Intriguing_Properties_of_Diffusion_Models_An_Empirical_Study_of_the_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf

This limitation is typically addressed through cumbersome prompt engineering scene layout conditioning or image editing techniques which often require hand drawn masks. Nonetheless pre-existing works struggle to take advantage of the natural instance-level compositionality of scenes due to the typically flat nature of rasterized RGB output images. Towards addressing this challenge we introduce MuLAn: a novel dataset comprising over 44K MUlti-Layer ANnotations of RGB images as multi-layer instance-wise RGBA decompositions and over 100K instance images. To build MuLAn we developed a training free pipeline which decomposes a monocular RGB image into a stack of RGBA layers comprising of background and isolated instances. We achieve this through the use of pretrained general-purpose models and by developing three modules: image decomposition for instance discovery and extraction instance completion to reconstruct occluded areas and image re-assembly. We use our pipeline to create MuLAn-COCO and MuLAn-LAION datasets which contain a variety of image decompositions in terms of style composition and complexity. With MuLAn we provide the first photorealistic resource providing instance decomposition and occlusion information for high quality images opening up new avenues for text-to-image generative AI research. With this we aim to encourage the development of novel generation and editing technology in particular layer-wise solutions.

F. Tan, Song Bai",Accurate and controllable image editing is a challenging task that has attracted significant attention recently. Notably DragGAN developed by Pan et al. (2023) is an interactive point-based image editing framework that achieves impressive editing results with pixel-level precision. However due to its reliance on generative adversarial networks (GANs) its generality is limited by the capacity of pretrained GAN models. In this work we extend this editing framework to diffusion models and propose a novel approach DragDiffusion. By harnessing large-scale pretrained diffusion models we greatly enhance the applicability of interactive point-based editing on both real and diffusion-generated images. Unlike other diffusion-based editing methods that provide guidance on diffusion latents of multiple time steps our approach achieves efficient yet accurate spatial control by optimizing the latent of only one time step. This novel design is motivated by our observations that UNet features at a specific time step provides sufficient semantic and geometric information to support the drag-based editing. Moreover we introduce two additional techniques namely identity-preserving fine-tuning and reference-latent-control to further preserve the identity of the original image. Lastly we present a challenging benchmark dataset called DragBench---the first benchmark to evaluate the performance of interactive point-based image editing methods. Experiments across a wide range of challenging cases (e.g. images with multiple objects diverse object categories various styles etc.) demonstrate the versatility and generality of DragDiffusion.

Black, Justus Thies, Timo Bolkart",We present SCULPT a novel 3D generative model for clothed and textured 3D meshes of humans. Specifically we devise a deep neural network that learns to represent the geometry and appearance distribution of clothed human bodies. Training such a model is challenging as datasets of textured 3D meshes for humans are limited in size and accessibility. Our key observation is that there exist medium-sized 3D scan datasets like CAPE as well as large-scale 2D image datasets of clothed humans and multiple appearances can be mapped to a single geometry. To effectively learn from the two data modalities we propose an unpaired learning procedure for pose-dependent clothed and textured human meshes. Specifically we learn a pose-dependent geometry space from 3D scan data. We represent this as per vertex displacements w.r.t. the SMPL model. Next we train a geometry conditioned texture generator in an unsupervised way using the 2D image data. We use intermediate activations of the learned geometry model to condition our texture generator. To alleviate entanglement between pose and clothing type and pose and clothing appearance we condition both the texture and geometry generators with attribute labels such as clothing types for the geometry and clothing colors for the texture generator. We automatically generated these conditioning labels for the 2D images based on the visual question-answering model BLIP and CLIP. We validate our method on the SCULPT dataset and compare to state-of-the-art 3D generative models for clothed human bodies.

In this work we focus on a novel yet challenging task of generating a coherent image sequence based on a given storyline denoted as open-ended visual storytelling. We make the following three contributions: (i) to fulfill the task of visual storytelling we propose a learning-based auto-regressive image generation model termed as StoryGen with a novel vision-language context module that enables to generate the current frame by conditioning on the corresponding text prompt and preceding image-caption pairs; (ii) to address the data shortage of visual storytelling we collect paired image-text sequences by sourcing from online videos and open-source E-books establishing processing pipeline for constructing a large-scale dataset with diverse characters storylines and artistic styles named StorySalon; (iii) Quantitative experiments and human evaluations have validated the superiority of our StoryGen where we show it can generalize to unseen characters without any optimization and generate image sequences with coherent content and consistent character.

However the methods used by existing frameworks to curate such multimodal data in particular language descriptions for 3D shapes are not scalable and the collected language descriptions are not diverse. To address this we introduce ULIP-2 a simple yet effective tri-modal pretraining framework that leverages large multimodal models to automatically generate holistic language descriptions for 3D shapes. It only needs 3D data as input eliminating the need for any manual 3D annotations and is therefore scalable to large datasets. ULIP-2 is also equipped with scaled-up backbones for better multi-modal representation learning. We conduct experiments on two large-scale 3D datasets Objaverse and ShapeNet and augment them with tri-modal datasets of 3D point clouds images and language for training ULIP-2. Experiments show that ULIP-2 demonstrates substantial benefits in three downstream tasks: zero-shot 3D classification standard 3D classification with fine-tuning and 3D captioning (3D-to-language generation). It achieves a new SOTA of 50.6% (top- 1) on Objaverse-LVIS and 84.7% (top-1) on ModelNet40 in zero-shot classification. In the ScanObjectNN benchmark for standard fine-tuning ULIP-2 reaches an overall accuracy of 91.5% with a compact model of only 1.4 million parameters. ULIP-2 sheds light on a new paradigm for scalable multimodal 3D representation learning without human annotations and shows significant improvements over existing baselines.

The dataset contains high-resolution photographs of windows selected from locations around the world with 89318 individual window crops showcasing diverse geometric and material characteristics. We evaluate a procedural model by training semantic segmentation networks on both synthetic and real images and then comparing their performances on a shared test set of real images. Specifically we measure the difference in mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) and determine the effective number of real images to match synthetic data's training performance. We design a baseline procedural model as a benchmark and provide 21290 synthetically generated images. By tuning the procedural model key factors are identified which significantly influence the model's fidelity in replicating real-world scenarios. Importantly we highlight the challenge of procedural modeling using current techniques especially in their ability to replicate the spatial semantics of real-world scenarios. This insight is critical because of the potential of procedural models to bridge hidden scene aspects such as depth reflectivity material properties and lighting conditions.,True,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Ling_Align_Your_Gaussians_Text-to-4D_with_Dynamic_3D_Gaussians_and_Composed_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf

However this approach faces challenges in modeling scene dynamics in urban environments where moving objects of various categories and scales are present. In such settings it becomes crucial to effectively eliminate moving objects to accurately reconstruct static backgrounds. Our research introduces an innovative method termed here as Entity-NeRF which combines the strengths of knowledge-based and statistical strategies. This approach utilizes entity-wise statistics leveraging entity segmentation and stationary entity classification through thing/stuff segmentation. To assess our methodology we created an urban scene dataset masked with moving objects.

However general instance segmentation frameworks are incompetent due to 1) the subtle differences between some teeth' shapes (e.g. maxillary first premolar and second premolar) 2) the teeth's position and shape variation across subjects and 3) the presence of abnormalities in the dentition (e.g. caries and edentulism). To address these problems we propose a ViT-based framework named TeethSEG which consists of stacked Multi-Scale Aggregation (MSA) blocks and an Anthropic Prior Knowledge (APK) layer. Specifically to compose the two modules we design 1) a unique permutation-based upscaler to ensure high efficiency while establishing clear segmentation boundaries with 2) multi-head self/cross-gating layers to emphasize particular semantics meanwhile maintaining the divergence between token embeddings. Besides we collect 3) the first open-sourced intraoral image dataset IO150K which comprises over 150k intraoral photos and all photos are annotated by orthodontists using a human-machine hybrid algorithm.

Rehg",We study the problem of single-image zero-shot 3D shape reconstruction. Recent works learn zero-shot shape reconstruction through generative modeling of 3D assets but these models are computationally expensive at train and inference time. In contrast the traditional approach to this problem is regression-based where deterministic models are trained to directly regress the object shape. Such regression methods possess much higher computational efficiency than generative methods. This raises a natural question: is generative modeling necessary for high performance or conversely are regression-based approaches still competitive? To answer this we design a strong regression-based model called ZeroShape based on the converging findings in this field and a novel insight. We also curate a large real-world evaluation benchmark with objects from three different real-world 3D datasets. This evaluation benchmark is more diverse and an order of magnitude larger than what prior works use to quantitatively evaluate their models aiming at reducing the evaluation variance in our field. We show that ZeroShape not only achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art methods but also demonstrates significantly higher computational and data efficiency.,True,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Wang_Move_as_You_Say_Interact_as_You_Can_Language-guided_Human_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
CVPR-2024-2659,cvpr,2024,From a Bird's Eye View to See: Joint Camera and Subject Registration without the Camera Calibration,"Zekun Qian, Ruize Han, Wei Feng, Song Wang",We tackle a new problem of multi-view camera and subject registration in the bird's eye view (BEV) without pre-given camera calibration which promotes the multi-view subject registration problem to a new calibration-free stage. This greatly alleviates the limitation in many practical applications. However this is a very challenging problem since its only input is several RGB images from different first-person views (FPVs) without the BEV image and the calibration of the FPVs while the output is a unified plane aggregated from all views with the positions and orientations of both the subjects and cameras in a BEV. For this purpose we propose an end-to-end framework solving camera and subject registration together by taking advantage of their mutual dependence whose main idea is as below: i) creating a subject view-transform module (VTM) to project each pedestrian from FPV to a virtual BEV ii) deriving a multi-view geometry-based spatial alignment module (SAM) to estimate the relative camera pose in a unified BEV iii) selecting and refining the subject and camera registration results within the unified BEV.

Current multi-modal large language models however passively absorb sensory data as inputs lacking the capacity to actively interact with the objects in the 3D environment and dynamically collect their multisensory information. To usher in the study of this area we propose MultiPLY a multisensory embodied large language model that could incorporate multisensory interactive data including visual audio tactile and thermal information into large language models thereby establishing the correlation among words actions and percepts. To this end we first collect Multisensory Universe a large-scale multisensory interaction dataset comprising 500k data by deploying an LLM-powered embodied agent to engage with the 3D environment. To perform instruction tuning with pre-trained LLM on such generated data we first encode the 3D scene as abstracted object-centric representations and then introduce action tokens denoting that the embodied agent takes certain actions within the environment as well as state tokens that represent the multisensory state observations of the agent at each time step. In the inference time MultiPLY could generate action tokens instructing the agent to take the action in the environment and obtain the next multisensory state observation. The observation is then appended back to the LLM via state tokens to generate subsequent text or action tokens. We demonstrate that MultiPLY outperforms baselines by a large margin through a diverse set of embodied tasks involving object retrieval tool use multisensory captioning and task decomposition.,True,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Zhao_Improving_Birds_Eye_View_Semantic_Segmentation_by_Task_Decomposition_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf

Prior state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods only focus on the reconstruction of the visible areas in a scene neglecting the invisible areas due to the occlusions e.g. the contact surface between furniture occluded wall and floor. Our method tackles the task of completing the occluded scene surfaces resulting in a complete 3D scene mesh. The core idea of our method is learning 3D geometry prior from various complete scenes to infer the occluded geometry of an unseen scene from solely depth measurements. We design a coarse-fine hierarchical octree representation coupled with a dual-decoder architecture i.e. Geo-decoder and 3D Inpainter which jointly reconstructs the complete 3D scene geometry. The Geo-decoder with detailed representation at fine levels is optimized online for each scene to reconstruct visible surfaces. The 3D Inpainter with abstract representation at coarse levels is trained offline using various scenes to complete occluded surfaces. As a result while the Geo-decoder is specialized for an individual scene the 3D Inpainter can be generally applied across different scenes. We evaluate the proposed method on the 3D Completed Room Scene (3D-CRS) and iTHOR datasets significantly outperforming the SOTA methods by a gain of 16.8% and 24.2% in terms of the completeness of 3D reconstruction. 3D-CRS dataset including a complete 3D mesh of each scene is provided at project webpage.,True,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Lin_VastGaussian_Vast_3D_Gaussians_for_Large_Scene_Reconstruction_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf

CVPR-2024-1505,cvpr,2024,Efficient Meshflow and Optical Flow Estimation from Event Cameras,"Xinglong Luo, Ao Luo, Zhengning Wang, Chunyu Lin, Bing Zeng, Shuaicheng Liu",In this paper we explore the problem of event-based meshflow estimation a novel task that involves predicting a spatially smooth sparse motion field from event cameras. To start we generate a large-scale High-Resolution Event Meshflow (HREM) dataset which showcases its superiority by encompassing the merits of high resolution at 1280x720 handling dynamic objects and complex motion patterns and offering both optical flow and meshflow labels. These aspects have not been fully explored in previous works. Besides we propose Efficient Event-based MeshFlow (EEMFlow) network a lightweight model featuring a specially crafted encoder-decoder architecture to facilitate swift and accurate meshflow estimation. Furthermore we upgrade EEMFlow network to support dense event optical flow in which a Confidence-induced Detail Completion (CDC) module is proposed to preserve sharp motion boundaries. We conduct comprehensive experiments to show the exceptional performance and runtime efficiency (39x faster) of our EEMFlow model compared to recent state-of-the-art flow methods.

CVPR-2024-182,cvpr,2024,Detector-Free Structure from Motion,"Xingyi He, Jiaming Sun, Yifan Wang, Sida Peng, Qixing Huang, Hujun Bao, Xiaowei Zhou",We propose a structure-from-motion framework to recover accurate camera poses and point clouds from unordered images. Traditional SfM systems typically rely on the successful detection of repeatable keypoints across multiple views as the first step which is difficult for texture-poor scenes and poor keypoint detection may break down the whole SfM system. We propose a detector-free SfM framework to draw benefits from the recent success of detector-free matchers to avoid the early determination of keypoints while solving the multi-view inconsistency issue of detector-free matchers. Specifically our framework first reconstructs a coarse SfM model from quantized detector-free matches. Then it refines the model by a novel iterative refinement pipeline which iterates between an attention-based multi-view matching module to refine feature tracks and a geometry refinement module to improve the reconstruction accuracy. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms existing detector-based SfM systems on common benchmark datasets. We also collect a texture-poor SfM dataset to demonstrate the capability of our framework to reconstruct texture-poor scenes. Based on this framework we take first place in Image Matching Challenge 2023.,True,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Wang_Attention-Driven_Training-Free_Efficiency_Enhancement_of_Diffusion_Models_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
CVPR-2024-490,cvpr,2024,LiveHPS: LiDAR-based Scene-level Human Pose and Shape Estimation in Free Environment,"Yiming Ren, Xiao Han, Chengfeng Zhao, Jingya Wang, Lan Xu, Jingyi Yu, Yuexin Ma",For human-centric large-scale scenes fine-grained modeling for 3D human global pose and shape is significant for scene understanding and can benefit many real-world applications. In this paper we present LiveHPS a novel single-LiDAR-based approach for scene-level human pose and shape estimation without any limitation of light conditions and wearable devices. In particular we design a distillation mechanism to mitigate the distribution-varying effect of LiDAR point clouds and exploit the temporal-spatial geometric and dynamic information existing in consecutive frames to solve the occlusion and noise disturbance. LiveHPS with its efficient configuration and high-quality output is well-suited for real-world applications. Moreover we propose a huge human motion dataset named FreeMotion which is collected in various scenarios with diverse human poses shapes and translations. It consists of multi-modal and multi-view acquisition data from calibrated and synchronized LiDARs cameras and IMUs. Extensive experiments on our new dataset and other public datasets demonstrate the SOTA performance and robustness of our approach. We will release our code and dataset soon.,True,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Chen_DSL-FIQA_Assessing_Facial_Image_Quality_via_Dual-Set_Degradation_Learning_and_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
CVPR-2024-1821,cvpr,2024,Towards Automatic Power Battery Detection: New Challenge Benchmark Dataset and Baseline,"Xiaoqi Zhao, Youwei Pang, Zhenyu Chen, Qian Yu, Lihe Zhang, Hanqi Liu, Jiaming Zuo, Huchuan Lu",We conduct a comprehensive study on a new task named power battery detection (PBD) which aims to localize the dense cathode and anode plates endpoints from X-ray images to evaluate the quality of power batteries. Existing manufacturers usually rely on human eye observation to complete PBD which makes it difficult to balance the accuracy and efficiency of detection. To address this issue and drive more attention into this meaningful task we first elaborately collect a dataset called X-ray PBD which has 1500 diverse X-ray images selected from thousands of power batteries of 5 manufacturers with 7 different visual interference. Then we propose a novel segmentation-based solution for PBD termed multi-dimensional collaborative network (MDCNet). With the help of line and counting predictors the representation of the point segmentation branch can be improved at both semantic and detail aspects. Besides we design an effective distance-adaptive mask generation strategy which can alleviate the visual challenge caused by the inconsistent distribution density of plates to provide MDCNet with stable supervision. Without any bells and whistles our segmentation-based MDCNet consistently outperforms various other corner detection crowd counting and general/tiny object detection-based solutions making it a strong baseline that can help facilitate future research in PBD. Finally we share some potential difficulties and works for future researches.

CVPR-2024-1096,cvpr,2024,Learning Disentangled Identifiers for Action-Customized Text-to-Image Generation,"Siteng Huang, Biao Gong, Yutong Feng, Xi Chen, Yuqian Fu, Yu Liu, Donglin Wang",This study focuses on a novel task in text-to-image (T2I) generation namely action customization. The objective of this task is to learn the co-existing action from limited data and generalize it to unseen humans or even animals. Experimental results show that existing subject-driven customization methods fail to learn the representative characteristics of actions and struggle in decoupling actions from context features including appearance. To overcome the preference for low-level features and the entanglement of high-level features we propose an inversion-based method Action-Disentangled Identifier (ADI) to learn action-specific identifiers from the exemplar images. ADI first expands the semantic conditioning space by introducing layer-wise identifier tokens thereby increasing the representational richness while distributing the inversion across different features. Then to block the inversion of action-agnostic features ADI extracts the gradient invariance from the constructed sample triples and masks the updates of irrelevant channels. To comprehensively evaluate the task we present an ActionBench that includes a variety of actions each accompanied by meticulously selected samples. Both quantitative and qualitative results show that our ADI outperforms existing baselines in action-customized T2I generation.

CVPR-2024-572,cvpr,2024,Rethinking the Up-Sampling Operations in CNN-based Generative Network for Generalizable Deepfake Detection,"Chuangchuang Tan, Yao Zhao, Shikui Wei, Guanghua Gu, Ping Liu, Yunchao Wei",Recently the proliferation of highly realistic synthetic images facilitated through a variety of GANs and Diffusions has significantly heightened the susceptibility to misuse. While the primary focus of deepfake detection has traditionally centered on the design of detection algorithms an investigative inquiry into the generator architectures has remained conspicuously absent in recent years. This paper contributes to this lacuna by rethinking the architectures of CNN-based generator thereby establishing a generalized representation of synthetic artifacts. Our findings illuminate that the up-sampling operator can beyond frequency-based artifacts produce generalized forgery artifacts. In particular the local interdependence among image pixels caused by upsampling operators is significantly demonstrated in synthetic images generated by GAN or diffusion. Building upon this observation we introduce the concept of Neighboring Pixel Relationships(NPR) as a means to capture and characterize the generalized structural artifacts stemming from up-sampling operations. A comprehensive analysis is conducted on an open-world dataset comprising samples generated by 28 distinct generative models. This analysis culminates in the establishment of a novel state-of-the-art performance showcasing a remarkable 12.8% improvement over existing methods.

CVPR-2024-1461,cvpr,2024,The Audio-Visual Conversational Graph: From an Egocentric-Exocentric Perspective,"Wenqi Jia, Miao Liu, Hao Jiang, Ishwarya Ananthabhotla, James M. Rehg, Vamsi Krishna Ithapu, Ruohan Gao",In recent years the thriving development of research related to egocentric videos has provided a unique perspective for the study of conversational interactions where both visual and audio signals play a crucial role. While most prior work focus on learning about behaviors that directly involve the camera wearer we introduce the Ego-Exocentric Conversational Graph Prediction problem marking the first attempt to infer exocentric conversational interactions from egocentric videos. We propose a unified multi-modal framework---Audio-Visual Conversational Attention (AV-CONV) for the joint prediction of conversation behaviors---speaking and listening---for both the camera wearer as well as all other social partners present in the egocentric video. Specifically we adopt the self-attention mechanism to model the representations across-time across-subjects and across-modalities. To validate our method we conduct experiments on a challenging egocentric video dataset that includes multi-speaker and multi-conversation scenarios. Our results demonstrate the superior performance of our method compared to a series of baselines. We also present detailed ablation studies to assess the contribution of each component in our model.

CVPR-2024-640,cvpr,2024,LEMON: Learning 3D Human-Object Interaction Relation from 2D Images,"Yuhang Yang, Wei Zhai, Hongchen Luo, Yang Cao, Zheng-Jun Zha",Learning 3D human-object interaction relation is pivotal to embodied AI and interaction modeling. Most existing methods approach the goal by learning to predict isolated interaction elements e.g. human contact object affordance and human-object spatial relation primarily from the perspective of either the human or the object. Which underexploit certain correlations between the interaction counterparts (human and object) and struggle to address the uncertainty in interactions. Actually objects' functionalities potentially affect humans' interaction intentions which reveals what the interaction is. Meanwhile the interacting humans and objects exhibit matching geometric structures which presents how to interact. In light of this we propose harnessing these inherent correlations between interaction counterparts to mitigate the uncertainty and jointly anticipate the above interaction elements in 3D space. To achieve this we present LEMON (LEarning 3D huMan-Object iNteraction relation) a unified model that mines interaction intentions of the counterparts and employs curvatures to guide the extraction of geometric correlations combining them to anticipate the interaction elements. Besides the 3D Interaction Relation dataset (3DIR) is collected to serve as the test bed for training and evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of LEMON over methods estimating each element in isolation.

CVPR-2024-2207,cvpr,2024,FlashEval: Towards Fast and Accurate Evaluation of Text-to-image Diffusion Generative Models,"Lin Zhao, Tianchen Zhao, Zinan Lin, Xuefei Ning, Guohao Dai, Huazhong Yang, Yu Wang",In recent years there has been significant progress in the development of text-to-image generative models. Evaluating the quality of the generative models is one essential step in the development process. Unfortunately the evaluation process could consume a significant amount of computational resources making the required periodic evaluation of model performance (e.g. monitoring training progress) impractical. Therefore we seek to improve the evaluation efficiency by selecting the representative subset of the text-image dataset. We systematically investigate the design choices including the selection criteria (textural features or imagebased metrics) and the selection granularity (prompt-level or set-level). We find that the insights from prior work on subset selection for training data do not generalize to this problem and we propose FlashEval an iterative search algorithm tailored to evaluation data selection. We demonstrate the effectiveness of FlashEval on ranking diffusion models with various configurations including architectures quantization levels and sampler schedules on COCO and DiffusionDB datasets. Our searched 50-item subset could achieve comparable evaluation quality to the randomly sampled 500-item subset for COCO annotations on unseen models achieving a 10x evaluation speedup. We release the condensed subset of these commonly used datasets to help facilitate diffusion algorithm design and evaluation and open-source FlashEval as a tool for condensing future datasets accessible at https://github.com/thu-nics/FlashEval.,True,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Ho_SiTH_Single-view_Textured_Human_Reconstruction_with_Image-Conditioned_Diffusion_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf
